    "_sentence = \"\"\"Last week, I had what I've been calling a \"pothole moment\"-- a flare of intense feeling that tripped me up. At our fall conference, my son's middle school guidance counselor suggested that the pandemic years would have been the ideal time for him to learn to type, even though, to my knowledge, during those years, his school never once mentioned typing. She told me that no, the school isn't going to circle back to teach it, though it's clearly increasingly necessary. But maybe, the counselor suggested brightly, I could just teach my son now?  As it turned out, the call to \"just\" do anything made my breath come short. I mean, didn't I just nearly break my own soul keeping my two kids from loneliness and despair for two tough years, making sure that they learned a few things for when the world woke up again? Didn't I teach swimming when there were no swim lessons, and every last game I knew during the long summer when there was no camp? Isn't it a miracle that either kid knows any math at all?  In front of the guidance counselor, I found myself growing tense. \"No,\" I said. \"I cannot 'just' teach anything right now.\" I heard the little snarl in my throat. Heart racing, I stepped back to find a new tone. In perhaps an overshare, or perhaps just what the moment needed, I told the woman in front of me that I'd just been swamped by sudden deep grief -- not about typing, but for all that's been broken, for the crazy years we've been through.  And, with a bit of grace, the counselor saw me. She was kind. She got it. \"It's normal,\" she said. \"We're all sort of that way.\"  So that's me, waving my hand, sharing my pothole. I think I'm not alone, that a lot of our roads these days can veer into the uneven without much warning. As we move towards a holiday season where many of us will gather with family and friends, it's interesting to notice all we're holding: The lingering pandemic and its aftereffects. The long shadow of a world at war. Grief about climate change. Grief about gun violence. Fear about the price of gas and groceries. And other rifts -- in our families, in our towns, in our country. Some of these feel like they will never be mended.  Yet alongside noting the general tenderness I find in myself and others, I've also been thinking about joy, what it is, how to find it. As it happens, I'm not alone. There are at least three books this fall that take up the call to think about joy and ask us to think with them. As the holidays approach, I've been reading them. I don't know about you, but sometimes the call to holiday joy puts me in an uneasy place. But these three books are actually about moving past what feels forced and fake towards what might feel genuine and alive, together.  In short, as we all begin to try to think about what it might mean to really be near one another, these books have a lot to offer now.  The books -- and this is not the start of a joke -- are actually by a poet, a psychoanalyst and a pastor, three lovely people who certainly should all walk into a bar together to chat. Poet Ross Gay's \"Inciting Joy\" makes the pursuit of joy feel positively radical. Poet and psychoanalyst Nuar Alsadir's \"Animal Joy\" is, among other things, an exploration of the unexpected art of really laughing. And in \"How to Begin When Your World Is Ending, A Spiritual Field Guide to Joy Despite Everything,\" pastor Molly Phinney Baskette -- who's lived through cancer and tended the griefs of her congregants -- doesn't quite offer a how-to manual, but in some ways, it comes close.  These three books share common wisdoms: That joy is not really about scripted, expected or store-bought things. It is more about the unscripted realm of deep connection, the willingness to be vulnerable, to be present with sorrow, to be honest, to be surprised. It's sharing the unexpected, rather than holding it back. It's also about the moments when, despite all, we feel met.  Tellingly, none of these books are about joy alone. There's an awful lot of suffering baked in -- the loss of parents, the loss of children, the loss of the selves we thought we were. Even what is funny can be upending: \"Every joke is a tiny revolution\" says Alsadir, quoting George Orwell, also noting that many standup routines could be tragedy in another tone.  As a poet and psychoanalyst, Alsadir is fascinated by the way moments that make us laugh and feel deeply happen when the tender and taboo parts of life see the light. When something -- our deep laughter, our authentic grief -- upends the narratives we'd rather keep steady, we also discover the possibility for transformation.  For Phinney Baskette, the pastor, the process of joy comes in trusting that these broken open moments -- where we may feel most lost -- are actually the places where we might just connect more deeply to ourselves, to others, and to the strength we need to go on. Joy emerges when we can call out to people -- as she did when she was presiding over Holy Week after discovering she had cancer and found herself unexpectedly asking three congregants to pray for her, instead.  Perhaps my favorite description of joy comes from Gay's book. In what's a very long metaphor, a shaggy dog parable of its own, Gay describes joy as the potluck we come to, to greet our old companion, Sorrow. The potluck is vast: \"We put our mechanic on the list, our chiropractor, and the neighbors we wave at but not much more than that.\"  And then it turns out that as we bring our dishes, and as we put out our index cards in front of them, saying whether they have nuts or gluten or dairy, as we greet each other, introducing our sorrows, something uproarious happens: The party gets joyous, and zany, and most importantly, real. Suddenly we are \"sweaty, stomping and shaking, tearing it up, the pictures falling off the walls, the books from the shelves, some logs ablaze even spilling from the stove, riotous this care, this carrying this excitement, this joy.\" Suddenly, in other words, having invited in our sorrows, we can finally dance at the party of our lives.  As we come to the Thanksgiving holiday, I can't help but think about this, about bringing our dishes to friends and loved ones, and bringing also what is real, hungry, and vulnerable too.  I had a glimpse of this lately, how good it could be. I was recently away for a weekend among some brilliant writer friends, some of the smartest women I know. Many of us haven't seen each other in years. We started in delight just to be together again. We shared new work, wine, ideas, hugs.  But later in the weekend, something deeper started to happen. We brought more of ourselves to the table. I heard from a friend with an eating disorder, one who had cancer during the pandemic, one losing her ex-husband to drug addiction, one who'd been shut out of a dream job, and is trying -- quite bravely -- to work around bitterness. I was able to talk about my potholes, my exhaustion, my long burnout and the feeling trying to chart my way in the dark.  We all laughed a lot. I cried in front of my friend Nicole. \"It's totally ok to be fragile,\" she said. \"We're all fragile now.\"  Yeah, and maybe we're ready to be joyful, too. It's winter. It's cold. The holidays are coming. We're about to try to find light in darkness. We're about to gather with a bunch of people we love, and those we try hard to.  Sometimes those people we try to love are the very same people who also make us feel, and sometimes the feelings are challenging. In other words, the holidays are full of potholes. The holidays are coming. The world is going to try to sell us the kind of joy we can buy in stores. What I'm hoping for also -- for each of us -- is that we find some togetherness, some real community. I'm hoping that we make it to that potluck, where we laugh and laugh and laugh.\"\"\"\n",

      "[{'text': 'The Statement A Facebook video claiming to show a piece of 5G equipment labelled “COV.19” is being shared on Facebook as conspiracy theorists and 5G opponents target telecom masts in the UK and other parts of Europe. The May 14 Facebook video features a man wearing a face mask, a clean yellow hardhat and and orange hi-vis jacket, who claims to have been “working erecting 5G masts on towers like the one behind me … while everybody else has been in lockdown”. The man claims he has opened a “5G kit” despite being “explicitly asked not to”. The camera then turns to a piece of circuit board he is holding. In the upper left corner of the board is a silver component with a label on it that reads “COV.19”. The man then says: “This is a piece of f…ing 5G kit and it says COV-19 on it. I don’t really know of any product or any company that produces circuitry like this, but that’s the brand name, COV-dot-19”. He then goes on to claim while panning the camera up at an unidentified telecommunications tower: “I’m not a f…ing conspiracy theorist, obviously I’ve read all that stuff online about coronavirus and COVID-19, but why the f… are they putting circuitry like that in towers like that?” The caption on the video reads: “Covid-19 circuit boards being installed in 5G towers yeah ok” with two laughing emojis. The May 14 Facebook video has been viewed over 160,000 times, been shared over 10,000 times and attracted over 950 likes. A still image from the video has appeared in a Facebook post here and the video appears on Instagram here A still from a video in which a man claims to be a 5G installer with a component labelled “COV.19”. The Analysis The 5G network is the fifth generation of cellular mobile networks. The technology allows for faster data transfers, lower latency and will allow the connection of more devices to a mobile network at any one time. Telco companies including Telstra are currently rolling out 5G networks around capital cities in Australia, while a recent Parliamentary Report into the technology declared it will underpin a fourth industrial revolution in this country. During the COVID-19 crisis conspiracy theories seeking to connect the virus to the rollout of 5G technology have spread on social media networks. The theories have been debunked by experts and government agencies, but phone masts have still been attacked in the UK and other parts of Europe. The man in the May 14 video presents himself as an installer of 5G equipment at an unidentified location. The man, who wears a face mask, hardhat and hi-vis jacket, has a British accent and stands beside a blue van. Across a road, on the far side of a brick wall, is a telecommunications tower. The man claims he has been “installing 5G masts on towers” despite masts and towers being different support structures used in telecommuncations networks. During the one minute video the man waves around a piece of blue electronic circuit board that has on it a component labelled with a sticker that reads “COV.19”. He says: “this is a piece of 5G kit and it says COV 19 on it”. Through initial comments on the post and then by further research, AAP FactCheck identified the circuit board in the video as a component used in a Virgin Media (UK) pay-TV set top box. Virgin Media told AAP FactCheck in an email the component looks like a piece of hardware used in a set-top box, the Cisco 4585 HD (non-PVR) set top box, issued around nine years ago. “That is a board from a very old set top TV box and which never featured any component parts inscribed/stamped/printed or otherwise with COV 19. It has absolutely no relation with any mobile network infrastructure, including that used for 5G,” a Virgin Media spokesperson said. There are other signs that the component featured in the video is not what it’s claimed to be and is in fact from a set top box. At the 13-second mark the video shows the circuit board has a SCART connector – a 21 pin connector used to connect visual/audio equipment and an RF cable-in connector, a standard connector for a coaxial cable, as seen on the back of this Cisco set top box on the left of the image. At 59 seconds into the Facebook video, the marking “Hannstar J MV-1” is clearly visible at the bottom of the piece of hardware. HannStar Display Corporation is a Taiwanese company that manufactures components for computer monitors, televisions and notebook displays. The last few frames of the video also show a what appears to be a disassembled black casing on the bonnet of the blue van. The casing resembles that of a set top box or similar device. A piece of circuit board seen in a Facebook video is not from a telecommunications tower.', 'label': 1, 'dataset': 'mmcovid_en', 'distance': 0.0}, {'text': 'CORONAVIRUS HOAX: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome 5G SYNDROME GOES GLOBAL Wuhan coronavirus pandemic STAGED to cover-up the public health crisis caused by the intensive 5G roll-out in Wuhan in 2019 State of the Nation “China was long ago set to be the 5G showcase for the world. Major metro areas and technology hubs like Wuhan were selected to be official 5G Demonstration Zones. Only such a high concentration of 5G radio-frequency transmitters and microwave towers would permit a citywide build-out of the Internet of Things. 2019 was the year Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, was “expected to have 10,000 5G base stations by the end of 2019, said Song Qizhu, head of Hubei Provincial Communication Administration”.[1] Then the coronavirus hit, so the whole world was told. What really happened was that a new variant of the coronavirus was released in Wuhan after the 5G experimenters saw an epidemic of 5G Syndrome explode. The 5G guinea pigs were literally dropping like flies as soon as they flipped the 5G switch. The ERs and urgent care clinics were overwhelmed. The 5G scientists watching the burgeoning public health crisis immediately activated Plan B: Blame it on a virulent flu—a bioengineered coronavirus that produces symptoms similar to 5G Syndrome.” — Intelligence Analyst and Former U.S. Army Officer The New World Order globalist cabal will not allow anything to impede the military deployment of 5G worldwide. That’s it! ~~~ END OF STORY ~~~ 5G Syndrome Maps Perfectly with Coronavirus Outbreaks There’s a LOT of hard evidence now emerging the further away we get from the original crime scene in Wuhan, China and as the coronavirus pops up around the world in 5G Hotspots that indicates this pandemic is being manufactured for multiple reasons. As it turns out, those nations with the most advanced 5G roll-outs have the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases, both infection rates and death rates. In those countries that have permitted IoT build-outs where the 5G power grids are the most developed, the coronavirus infection rate is taking off. What’s really interesting is that Africa has thus far shown very few cases. As of this weekend there were only 3 medically acknowledged cases on the entire continent. Which begs the question: How do the Third World countries in Africa avoid such a contagious strain of the coronavirus given the pervasive lack of proper sanitation and necessary hygiene? In light of how deeply involved the Chinese are with development projects all over Africa, it’s quite curious how that infection number is still so low. Perhaps it’s directly related to the absence of 5G roll-outs in the vast majority of African nations. Before those nations suffering the greatest number of coronavirus infections to date are further investigated — China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, United States, France, Spain, Kuwait — another curious development ought to be looked at closely. The Proof is in the Cruise Ships The single best proof of the quite obvious 5G-Coronavirus linkage are the various cruise ships that have seen an inexplicable mushrooming of coronavirus cases, even after all the passengers were quarantined. Many of the biggest cruise lines now advertise the fact that they have the latest and greatest 5G technologies in place. The most advanced cruise ships actually possess the best examples of what the Internet of Things (IoT) will look like in the future … if the build-outs proceed unimpeded by the very serious health concerns and safety issues. KEY POINT: Cruise-goers, by and large, love to stay connected with the folks back home. They especially enjoy texting their many photos-by-smartphone back to family and friends. Businessmen have a need to stay in touch with the office as other passengers want to stay abreast of all the breaking news in 2020. Hence, every cruise ship will eventually become a 5G–IoT paradise if they’re not already. What really happened on the quarantined cruise ships is that those folks were likely quite vulnerable to the flu bug for a variety of reasons. Then, when they entered the fully operational 5G space* on the ships, their immunity was profoundly weakened so that they would be susceptible any influenza strain, including the Wuhan coronavirus—COVID-19. *The cruise lines have literally put their 5G technology on super-steroids as seen in this promotion: MedallionNet™: The Best Wi-Fi at Sea. 5G Nations It has also been astutely observed that those nations with the most pervasive and powerful 5G networks fully functioning are those that have suffered the biggest outbreaks of the coronavirus to date. Why should anyone be surprised at this wholly predictable outcome? The following excerpt comes from: CORONAVIRUS BOMBSHELL: This proves it should be named “5G COVID-19” The importance of viewing the coronavirus COVID-19 as a “Telephone Disease” is that by doing so it explains some perplexing mysteries about the spread of this disease—such as why this disease has struck the Gulf nations and monarchies in the Persian Gulf region, but becomes explainable when one notices their ongoing 5G revolution—most particularly in Iran, where this country is completely blanketed to its smallest village with 4G technology coverage—but who are now putting the finishing touches on rolling out 5G technology throughout their entire nation in the coming weeks—finishing touches that included Iran activating their Chinese bought 5G technology for testing—that was immediately met by Iran having more coronavirus cases and deaths of any nation outside of China—and whose Vice President is one of seven of their top government officials now infected. Coronavirus COVID-19 disease outbreak begins to spread in Persian Gulf nations and monarchies activating 5G technology. Both 5G Demonstration Zones such as Wuhan, China and floating 5G cruise liners are correctly considered 5G Hotspots. These 5G Hotspots, for the uninitiated, are really KILL ZONES because many folks will die early the longer they bask in those dangerously high levels of 5G radio-frequencies and microwave radiation. The following excerpt from a previous exposé provides critical links for every individual who lives, works and/or plays in a 5G Super-Hotspots. Which brings us to the single most perilous aspect of the military deployment of 5G—KILL ZONES. All the scientific evidence available in the public domain now indicates that wherever 5G infrastructure is located in the greatest concentration generating the most powerful EMFs and microwaves, those 5G Super-Hotspots will effectively function as kill zones. As follows: In order to fully grasp the highly destructive and deadly potential of these rapidly emerging 5G Super-Hotspots, the following video exposé presents a scenario where the most powerful “directed energy weapons” will be located within these 5G kill zones. Which bring us to the primary purpose of this article—5G Syndrome. 5G Syndrome 5G Syndrome is a relatively new disease that has yet to go mainstream because of how its official recognition would immediately terminate the ongoing 5G roll-out. Exactly what are the symptoms of 5G Syndrome? There are many, and they manifest differently in each victim of this insidious disease. Of course, a good number of typical flu symptoms mimic 5G Syndrome. But what’s most important is that these two illnesses — Influenza and 5G Syndrome — will mutually sustain each other. In that way, it can be quite confusing to accurately tease out which symptoms are associated with which disease. In other words, if you have the flu, your exposure to 5G will make it much worse. Likewise, if you have a case of full-blown 5G Syndrome, you will be much more susceptible to getting the flu, and if you do, it will be significantly worse. Back to the primary symptoms. The best medical reference that we have at this point, since 5G Syndrome is still a relatively new medical phenomenon, is another disease known variously EMF Hypersensitivity Illness and Electrohypersensitivity (EHS). What follows are just a few of the most common symptoms that are frequently experienced by people who know they have EHS. (Also, see the preceding diagram.) Nausea, headaches and migraines Ringing in the ears Numbness in the face or other body parts Dry eyes and sight problems Inability to concentrate and unexplained fatigue Depression Tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmia Hyperactivity and insomnia Redness and rashes Dryness in the throat and mouth Swollen sinuses and symptoms rhinitis (Source: Electrohypersensitivity: What you need to know about the allergy of the 21st century) There are several other symptoms that are also being recognized as the direct result of intensive EMF and microwave exposures. As follows: Headaches, migraines Chronic exhaustion Inner agitation Sleeplessness, daytime sleepiness Tinnitus Susceptibility to infection Nervous and connective tissue pains, for which the usual causes do not explain even the most conspicuous symptoms. (Source: Electrohypersensitivity: What you need to know about the allergy of the 21st century) KEY POINT: It’s essential to correctly comprehend the difference between 5G Syndrome and 5G flu. While there are several similarities, it’s the differences that really matter. Hence, every smartphone user and IoT enthusiast is compelled to contemplate any new health conditions or unusual symptoms or inexplicable sickness, particularly those that have been chronic and/or long term. See: CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL REPORT: Worldwide Outbreaks of 5G Syndrome and 5G Flu Driving Pandemic Conclusion The Wuhan coronavirus pandemic has awakened many to the reality of 5G Syndrome. Perhaps it took all of humanity to get freaked out by a scary frankenvirus — COVID-19 — in order to wake up to this extreme and growing danger in our midst—5G technology and the slowly emerging IoT. With this crucial understanding, at least now we know what we’re really dealing with. So, the best thing informed people can do is pass the word around: It’s really 5G and your smartphone that is causing the current pandemic, not necessarily the coronavirus or even any of the many other flu bugs circulating around the planet in 2020. Now many folks will naturally get a bad case of one of the many types of influenzas, or even the coronavirus itself, and they will need to take that illness/disease very seriously. If they are elderly or infirm or suffer from other illnesses, they especially need to follow the best advice out there. For the sake of prevention, there is this sage advice: Here’s How Everyone Can Avoid Getting The Coronavirus. For other alternative treatments and holistic approaches, excellent guidance such as this can be followed: Natural Protection Strategy Against Viruses, Including the Coronavirus Lastly, it’s important to note that the 5G Syndrome angle presented here is only one of several perspectives concerning what is really an ongoing series of bioterrorist attacks being carried out in 5G-intensive zones. The perpetrators are continuing the bio-attacks wherever they must cover up an epidemic of 5G syndrome so that the worldwide military deployment of 5G is not jeopardized by disclosures about the extremely serious health dangers and safety hazards. Do you see how they do it?! The NWO globalists are very clever, aren’t they? State of the Nation March 1, 2020 Author’s Note This “CORONAVIRUS HOAX” does not mean there is not a highly contagious bioengineered coronavirus that is being released as a bioweapon in the nations that have experienced the ongoing bioterrorists attacks. It means that these stealthy bio-attacks were meant to cover up the raging epidemics of 5G Syndrome in those specific locations. So, the coronavirus is quite real just as SARS and MERS, Bird Flu and Swine Flu were real. But, the Wuhan coronavirus was specifically bioengineered in order to create and hype a global pandemic around COVID-19. Again, the hoax aspect does not refer to a non-existent coronavirus; that frankenvirus is quite real indeed and being cunningly used as a decoy.

In May 2020, a video started to circulate online that supposedly showed an Italian politician calling for the arrest of Bill Gates, the former Microsoft CEO who has been at the center of several conspiracy theories due to his foundation’s work to develop a vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. This video was frequently shared on social media with the caption, “Italian Government call for arrest of Bill Gates”: This is a genuine video of an Italian politician calling for Gates’ arrest. However, a single politician’s opinion does not equate to the entire Italian government calling for action. In fact, this view has been condemned by Italian government officials (you can hear this politician being told “enough” and to be quiet during the video). The politician in this video is Italian Parliament Member Sara Cunial. She’s part of Italy’s “5 Star Movement,” a political party that has been blamed for a rise of measles in Italy after pushing an anti-vaccination agenda. Cunial, who was briefly suspended from the party in 2018 after likening vaccines to “free genocide” in a Facebook post, was fined in April 2020 for violating one of the country’s shelter-in place policies to visit a beach. (Cunial claims she was never fined.) Cunial’s speech before the Italian Parliament hit on a number of popular (and discredited) conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19. For instance, she linked the spread of the disease to the rise of 5G technology, claimed that Gates was working to de-populate the world, and said that the “ID2020” coalition was working to secretly implement digital microchips via mandatory vaccines. Cunial also fabricated a quote from Gates. After claiming that this was an “exact quote” from a Gates’ speech, Cunial falsely said that the former Microsoft CEO once stated, “If we do a good job on vaccines, health and reproduction, we can reduce the world population by 10-15%. Only a genocide can save the world.” Not only is this a fabricated quote, it illustrates a common misconception about Gates’ work related to global population. The former Microsoft CEO is working to lower child mortality, improve the health of poorer populations, and give people better access to contraceptives. In other words, Gates is not trying to use vaccines to kill children. Rather, he is hoping that a lower child mortality rate and better supportive programs will reduce the need for parents to have more children. Gates articulated his goals in a 2009 letter from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: A surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the number of deaths actually reduces population growth. […] Contrary to the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children. Not only was Cunial’s speech littered with conspiracy theories, the politician also blamed Italy’s leadership for allowing dogmatic scientism to become the “true cultural epidemic” of this country. This comment created some blowback (Cunial curiously claimed that she was not referring to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte) and some politicians urged her to apologize for the remark. Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies Mara Carfagna wrote on Twitter: “Connecting phantom plots to the Head of State is unworthy of an institutional representative.” Sostenere teorie assurde e infondate a @Montecitorio è grave, soprattutto in una emergenza sanitaria. Collegare fantomatici complotti al Capo dello Stato è indegno di un rappresentante istituzionale. Il Presidente Mattarella è un solido presidio di libertà e democrazia.#Cunial — Mara Carfagna (@mara_carfagna) May 14, 2020 In sum, it is true that an Italian politician spouted a number of conspiracy theories and called for the arrest of Gates during an address to Parliament. However, this viewpoint was not widely endorsed by the Italian government.', 'label': 1, 'dataset': 'mmcovid_en', 'distance': 0.0}, {'text': 'By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor These are external links and will open in a new window These are external links and will open in a new window Image copyright Getty Images The UK\\'s mobile networks have reported a further 20 cases of phone masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend. Trade group Mobile UK said it had been notified of incidents in England, Wales and Scotland. One of the targeted sites provides mobile connectivity to a hospital in Birmingham. The figure represents a lower incidence rate than had been the case the previous weekend. Mobile UK added it had received no reports of staff being targeted over the period. Attacks on 5G masts pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. But there are concerns a surge in the amount of vandalism has been caused by conspiracy theories, which falsely claim the deployment of 5G networks has caused or helped accelerate the spread of Covid-19. \"Theories being spread about 5G are baseless and are not grounded in credible scientific theory,\" said a spokesman for Mobile UK. \"Mobile operators are dedicated to keeping the UK connected, and careless talk could cause untold damage. \"Continuing attacks on mobile infrastructure risk lives and, at this challenging time, the UK\\'s critical sectors must be able to focus all their efforts on fighting this pandemic.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Vodafone said one of the masts attacked was used by patients and staff at a hospital in Birmingham The chief executive of Vodafone UK added that one of the targeted sites serves Birmingham\\'s Nightingale hospital. \"It\\'s heart-rending enough that families cannot be there at the bedside of loved ones who are critically ill,\" wrote Nick Jeffrey on LinkedIn \"It\\'s even more upsetting that even the small solace of a phone or video call may now be denied them because of the selfish actions of a few deluded conspiracy theorists. \"Imagine if it were your mum or dad, your gran or grandad in hospital.

But this morning, he clarified his position saying: \"There is no connection between the present national health emergency and 5G, and to suggest otherwise would be wrong and indeed it could be dangerous.\" Fresh attacks There have also been reports of potential cases since the Easter break. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of arson after a phone mast was on fire in Dagenham, Essex. The Met police told the Barking and Dagenham Post : \"Some evacuations were carried out as a precaution, but residents have since been allowed to return to their homes. There are no reports of any injuries.\" Police in Huddersfield have also said they are trying to determine exactly how a phone mast came to be on fire in the early hours of this morning. The fire destroyed communications equipment used by the emergency services as well as three mobile phone network providers, the local fire service said. Recent attacks on telecoms infrastructure have not been limited to the UK. On Saturday, the newspaper De Telegraaf reported there had been four incidents in the Netherlands over the previous week. It said in one case, arsonists had left an anti-5G slogan painted on the damaged equipment. There have also been reports of a suspected case in Ireland , where two masts caught fire on Sunday. Network provider Eir said the affected infrastructure was not being used for 5G, but was being upgraded to boost 4G coverage for a nearby hospital and the surrounding area. Unfounded theories Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Image copyright Reuters Image caption There have dozens of reported attacks on telecoms equipment over the past weeks One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network\\'s radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it\\'s important to recognise that the waveband involved is still \"non-ionising\", meaning it lacks enough energy to break apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea and well outside mainstream scientific thought . In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacteria. There\\'s another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.', 'label': 1, 'dataset': 'mmcovid_en', 'distance': 0.0}, {'text': 'Deep Tech is a new subscriber-only podcast that brings alive the people and ideas our editors and reporters are thinking about. Episodes are released every two weeks. We’re making this episode—like much of the rest of our coronavirus coverage—free to everyone. When it comes to the latest technologies for testing, treating, and preventing the spread of covid-19, there’s no one on MIT Technology Review’s staff who’s better connected and better informed than Antonio Regalado, the magazine’s senior biomedicine editor. Since February, he’s been self-isolating with his family at their farm house in Maine, while continuing to report on the pandemic. We talked with Antonio about why it’s taking so long to scale up coronavirus testing, what new vaccine technologies look most promising, and why he started prepping for the worst way back in January.

The breakthrough might happen, but it might not. Wade Roush: To get the coronavirus pandemic under control, government officials say we’ll need brand-new technologies for testing that allow us to diagnose more people, faster. But Antonio Regalado, Technology Review’s biomedicine editor, thinks that’s a lot of eggs to put in one basket. Antonio Regalado: I mean, a breakthrough is something that happens or it doesn\\'t. I mean, it\\'s hard to predict ahead of time. What we want is a technology where there\\'s a clear path and it\\'s a matter of doing it and a matter of overcoming obstacles. Wade Roush: We’ll talk about why the effort to scale up coronavirus testing is going so slowly here in the US, and which technologies do have the best chance of working—both for diagnostic testing and, eventually, for making a vaccine against the virus. I’m Wade Roush, and this is Deep Tech. [Deep Tech theme] Wade Roush: Recently the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Deborah Birx, went on Meet the Press and told NBC’s Chuck Todd that one key to ending the coronavirus lockdown and letting states restart their economies will be developing a new way to test whether people are infected. Deborah Birx: We have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing. We have to be able to detect antigen, rather than constantly trying to detect the actual live virus or viral particles itself, and to really move into antigen testing. And I know corporations in diagnostics are working on that now. We have to have a breakthrough. This RNA testing will carry us certainly through the spring and summer, but we need to have a huge technology breakthrough and we’re working on that at the same time. Wade Roush: Here at Technology Review, we’re all about covering breakthroughs. Which is why we know you can’t just snap your fingers and make one happen. Antonio Regalado covers the latest advances in biomedical research, and he’s been reporting for months on all aspects of the coronavirus response, from testing to antiviral drugs to novel types of vaccines. So I knew he’d have some thoughts about Dr. Birx’s pronouncement—and that he’d be able to tell us how close we really are to having a simple at-home antigen test that could substitute for the slow and complicated genetic testing that’s currently our main way to check for the virus. I reached Antonio at his farm house in Maine. But before we even talked about the science, I wanted to know why he started getting ready for a crisis way back in January, before the rest of us were even paying attention to this new coronavirus. Wade Roush: It didn\\'t really take you long to start preparing for the coronavirus pandemic in a way that might have seemed extreme to the rest of us at that time. So how and when did you realize that this was going to be probably the most dramatic, most impactful pandemic of our lifetimes? Antonio Regalado: When I first heard about the Wuhan virus—I guess as Trump calls it, we’re not supposed to call it that, at the time, though, in January, it was definitely the virus in Wuhan, far away—it looked basically exactly like SARS. And so just personally, I said, well, you know, I spent a year working on SARS and then SARS went away. And so my decision early on was that. I was going to ignore this virus. And I would leave it to public health reporters to cover it. Antonio Regalado: So that was early or middle of January. By the end of January, I had spoken to a venture capitalist named Robert Nelson. He\\'s a partner at Arch Venture Partners, a kind of influential biotech investor. And his Twitter feed had turned quite alarming. Like, he was clearly very alarmed by this virus. So I called him up and I asked him to tell me, you know, what was going through his head. And he was very, very concerned that this was what he called sort of a global train wreck in slow motion. Within a couple of days of speaking to Robert Nelson, I sent my wife the following e-mail. and I\\'ll read it to you. On January 28, 2020. Antonio Regalado wrote to his wife under the subject line, Pandemic Shopping List, \"Please obtain: three bottles of bleach, several milks in box, the European kind you can keep at room temperature. Large bags of: carrots, onions, potatoes, beans and rice.\" Antonio Regalado: So on January 28, my paranoia was high and by then, I was trying to prepare by acquiring the supplies that I would need to weather the pandemic. But it wasn\\'t until a month later that I actually wrote a story that we published in Technology Review about prepping, just for the reason that you mentioned. It seems like a crazy, paranoid thing to do when the virus is far away. In fact, my wife, I have her reply. She replied to me, “Really? Why? Is one coming?,” she said of the pandemic. And I said, back to her, “Well, there is one in China.” Wade Roush: Yeah. Well, in retrospect, the idea of laying in weeks\\' worth of supplies, just in case you weren\\'t able to go back to the store to get groceries, that seems really smart. And I\\'m just curious about whether in your mind, there\\'s still a line between rational prepping and survivalist Montana mountain man prepping. Do you know what I\\'m getting at? Antonio Regalado: I do. I do. Let\\'s face it, prepping is anti-social. It is anti-social to acquire a bunch of supplies for your personal use, then lock the doors of your cabin. I don\\'t really have much insight into the hardcore preppers, you know, people who have weapons and stuff and a bunker underground. I mean, clearly in a certain community of people close to technology, when they were worried about the virus, when they started prepping, has now become sort of a badge of honor. And they make noise of it. I would say in my case as a journalist, it was more an attempt to be close to the story and be part of the story. If other people are prepping and I\\'m going to write about it, then I wanted to prep, too. Wade Roush: But you\\'re glad to have the extra bottles of bleach and the extra cans of beans. Antonio Regalado: I have a hundred pounds of flour. Other people can\\'t get flour. And I\\'m trying to think about how I can participate, other than through the journalism. Should I stop doing journalism and become a contact tracer? Should I give away half my flour to somebody else who needs it? These are the questions of the day. Wade Roush: Let\\'s talk next about testing. So we know that one key to eventually scaling back self-isolation and quarantining and social distancing will be massively expanding the number of people who can get tested for the coronavirus up to the point where ideally you can test millions of people per day. But the dominant technology that\\'s being used for that right now is something called PCR or RT-PCR. And it\\'s apparently really difficult to scale up, because we\\'re not doing very well at it. So could you explain for us what RT-PCR is, and why the expansion of that kind of testing is still taking so long? Antonio Regalado: Yeah. Well, when these testing problems first started to arise and be reported, it was mind-boggling to me, because PCR, polymerase chain reaction, is not a new technology. It was developed in the ’80s. And it\\'s something that every single graduate student in a biology lab knows how to do. So I was kind of astonished that there was a discussion going on about PCR. You know, how is it that people have forgotten how to do this bread and butter activity? And why is it that the ability to do this test is somehow contingent on some kind of government approval or government supplies? So all that was very strange to me, because PCR is so fundamental to genetic research. Antonio Regalado: What it does is basically just amplify DNA. You have a little bit of DNA and PCR is what you use to multiply it into lots of DNA that you can then easily measure. So it turns out, though, that the whole sort of infrastructure for doing PCR testing is more fragile than we knew, and harder scale up than we would have thought. And that is because initially some of the chemicals that were used to kind of guide the PCR reaction were flawed. They didn\\'t work correctly. Then suddenly there was a shortage of those pieces. They\\'re called primers. That was resolved. But then there was a shortage of something that else that you needed, another chemical to basically turn the virus\\'s RNA into DNA. It\\'s called reverse transcriptase. There was a suddenly a shortage of that. Antonio Regalado: So you can think about it as cooking. You know, for cooking, you need flour and you need sugar and you need a bowl and you need a mixing spoon and you need all these things. And so what happened with the testing is, there was a crisis in the supply of every one of those things that happened at different times. So everybody wanted to cook brownies at exactly the same time. And that was the problem with scaling up. There just wasn\\'t enough of all these different materials. But the process itself, apparently, is a little bit hard to scale up to millions or tens of millions just using PCR. So people are looking at different technologies that might be more amenable to sort of massive-scale testing. Wade Roush: So Deborah Birx, who\\'s the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, has started talking about antigen testing, which is an approach that wouldn\\'t rely on PCR, as I understand it. That\\'s one of the new forms of testing that could perhaps come to the rescue, but I imagine it has its own scaling issues. Antonio Regalado: Getting to this question of how to scale up testing in a massive way, there\\'s sort of two general categories of where new technology can help. One is massive centralized testing. And the second is massive decentralized testing. So let me just talk about the centralized testing first. Right now, the PCR testing is centralized. The samples are sent to clinical laboratories, public health laboratories, commercial companies like LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics that have centers, facilities that do the testing. And that accounts for the delay. Like people are having long delays in getting their test results, four or five days. Antonio Regalado: So there are ideas that are coming out of the genome centers like the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, out of UCLA, out of Berkeley. And these are schemes for doing massive testing by using the genome sequencing machines that are normally used to sequence human genomes. And so what people have come up with are schemes by which thousands, tens of thousands, even millions of samples, say, from all over the country could be pooled together and then read out on these speedy sequencing machines. Antonio Regalado: So that\\'s one idea people have. But it\\'s still, even though they believe that it could get to the scale of millions, there are a couple of problems with it. One problem is just the logistics, like how do you get all those swabs into one place? And the other thing is that it\\'s still not in real time. This massive centralized testing, there\\'s still delay. You’ve got to collect the swabs. You got to send them somewhere, and then you have to get the results and you have to report the results back. So it\\'s still a delay. Antonio Regalado: The other category of test, which relates to Deborah Birx\\'s comment, is massive decentralized testing. What happens if there was a test that everybody could use from home before you go to work? After you go to work? Once a week, twice a week, you could test yourself, and have an idea whether you were infected and if you were, then you could, you would know what to do. You\\'d have to stay home, get in touch with public health authorities, call your contacts and let them know that you have this virus. So there\\'s different ways in theory to do this at home testing. Deborah Birx is talking about an antigen test. An antigen test is when you have an antibody that sticks to the virus. It\\'s in a little tiny test kit. You\\'re looking for this spike protein on the surface of the virus or maybe some other thing that is actually on the virus poking out of it. The way I understand it is you have a test strip with antibodies and that that is going to stick to that antigen if it is in your nasal swab. But there\\'s some questions about whether an antigen test is actually going to work. The problem with antigen tests is that they have not worked well for respiratory viruses. Wade Roush: Antonio says that there’s a potential middle ground here. It’s the idea of a simplified genetic test that would combine the accuracy of PCR-based testing with the convenience of decentralized at-home testing. Antonio Regalado: Who\\'s working on at-home genetic tests? Well, some of the molecular biologists who were working on the sort of large-scale schemes are also working on the chemistry for an at home test. One of them is Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. And he works with this technology CRISPR, which is known for gene editing. But it turns out you can adapt it also to make a simplified genetic test format. So they\\'re trying to figure out, can they make it even simpler and can they package it up in a way that would make it the basis for an at home genetic test? Another person working on it is a well-known entrepreneur named Jonathan Rothberg. He’s quite a character. He\\'s in quarantine on his super-yacht, the Gene Machine. But he\\'s also someone with a ton of resources which he has been marshalling to try and create an at-home genetic test. And they actually have prototypes that they\\'re testing at Yale on real patient samples. And they are working on developing a little device, which would sort of automatically mix the samples, it’s about the size of a credit card. And the idea is that this would be a genetic test that you could do at home. And it turns out that the chemistry is not necessarily the hardest part. There’s all these other practical elements. Wade Roush: If we\\'re gonna have a huge breakthrough, do you think it\\'s going to come from the bottom up, or are there any signs of any sort of top-down leadership on this? Antonio Regalado: I don’t know what Deborah Birx meant by a breakthrough, but from what I know of emerging technology, we shouldn\\'t be counting on breakthroughs, right? I mean, breakthrough is something that happens or it doesn\\'t. You know, it\\'s hard to predict ahead of time. What we want is a technology where there\\'s a clear path and it\\'s a matter of doing it, and a matter of overcoming obstacles. Antonio Regalado: Sri Kosuri is a researcher at UCLA who I spoke with. And he\\'s working on a procedure by which tens of thousands of patient samples could be pooled together and then run on a sequencing machine. So he came up with this concept and I just asked him, well, who\\'s gonna do this? Are you going to do this? Who\\'s gonna do this? And he said that the problem was that kind of everybody is waiting for somebody else to take the action. The people who can solve the logistics, they don\\'t necessarily believe that the technologists can do this massive testing, whereas the academics, they\\'re not in a position to do the logistics of collecting the samples. So there\\'s this kind of game of a chicken and egg is as he described it. Antonio Regalado: I think that certain locations like Boston or San Francisco, where they have this concentration of academic medical centers and researchers, they\\'re going to take the lead. And I think pretty soon we\\'ll see a new testing scheme arise in those areas. And once they do that, other people will follow suit. Wade Roush: Great. OK. So, Antonio, let\\'s finish up by talking about the perhaps the biggest tool of all for ending this pandemic, and that\\'s vaccines. To your mind, what are some of the most interesting and provocative approaches that people are exploring right now to developing a vaccine against the coronavirus? Antonio Regalado: Yeah, well, actually, the vaccine efforts got underway very quickly, unlike the testing. As soon as that sequence of the coronavirus became available, the people working on vaccines immediately grabbed it and started work. The sequence of the virus is the essential starting point for the vaccine, and in fact, the first vaccine to reach clinical trials, I think they began in late February or early March, is one from a Boston-area biotech called Moderna Pharmaceuticals. And they have a new approach to making vaccines, in which they basically take the genetic code, a snippet of the genetic code from the virus, stick it inside a nanoparticle like a little ball of fat, and they inject that into people. So the goal is that your own cells will take that information and start making this little bit of the virus. Your body will react to it and you\\'ll become immunized. Antonio Regalado: And what\\'s interesting about Moderna’s approach is just the speed with which they were able to go from the sequence of the virus to their candidate drug or their candidate vaccine. It only took them a couple of months. So early on in the pandemic, we already had, you know, a new benchmark that was set for how fast a vaccine candidate could be prepared. Of course, it doesn\\'t mean theirs will work. In fact, there\\'s no vaccine of that type that\\'s widely used or licensed. So we may end up looking instead to more conventional types of vaccines, of which there\\'s a number of strategies to make them. And I looked at the World Health Organization, and I think that they count something like 50 or so different vaccine efforts. So there\\'s a huge number of vaccines in development, each using a sort of slightly different technology. Wade Roush: Ok, so one virtue of these new innovative approaches, like Moderna\\'s, is they might be faster to implement. But do they also have the downside that they\\'re just so new that we\\'re not sure exactly how they\\'re going to work in the body yet, and they have to go through like an equally lengthy testing period to make sure they are safe? Antonio Regalado: Correct. And this gets back to the point of, you know, waiting for a breakthrough. This is not the time to count on a breakthrough. The breakthrough might happen, but it might not. So, you know, at different extremes is the Moderna vaccine, which is used as a very clever idea. It\\'s very fast to get started. But there\\'s no existing vaccine that\\'s widely used that’s based on this technology. So it\\'s simply unproven whether it makes an effective vaccine that could be manufactured at large scale. We just don\\'t know that. At the other extreme or companies like Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, and others who are using what they call vaccine platforms that have a history of success. There\\'s actually vaccines that are out there that are made using these approaches. They take a little bit longer, or quite a lot longer, but they may in the end be the better bet. We just don\\'t know. So I think a lot of people are saying, well, we need to bet and bet big on all the approaches. Wade Roush: Ok, Antonio, thank you so much for sharing all this today. And stay safe up there in Maine. Antonio Regalado: Great. Thank you, Wade.

As the world begins to emerge from the pandemic, China is first to emerge from covid-19 imposed lockdowns thanks to cutting-edge technology, with autonomous vehicles and smart cities seeing an acceleration during this time. In China, new opportunities for the autonomous driving industry and intelligent solutions have stood out. Restrictions on retail, dining, and everyday life during the outbreak have increased demand for driverless deliveries and non-contact operations, both heavily relying on autonomous driving technologies. How autonomous vehicles are being leveraged to fight the pandemic As the outbreak progresses, all sectors of Chinese society continue to apply AI, big data capabilities, and robot services to prevent and control the coronavirus. Autonomous driving has also proved to be essential in the fight against the pandemic, easing the burden of covid-19 by transporting necessary medical supplies and food to health-care professionals and the public in infected areas and disinfecting hospitals and public surfaces to reduce the spread of coronavirus. “Having been through the pandemic and supported the front line, we realize ‘automation’ and ‘intelligence’ are the best solutions for humans to respond to large-scale emergencies,” said Zhenyu Li, corporate vice president and general manager of the Baidu Intelligent Driving Group. Baidu, one of the leaders in autonomous vehicle technology, has released 104 driverless vehicles in 17 cities across the country. These autonomous vehicles are helping carry out frontline anti-epidemic work such as cleaning, disinfecting, logistics, and transportation with support from partner companies. Apollo, Baidu’s autonomous vehicle platform, partnered with Neolix, a local self-driving startup, to deliver food and supplies to the Beijing Haidian Hospital. Together, Apollo and Neolix provided daily food deliveries that help feed over 100 frontline staff members who were treating a growing patient base. Additionally, Apollo and Neolix deployed unmanned vehicles daily to disinfect all roads on Shanghai Zhangjiang Artificial Intelligence Island. These unmanned vehicles can carry out a full range of disinfectant operations and cover the entire surface of a road. When the vehicle’s self-propelled spray disinfection mode is activated, it can fully cover the island's roads in about half an hour, three times a day. The vehicle’s trolley can be loaded with 160 liters of disinfectant. Simultaneously, the vehicle can serve as a night-time security robot and create alerts about those who are disregarding the coronavirus prevention guidelines, such as not wearing masks or gathering in large crowds. Apollo also partnered with iDriverPlus to provide autonomous vehicles to 16 hospitals for covid-19 treatments nationwide. Each hospital is being supported with one or two disinfectant and delivery vehicles, aiming to minimize person-to-person transmission and alleviate the shortage of medical staff. Driverless cleaning and disinfection vehicles are operating in the Huashan Hospital, affiliated with the Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, and The Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital of Fudan University. These initiatives are being provided for free until the pandemic subsides. Baidu’s Apollo has also made its low-speed driverless micro-car kits and autonomous driving cloud services available at no charge to companies that are dedicated to fighting covid-19. While Apollo’s autonomous vehicles have not focused on transporting passengers during the outbreak, Baidu is accelerating its plans to fuse its technology into people’s everyday lives. Starting on April 19, 2020, the company opened the Baidu Apollo Robotaxi service in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan Province. Robotaxis provide free rides to passengers across an area of 130 square kilometers. The services cover residential and commercial leisure areas, as well as industrial parks. V2X is driving the development of autonomous vehicles Since early 2020, the challenges of the pandemic have stimulated digital transformation and development in China. The country is aiming to push “new infrastructure,” a new technology-driven structural upgrade of the economy, by further developing 5G networks, constructing more data centers across the nation, and revamping local city management systems with emerging technologies. An instrumental component of China’s development of smart cities is Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), a comprehensive technology that enables vehicles to communicate with the environment, aiming to make autonomous vehicles safer, smarter, more economical, and convenient. “Along with the continuous intelligence development of an individual autonomous vehicle, V2X will reduce the high cost of autonomous vehicles and provide more guaranteed safety through redundancy,” said Li. Over the past three months, Baidu Apollo has won bids to build V2X pilot zones in Chongqing’s Yongchuan district, Shanxi province’s Yangquan city, and Anhui province’s Hefei city. A V2X pilot zone within 20 square kilometers of Yongchuan district in Chongqing, is testing level-4 autonomous vehicles, which can drive almost all the time without human control. It is also collaborating with Baidu on the development of a 3,000 square meter intelligent network hub in Yongchuan’s Big Data Industrial Park for research on testing technologies and standards. In addition, Yangquan City is constructing a 10-kilometer test and demonstration zone for V2X, where Apollo will update its roadside systems by deploying sensors, transmission, edge computing servers, and signal collections systems, controlled and viewed by a Baidu public cloud-based control platform and vehicle monitoring platform. As a result of these advances, Baidu has become integral to the development and transition toward smart cities. Recently, Baidu Apollo released the ACE Transportation Engine (Autonomous driving, Connected road, Efficient mobility), a full-stack solution helping cities build intelligent transportation systems. The ACE Transportation Engine integrates AI with infrastructure, equipment, services, and industry governance. It also provides transportation systems with real-time insights, instantaneous responses and intelligent decision-making capabilities. The ACE Transportation Engine is creating a dynamic intelligent vehicle innovation ecosystem and a modern transportation system that delivers safety, convenience, efficiency, environmental protection and cost-effectiveness. More than 10 cities in China have implemented the engine. Prior to covid-19, autonomous vehicles were not as widely used in China as they are today. Unmanned vehicles were limited by technical capabilities. The pandemic awakened a need for autonomous vehicles to improve safety, deliver supplies and advance new infrastructures. Throughout the country, hospitals and cities are using autonomous vehicles to help control and decrease the spread of the coronavirus. Baidu is supporting technologies to help transform and create a new future through autonomous vehicles. Covid-19 is accelerating the development of autonomous vehicles and smart cities in China, leading to new breakthroughs and expansion which will minimize the impact of the pandemic and create a new infrastructure to enable better future outcomes. For countries around the world, the developments in China can be used to drive better outcomes for themselves as the world looks to end the covid-19 pandemic as quickly as possible.\", 'label': 0, 'dataset': 'mmcovid_en', 'distance': 0.0}, {'text': 'This article is republished here with permission from The Conversation.

In times of crisis, conspiracy theories can spread as fast as a virus. As the coronavirus pandemic tightened its grip on a world which struggled to comprehend the enormity of the situation it was facing, darker forces were concocting their own narratives. Scientists and researchers were working – and continue to work – around the clock for answers. But science is slow and methodical. So far-fetched explanations about how the outbreak started began filling the vacuum. Among these strange explanations is a theory that the recent rollout of 5G technology is to blame. But where did this theory begin, how did it develop and mutate and what can be done to stem the tide of fake news? We asked four experts who have all done extensive research in this area to examine these questions. Marc Tuters, assistant professor of new media and digital culture at the University of Amsterdam, and Peter Knight, professor of American studies at the University of Manchester, examine the big questions and the history of conspiracy theories. Then Wasim Ahmed, lecturer in digital business at Newcastle University, and Joesph Downing, a nationalism research fellow at the London School of Economics, share the results of their new study into the origins of the 5G conspiracy theory on social media. A toxic cocktail of misinformation Marc Tuters and Peter Knight Conspiracy theories about mobile phone technology have been circulating since the 1990s, and have long historical roots. Doctors first talked of “radiophobia” as early as 1903. Following on from fears about power lines and microwaves in the 1970s, opponents of 2G technology in the 1990s suggested that radiation from mobile phones could cause cancer, and that this information was being covered up. Other conspiracy theories about 5G include the idea that it was responsible for the unexplained deaths of birds and trees. The coronavirus 5G conspiracy theory comes in several different strains, of varying degrees of implausibility. One of the first versions of the theory claimed that it was no coincidence that 5G technology was trialled in Wuhan, where the pandemic began (this is incorrect, as 5G was already being rolled out in number of locations). Some claim that the coronavirus crisis was deliberately created in order to keep people at home while 5G engineers install the technology everywhere. Others insist that 5G radiation weakens people’s immune systems, making them more vulnerable to infection by COVID-19. Another mutation of the 5G conspiracy theory asserts that 5G directly transmits the virus. These different 5G stories are often combined together with other COVID-19 conspiracy theories into a toxic cocktail of misinformation. At first, some conspiracy theorists insisted that the threat of the virus (and the apparent death rates) had been exaggerated. Echoing President Donald Trump’s own language, some of his supporters considered this as part of an elaborate “hoax” intended to harm his chances of re-election. Others, particularly on the far right in the US, framed lockdown emergency measures in terms of “Deep State” efforts at controlling the population and called for a “second civil war” in response. Other prominent theories include the claim that the virus was accidentally released by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or that it was deliberately made as a biowarfare weapon, either by the Chinese or the Americans. One increasingly popular idea is that the pandemic is part of a plan by global elites like Bill Gates or George Soros – in league with Big Pharma – to institute mandatory worldwide vaccinations that would include tracking chips, which would then be activated by 5G radiowaves. Polling data in various countries including the UK, the US, France, Austria and Germany has shown that the most popular coronavirus conspiracy theory is that the virus was man-made – 62% of respondents in the UK think that this theory is true to some degree. In that UK poll, 21% agreed, to varying extents, that coronavirus is caused by 5G and is a form of radiation poisoning transmitted through radiowaves. In comparison, 19% agreed that Jews have created the virus to collapse the economy for financial gain. Where did these theories come from? Few of these theories are new. Most of them are mutations or re-combinations of existing themes, often drawing on narrative tropes and rhetorical manoeuvres that have a long history. Conspiracy theorists usually have a complete worldview, through which they interpret new information and events, to fit their existing theory. Indeed, one of the defining characteristics of conspiracy thinking is that it is self-sealing, unfalsifiable and resistant to challenge. The absence of evidence is, ironically, often taken as evidence of a massive cover up. The dismissal of the pandemic as a hoax and the questioning of scientific experts is straight out of the playbook of climate change denial. The 5G theory about radiowaves transmitting or activating the virus, for example, is a reworking of long running conspiracy fears about mind control experiments, subliminal messaging and supposed secret US military weapons projects (all ripe topics for Hollywood’s movie industry). The 5G story shares similarities with rumours that date back to the 1990s about HAARP (the US military’s High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program). HAARP was a large radio transmitter array located in Alaska and funded by the US Department of Defence, in conjunction with a number of research universities. The programme conducted experiments into the ionosphere (the upper layer of the atmosphere) using radio waves, and was closed down in 2014. Conspiracy theorists, however, claimed that it was actually developing a weapon for weather control as well as mind control. Similarly, concerns have been expressed concerning that 5G might be in fact be a hi-tech weapon whose use represents an “existential threat to humanity”. There have also long been conspiracy rumours that Big Pharma is suppressing a cure for cancer. The idea that the virus was made in a lab mirrors claims made a quarter of a century ago about HIV/AIDS. One origin for that story was an early example of a KGB disinformation campaign. The allegation that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or George Soros planned the coronavirus pandemic is a version of familiar right-wing (and often racist and antisemitic) conspiracy fantasies about “globalist” elites threatening national and individual sovereignty. There is mounting evidence that far-right groups are opportunistically using fear and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic to promote their hateful politics. Populist conspiracy theories often work by dividing the world into Us vs Them, with the aim of scapegoating people and institutions and providing simple explanations for complex phenomena. The 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories are particularly challenging because they bring together people from very different parts of the political spectrum. On the one hand, they attract the far-right who see them as part of a technological assault by big government on the freedom of individuals. On the other, they appeal to the well established anti-vaxxer community, who are often allied with those distrustful of Big Pharma. In the US, which is in an election year, coronavirus mitigation strategies have become a divisive culture war issue, with the president refusing to wear a face mask. But in countries like Germany anti-lockdown issues appear to be creating connections across the political spectrum, led by social media influencers who are working to connect the dots between previously separate conspiracy theory communities or tribes. A misbegotten, warped freedom obsession is killing us. pic.twitter.com/KbYaTVtR0O — Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) May 22, 2020 As seen in the quantitative analysis below, such influencers anchor conspiracy theory communities on social media. Because these methods provide only a partial view, it is problematic to assume that the members of these communities are necessarily trapped within echo chambers, unable to access other points of view. Nevertheless the findings do correspond with the troubling patterns outlined above. And they also show that those who believe in and propagate conspiracy theories can come from a cross section of society. Social network analysis Wasim Ahmed and Joseph Downing Our study set out to investigate the 5G conspiracy theory on Twitter towards the beginning of April 2020 which was when the conspiracy was trending in the UK and increasing its visibility. This time period coincided with reports that at least 20 UK 5G phone masts were vandalised, including damage reported at a hospital. There were also 5G arson attacks across continental Europe during this time. Our research set out to uncover who was spreading the conspiracy theory, the percentage of users who believed the theory and what steps were needed to combat it. We used a tool called NodeXL to carry out a social network analysis. NodeXL is a Microsoft Excel plugin which can be used to retrieve data from a number of social media platforms such as Twitter. We captured data using the “5Gcoronavirus” keyword which also retrieved tweets with the #5GCoronavirus hashtag. Tweets we analysed were posted from March 27 to April 4. The network consisted of a total of 10,140 tweets, which are composed of 1,938 mentions, 4,003 retweets, 759 mentions in retweets, 1,110 replies, and 2,328 individual tweets. We found that there was a specific Twitter account, set up as @5gcoronavirus19 with 383 followers, which was spreading the conspiracy theory and had become influential in driving it forward on social media. The account was able to send out 303 tweets in seven days. We also found that President Trump was often tagged in tweets and was influential within the network without having tweeted himself. This highlights the point about support for these theories coming from the alt-right. Out of a total of 2,328 individual tweets, 34.8% of users believed the theory and/or shared views in support of it. For example, one user who we are not identifying due to the ethics on which our study was based tweeted: 5G Kills! #5Gcoronavirus – they are linked! People don’t be blind to the truth! But 32% denounced the theory or mocked it. For instance, one user noted: “5G is not harming or killing a single person! COVID-19 #5Gcoronavirus”. A further 33% were just general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Like one user who tweeted: “I have a 10AM Skype Chat on Monday, COVID-19 #5Gcoronavirus”. But this overt lack of support for the conspiracy itself became a problem because as more users joined the discussion, the profile of the topic was raised which allowed it to start trending. Network clusters  Author provided  We created a social network graph (above), clustering identified different shapes and structures within the network. The largest group in the network represented an “isolates group”. These groups are typically formed when a user mentions a hashtag in their tweets without mentioning another user. Big brands, sports events and breaking news stories will all have a sizeable isolates group. This suggests that during this time the conspiracy topic had become popular and attracted views and opinions from users who were new to the network. The second largest network shape resembled a “broadcast” network and contained users that were being retweeted. Broadcast networks can typically be found in the Twitter feeds of celebrities and journalists. The Twitter handle @5gcoronavirus19, which was set up to spread the theory, formed a group of its own resembling a broadcast network shape and it received a number of retweets, showing how the conspiracy theory was being amplified as users retweeted content. Conspiracy theorists are likely to use comments made by influential figures which can add fuel to the fire. A key example of this would be when the television presenter Eamon Holmes said the media couldn’t say for sure whether the 5G theory was false. These comments fell outside of the time period we studied. But they are likely to have had an impact across social media platforms. Holmes was strongly criticised by Ofcom which noted that his comments risked undermining the public’s faith in science. The misinformation pandemic Months before mobile phone masks were attacked in the UK, the “infodemic” (a wide and rapid spread of misinformation) was unfolding at a rapid pace. In France, news spread on Facebook of a tasty cure for the virus: Roquefort cheese. Indeed, a far more dangerous public health prospect than blue cheese, the rumour that cocaine could cure COVID-19 caused the French Ministry of Health to release a warning statement. #Coronavirus | Désinfox ❌ Non, La cocaïne NE protège PAS contre le #COVID19 . ✅ C’est une drogue addictive provoquant de graves effets indésirables et nocifs pour la santé des personnes. 👉 https://t.co/ajSGwecauL pic.twitter.com/4GZ01Qmg5X — Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé (@MinSoliSante) March 8, 2020 Some argue that strange events like this, which erupt from the online world of fake news, memes and misinformation, effectively delivered Trump the US presidency. Given that a survey showed 75% of Americans believed fake news during that election, this claim is not as outrageous as it initially sounds. But there is another theory. Rather than social media activity leading to direct “real world” action, the reverse could be true. For example, a major event like the Arab Spring was a real world action that caused a ripple effect across social media. Dark forces are still at work on the internet during major events. They seek to spread a fake news agenda and change the way events are perceived and constructed in dangerous ways. Our other research, carried out with Richard Dron from the University of Salford, examined the depictions of Muslims during the Grenfell fire and tracked how Grenfell was covered on Twitter as the fire still burned in the early hours of June 14, 2017. In the following days both celebrities and politicians would be reprimanded for spreading distrust about official accounts of the fire. A strong denunciation of the 5G and COVID-19 conspiracy from a world leader, when it surfaced, would have helped in mitigating the effect of the theory on the public. But during this time Boris Johnson, the UK’s prime minister, was himself sick with COVID-19. So was there was no direct rebuttal from him. Although this would have helped we believe the fight should ideally take place on the platform on which the conspiracy is shared. Our ongoing work on fitness influencers demonstrates how popular culture figures with large followings on Twitter and other social media platforms can sometimes have more of an appeal – and be more believable – than “official” accounts or politicians. That is why we believe that governments and health authorities should draw on social media influencers in order to counteract misinformation. It is also important to note which websites people were sharing around this time, as they are likely to play a key role in the spread and existence of the theory. Unsurprisingly, “fake news” websites such as InfoWars published a number of articles which indicated that there was a link between COVID-19 and 5G technologies. YouTube also appeared as an influential domain, as Twitter users linked to various videos which were spreading the theory. Worryingly, our study found that a small number of Twitter users were happy to see footage posted of 5G masts being damaged and hoped for more to be attacked. Twitter has been taking action and blocking users from sharing 5G conspiracy theories on the platform. YouTube has also been banning content that contains medical misinformation. It has not been easy for social media platforms to keep up as the pandemic has given rise over ten different conspiracy theories. One way the public can join the fight against conspiracy theories is to report inappropriate and/or dangerous content on social media platforms and – more importantly – avoid sharing or engaging with them. Meanwhile the mainstream media on public television, newspapers and radio should be doing its part by discussing and dispelling conspiracy theories as they arise. But social media platforms, citizens and governments need to work together with experts to regain trust and debunk the deluge of fake news and ever evolving theories. Mutations Marc Tuters and Peter Knight The viral conspiracy video, Plandemic is a key example as it has helped coronavirus conspiracy theories spread even more widely into the mainstream. The video – which briefly went viral on YouTube and Facebook until it was taken down – focused on a discredited virologist who promotes the theory that the coronavirus pandemic was a Big Pharma plot to sell vaccines. Although such conspiracy theories are less widespread than the torrent of coronavirus misinformation that is being catalogued and debunked by media watchdog groups, what is particularly concerning is how they are mutating and combining into novel and potentially dangerous forms as different tribes converge and encroach in the mainstream with slick videos involving “real” experts. With coronavirus, existing 5G conspiracy theories have indeed become supercharged, leading for instance to new protest movements such as the “hygiene protests” in Germany. In these protests, unfamiliar configurations of left and right-wing activists are finding common cause in their shared indignance towards lockdown protocols. In the past several years Deep State conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon first developed within reactionary “deep web” communities before spreading into the mainstream, where they were amplified by disinformation bots, social media influencers, celebrities, and politicians. Thriving communities have grown up around these theories, clustered around conspiracy theory entrepreneurs. A significant number of these figures, with some notable exceptions, have pivoted to interpret the coronavirus pandemic through their particular conspiratorial lens. With coronavirus as a common strand connecting these various tribes, the result has been a cross-fertilisation of ideas. Such hybridised conspiracy theories appear to be popping up across all points of the political spectrum and of the web, in contrast to previous cases when they emerged primarily from the margins and spread to the mainstream. In comparison with previous outbursts of fake news, social media platforms have responded quite proactively to the abundance of coronavirus-related problematic information. Google, for example, curates coronavirus-related search results, meaning that they only return authoritative sources and feature links to those sources where advertisements would usually have appeared. Platforms have also been much more willing to delete problematic trending content, as with the case of the Plandemic video which YouTube removed within 24 hours – although not before it had reached 2.5 million views. While this kind of banned content inevitably migrates to an “alternative social media ecology” of sites like Bitchute and Telegram, their much smaller audience share diminishes the reach of these conspiracy theories as well as undermining the revenue streams of their entrepreneurs. In an era in which public distrust of institutions and suspicion of elites is one of the contributing factors in the global rise of national populism, the communication of authoritative knowledge is undoubtedly a challenge for governments. In this time of enormous uncertainty, capable and honest leadership is one of the only truly effective measures which will help manage the spread of coronavirus misinformation and politicians should be putting party allegiances to one side while confronting the problem. For everyone else this means accepting that short term solutions are unlikely and that people should trust the experts, think before sharing social media content and care for one another.

As the coronavirus pandemic has gathered momentum, so too have explanations for how the outbreak started and what is causing its spread. Among these explanations is a theory that the recent rollout of 5G technology is to blame. Many countries are witnessing increased numbers of groups warning others about the dangers of 5G. In the UK, Australia and the US, activists believe that 5G is the real cause of the pandemic, and that disrupting the 5G network is necessary to halt the spread of the virus. At the extreme end of these groups are those who warn that COVID-19 is a hoax, a cover-story for more evil plans, of which 5G is a crucial part. Why do people believe conspiracy theories, and what accounts for the ongoing surge in their popularity? At the root of these beliefs is a contemporary spirit of distrust towards governments and health organisations. Moreover, people are particularly drawn to these alternative explanations during times of crisis. Truth seekers Many conspiracy theorists identify themselves as “truth seekers”. They are often part of a wider movement of people that consider themselves to be free thinkers who are courageous enough to seek the truth, and to speak up. They act like heroic detectives, revealing what they see as powerful groups operating in secrecy to achieve malevolent outcomes. Most conspiracy theories view these powerful groups as working in the shadows, inaccessible and behind the scenes. But the 5G-coronavirus theory departs from this template in one crucial way: the source of evil is visible and accessible to anyone who believes in these ideas. Unlike shadowy cabals and occult forces, the 5G-coronavirus conspiracy can be challenged directly. The 5G network is composed of material infrastructures that are easy to identify and access. For those who believe they know the truth, acts of vandalism against phone masts and antennas represent the possibility to exert some control over troubling events. Conspiracies at a time of crisis People want to simplify and make sense of complex and unprecedented situations. As a means to understand this pandemic, there exist both official and conspiracy theories. The official truth is simple: COVID-19 was transferred to humans from animals, similar to previous coronavirus outbreaks. It is primarily spread through droplets generated when an infected person sneezes or coughs. The popularity of theories that link 5G to the outbreak, however, expose the levels of distrust towards scientific claims, truth and expert explanations of events. Although anti-5G theories have been around for some time, these explanations are currently winning new supporters. This is in part due to a lack of confidence in governments, many of which have struggled to manage this crisis, and now face questions as to whether they acted too early or too late. More concerning is how right-wing populism thrives in and intensifies this climate of distrust. All over the world, populist figures advance a polarising worldview that pits corrupt political, corporate and scientific elites against an enlightened community of “common people”. Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro and Nigel Farage garner support by framing their struggle as one of the good leader against bad institutions. This worldview simultaneously undermines “the establishment”, and legitimises conspiracy theorists’ distrust. The implications of this are troubling. Distinctions between scientific truths and conspiracy theories have become blurred at the highest levels of government. Unproven solutions to control diseases are favoured over evidence-based interventions. Moreover, there is a growing resistance to vaccination in countries where political populism is on the rise. Policy interventions designed to solve problems are instead seen as part of the problem. An infodemic These considerations become even more important at a time when lockdown measures have led to people spending increased time on social media. In part, the internet enables those previously on the fringes of popular opinion to find and communicate with like-minded others. And while confidence in traditional institutions wanes, any number of alternative explanations resonate among friends in online groups. As people try to understand the pandemic and make sense of their changed lives, celebrity YouTube “truth seekers” are receiving unprecedented levels of attention. Although Facebook newsfeeds are littered with state-sanctioned public health advice, private groups are awash with bogus claims and misinformation that contradicts the official knowledge and political processes. The World Health Organization has declared this situation to be an “infodemic”. Pressure is now mounting on social media companies to restrict the flow of misinformation. Yet, within the truth seeker community, attempts by Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp to intervene are interpreted as further evidence that powerful institutions and elites are conspiring to conceal the “real truth”. Events such as the attacks on 5G masts offer a barometer to measure levels of trust in leadership and expertise. The challenge for governments and the media will be to demonstrate renewed levels of openness and solidarity to restore public trust, rather than fuelling this appetite for alternative truths.

Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, supports a moratorium on 5G development. He wrote in Scientific American that there could be health effects and that research needs to be funded.

The current coronavirus — which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19 — is spreading internationally. As of March 8, 2020, it had been detected in more than 100,000 people in more than 100 countries, including in the United States. Here’s what we know about how it emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China: COVID-19 \"\"is a zoonotic virus\"\" — that is, it was spread from animals to humans — according to a report from 25 international experts, including some from China and the U.S., convened by the World Health Organization. Bats \"\"appear to be the reservoir of COVID-19 virus,\"\" but the intermediate host or hosts — that is, how it went from bats to humans — has not been identified. Such viruses often originate in bats, although they sometimes can jump to another species before infecting humans. Chinese researchers have found a possible link between COVID-19 and pangolins, a mammal entirely covered in scales. Early on, many of the patients in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. The headline of an article shared on Facebook claimed, without verifiable evidence: \"\"Coronavirus Hoax: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome.\"\" World experts say the virus originated in an animal — perhaps in a bat that transmitted the virus to another animal, and then to humans.\"', 'label': 0, 'dataset': 'pubhealth', 'distance': 0.0}, {'text': 'In May 2020, a video started to circulate online that supposedly showed an Italian politician calling for the arrest of Bill Gates, the former Microsoft CEO who has been at the center of several conspiracy theories due to his foundation’s work to develop a vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. This video was frequently shared on social media with the caption, “Italian Government call for arrest of Bill Gates”: This is a genuine video of an Italian politician calling for Gates’ arrest. However, a single politician’s opinion does not equate to the entire Italian government calling for action. In fact, this view has been condemned by Italian government officials (you can hear this politician being told “enough” and to be quiet during the video). The politician in this video is Italian Parliament Member Sara Cunial. She’s part of Italy’s “5 Star Movement,” a political party that has been blamed for a rise of measles in Italy after pushing an anti-vaccination agenda. Cunial, who was briefly suspended from the party in 2018 after likening vaccines to “free genocide” in a Facebook post, was fined in April 2020 for violating one of the country’s shelter-in place policies to visit a beach. (Cunial claims she was never fined.) Cunial’s speech before the Italian Parliament hit on a number of popular (and discredited) conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19. For instance, she linked the spread of the disease to the rise of 5G technology, claimed that Gates was working to de-populate the world, and said that the “ID2020” coalition was working to secretly implement digital microchips via mandatory vaccines. Cunial also fabricated a quote from Gates. After claiming that this was an “exact quote” from a Gates’ speech, Cunial falsely said that the former Microsoft CEO once stated, “If we do a good job on vaccines, health and reproduction, we can reduce the world population by 10-15%. Only a genocide can save the world.” Not only is this a fabricated quote, it illustrates a common misconception about Gates’ work related to global population. The former Microsoft CEO is working to lower child mortality, improve the health of poorer populations, and give people better access to contraceptives. In other words, Gates is not trying to use vaccines to kill children. Rather, he is hoping that a lower child mortality rate and better supportive programs will reduce the need for parents to have more children. Gates articulated his goals in a 2009 letter from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: A surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the number of deaths actually reduces population growth. […] Contrary to the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children. Not only was Cunial’s speech littered with conspiracy theories, the politician also blamed Italy’s leadership for allowing dogmatic scientism to become the “true cultural epidemic” of this country. This comment created some blowback (Cunial curiously claimed that she was not referring to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte) and some politicians urged her to apologize for the remark.', 'label': 0, 'dataset': 'pubhealth', 'distance': 0.0}]\n"
