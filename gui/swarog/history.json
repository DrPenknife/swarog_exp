                              "text": "A common report by male recruits undergoing basic training is their inability to troop the morning colors, so to speak. Erections that came so easily before boot camp become few and far between. This surprising downturn of events is frequently attributed to the presence of saltpeter in the chow rather than to the powerful combination of anxiety to succeed, physical exhaustion, and a radical change of lifestyle. Barracks life also contributes to this suppression, with the knowledge of the close proximity of many others subconsciously working to inhibit that aspect of an individual\u2019s expression. \u201cI\u2019m worried that I might not make it through the training,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m dead tired,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t yet feel like this is my home,\u201d and \u201cThere are all these other guys around\u201d are weak-sounding admissions to give voice to, so it is comforting to instead be able to cling to the belief that the Army, in its all-knowing wisdom, must be slipping something into the food to cause what\u2019s seen as a striking physiological betrayal in young men who haven\u2019t previously experienced such a dry spell: Examples: It was certainly well-known that \u2018they put bromide in the tea/coffee\u2019 to reduce randiness, though such measures were hardly necessary in view of the strenuous regime we had to follow at the time. Such stories seem to have been prevalent everywhere and through the ages \u2014 \u2018the myth of the doctored wine.\u2019 It is reported that the sexual prowess of recruits always diminished, and who can be surprised at that? In France, the wine was doctored; in Poland it was the coffee. In South Africa, it was the food itself which contained a mysterious anaphrodisiac called \u2018blue-stone\u2019 \u2014 as it had allegedly been in the First World War. In Germany, iodine was put into the coffee, and soda into the meat. [Collected on the Internet, 2000] Potassium Nitrate! Saltpeter! The military used to put it in the eggs at breakfast so a certain \u201cjoint\u201d wouldn\u2019t get stiff when it wasn\u2019t supposed to. We could spot it right off in the Army. It, the saltpeter, gave the eggs a greenish tint. This need to believe that an outside force is deliberately working to keep things down fuels the saltpeter myth. Such a construct works to reassure the woodless recruit that there\u2019s nothing wrong with him \u2014 it\u2019s all the sneaky doings of those in charge. The myth is every bit as empowering as it is reassuring; it says \u201cWe are such rampantly virile men that those in command fear us and what we might do if left unchecked.\u201d It thus works to build pride in the unit by helping to establish an internalized reputation for being such wild men that the group as a whole has to be drugged into docility if its commanders are to have any hope of keeping it under control. Yet the truth is, there\u2019s no additional levels of saltpeter hidden in Army chow. There\u2019s also no proof potassium nitrate (saltpeter) has any effect on libido, plus or minus, so there would be nothing to be gained from such a doctoring of edibles. Yes, saltpeter has long rumored to be an anaphrodisiac, a substance that reduces sexual drive. But it\u2019s all rumor and no fact. Saltpeter has a long history of medical use. It and other nitrates were employed by doctors during the 18th century to treat such varied problems as asthma, sore throats, and arthritis. Not that it was used wisely for these purposes, however \u2014 physicians were far less knowledgeable in those days, and potassium nitrate\u2019s hazards were not then understood as well as they are now. Saltpeter can be toxic in large quantities. It can cause anemia, methemoglobinemia (a blood disorder), headache, stomach upset, dizziness, kidney damage, and can raise one\u2019s blood pressure to a dangerous level. It is thus strongly recommended against, and no one in his right mind would dose himself or anyone else with it. Given that saltpeter doesn\u2019t suppress sexual urges and is dangerous to use, the Army lacks any reason to administer it to those within its ranks. Yet those two facts will probably do little to dissuade those who are certain the coffee continues to taste funny.",

The market is smaller, but the potential may be bigger with health-conscious consumers seeking lower-calorie foods amid mounting concerns about obesity and diabetes. \u201cWe use mushrooms that we train specifically to remove unwanted aspects of food and infuse it with the natural health benefits of the mushroom,\u201d said Alan Hahn, chief executive of MycoTechnology, Inc, formed in 2013 in Denver, Colorado. \u201cParticularly with chocolate, the bitterness is a big issue. We remove that bitterness and the need for sugar is reduced drastically.\u201d  About half of the average milk chocolate bar is made of sugar, according to industry experts. Hahn said his MycoSmooth technology, invented by the company\u2019s chief science officer Brooks J. Kelly, can cut the amount of sugar needed in the average chocolate bar by half, from 31 grams to about 15 grams. The company is in talks with \u201cmajor chocolate players\u201d in the United States, but Hahn declined to name them. From its Denver headquarters, the company will start processing its own beans as well as those on behalf of its customers and will license out the technology. The process will compete with other more widely used methods, including the \u201cDutching\u201d process that was developed in the 1800s and modifies the bean\u2019s taste with an alkalizing agent. MycoTechnology\u2019s chemical-free process reduces the bitterness, rather than masking it, at minimal cost. It adds \u201cpennies per lb\u201d to the cost of cocoa, Hahn said. MycoTechnology\u2019s chocolate plans may, however, not be as simple as they first appear. Cutting the sugar content may pose new hurdles for confectionery makers if they cut sugar use and replace it with higher cocoa or milk content. Both are more expensive than sugar. \u201cIf you wind up taking sugar out and raising the (cocoa) liquor content, you will raise the fat content of the bar, which will be higher calories,\u201d said Ed Seguine, president of Seguine Cacao Cocoa & Chocolate Advisors in Hanover, Pennsylvania, with over 30 years\u2019 experience in chocolate product research. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make economic sense because you\u2019ve got to put something in its place,\u201d Seguine said. After coffee and cocoa, MycoTechnology is looking at widening the use of its procedure to bulk agricultural markets like rice and other grains. In the process, MycoTechnology takes fermented beans, sterilizes them and then inoculates them with their unique strains of mushroom root systems that have been trained specifically to remove bitterness. The beans are then placed in a sealed bag and for the following seven to 21 days, the roots do their work. Mushrooms naturally feed on moisture, oxygen and sugars.",

                              "text": "From the first minute Ellen Shepherd - a kindergarten-to-5th-grade special education teacher - picketed Thursday morning, along with other school employees in Elkins, West Virginia, community members showed their support.  \"It was amazing,\" said Shepherd, who is also the president of the Randolph County Education Association. \"People were stopping to offer support, coffee, doughnuts, stuff all day long,\" she added.  \"Most importantly, those who weren't sure about was going on stopped and asked us, so we were able to explain why we are here, what we are doing, and what got us to this point.\"  After months of writing legislators, attending hearings, and holding educational pickets before and after school, the three teachers' unions representing educators across the US state of West Virginia announced a collective walkout for Thursday and Friday, forcing all public schools to close.  On Friday afternoon, the unions announced the strike will continue on Monday.  The teachers are demanding higher wages and better benefits as they struggle to afford rising healthcare costs.  On both Thursday and Friday, thousands sang and chanted at the state capitol building in Charleston, calling for an agreement before the end of the legislative session on March 10.  According to local media, teachers in the state set up food banks to ensure students who depend on school meals were fed during the strike.  Struggling to fill positions  While the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, West Virginia School Service Personnel Association, and West Virginia Education Association have historically competed for members and influence, they unified in the face of reduced healthcare coverage and doubling insurance premiums, copays and deductibles.  Cuts to benefits forced Mary Stiles, a high school teacher in Morgantown, to stop taking a medication that was no longer covered by the mandatory Public Employees Insurance Agency plan required for all government employees.  Critics in the government and local communities, Stiles said, \"are trying to make it look like we're being greedy, that we want this big raise\".  \"But, we want our medical insurance to be fully funded and we want good coverage,\" she told Al Jazeera, not just for educators, but for all public employees.  Organisers have said that salaries are so low, that many have had to take second jobs to support their families  As salaries and benefits have declined, so have teaching incentives, and the number of vacancies has risen to more than 700.  There are nearly 20,000 teachers employed by the state.  Shepherd told Al Jazeera: \"We cannot fill kindergarten positions, music positions \u2026 English, special ed, social studies: positions that were a given in the past.\"  West Virginia Governor Jim Justice signed legislation this week that gives teachers a two percent pay increase in July. It will be followed by a one percent increase over the next two years. The bill, however, reduces the increase that had been previously proposed.  West Virginia's public school employees are also concerned about legalising taxpayer-funded private school vouchers and increasing the number of charter schools, policies which have been at the core of US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's policy platform.  'A risk worth taking'  Though teachers have not gone on strike since 1990, teachers' unions in West Virginia rank 13th in the United States, according to a 2012 study which found that they were formidable and thoroughly engaged state politics and in developing policies.  Viewed as the birthplace of the US labour movement, West Virginia has a long history of strong unions that organised workers such as coal miners, craftsmen, and nurses to collectively bargain for improved wages, working conditions, and healthcare.  However, it is illegal under West Virginia law for public employees to go on strike, and teachers risk fines or imprisonment by continuing the walkout.  At a meeting to discuss legal ramifications, Shepherd told Al Jazeera that the response of the 300 assembled educators was unanimous: \"Our kids are more important.\"  Shepherd added: \"So, yes, we face that risk, but that's a risk that's worth taking because our kids and their education is so valuable to us.\"  In a statement released on February 20, West Virginia Superintendent of Schools Steven Paine noted the illegality of work stoppages by public employees and encouraged \"educators to advocate for the benefits they deserve, but to seek courses of action that have the least possible disruption for our students\".  While educators hope that an agreement will be reached quickly, the unions are taking it day by day.  \"Let's call a spade a spade: It's a strike,\" said Josh Nelson, who has been teaching high school Spanish and English in Huntington for three years. \"We don't know when this will end.\"  Potential next steps for the unions include returning to work for a few days before resuming the stoppage, having rolling walkouts by county, or continuing the statewide strike until changes are made.  \"West Virginia teachers have been terribly, terribly slighted for a long time,\" said Cindy Stemple, a retired teacher and union member who worked for public schools in West Virginia for 35 years.  \"People are fed up with it, they've had enough,\" she added.",

                              "text": "Keywords: pet care , pet care tips \nHaving a pet or a companion animal is an amazing thing as the little bundle of joy loves you immensely without asking for much in return. But they do want your little time and attention. Pets are just like kids who need care and support from you, and if they don\u2019t get these things, then they can become victims of infection, malnutrition, and diseases. Therefore, here we have listed some important pet care tips so that you can easily keep your pet happy and healthy. Train your pet \nBehavioral training is very important for dogs and cats especially when you have children at the house. Proper training can reduce their aggression and help them to accommodate easily in your home environment. If you are not well experienced with pet training, then you can take help of a professional trainer to train them like sitting on command or walking on a leash. Spaying and neutering \nIf you have many pets and you don\u2019t want an increase in their numbers, then you can get them spayed or neutered by a vet. It also benefits your pet as it reduces the chances of your pet getting lost because the tendency to roam around will decrease after spaying and neutering. It also lowers the risk of certain cancers, hernias in male pets and uterine infection in females. Induce natural healing \nIncreasing immunity of your pet is very important, and you can do with a much safer approach. Animal oral nosodes provide a wide range of protection to your pet from various diseases like Corona virus, Lyme disease, West Nile virus. Tick fever etc. and they are very easy to administer as it can be given either by mouth. This natural alternative is safe and has many advantages over the conventional vaccines, many of which are found to be carcinogenic or having side effects. Body cleaning \nIt is important to get your pet habitual to bathing and other cleaning activities like clipping nails, flea or tick examination, etc. from an early age so it doesn\u2019t get surprised when you give it a bath or try to cut its nails. They can even attack you in defense if they are not used to these activities. Keep them active \nWalking your dog early in the morning is good for him and you as well. It gives you time to bond and keeps both of you fit. Besides that, you must play with your pets regularly to keep them active. You can use a Frisbee or ball to play with your pets or tell them to chase you while you run. These activities benefit both of you mutually. Skincare \nThis is very important especially in the case of pets with a white coat or less pigmentation as they are prone to skin inflammation and skin cancers. Also, check your pet regularly for any external parasite like fleas as it can cause irritated skin, hair loss, hot spots, infection and introduction of other parasites like a tapeworm in your pet. After cleaning and check up, groom your pet by brushing their coat as it helps in reducing hair shedding by them. Watch their diet \nChildren tend to feed their pet anything even their favorite food without knowing that it can be harmful to them, therefore, inform your young ones about the right food for your pet. Food items containing alcohol, coffee, chocolate, poultry bones, salt or unripe fruit can be bad for your pets. You can also ask your vet about other food items which must not be given to your pet. Moreover, you also need to check the weight of your pet regularly as less physical activity and regular feeding can make them obese or overweight. Pet bedding \nProper rest is equally necessary for the overall well-being of your pet, and they need a corner for their own for that. You should pick a spot in your house which is warm, clean and quiet to make their bed. Their bedding should be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent any parasites like ticks and fleas. Provide a healthy environment \nYour pet can understand your mood as it is a living being like you, therefore, try to act happily around them. You must have seen that your cat is scratching the post or toys or your dog becomes restless when you come home. They do these things because they need mental stimulation. Give them toys to play, take them on a walk and play with them to reduce their restlessness and keep their boredom away. Pet identification \nThis prevents your pet from getting lost or taken away by the municipal persons by considering them as stray ones. Make them wear a collar with the address of your house so that it can be returned to you if it gets lost. These days, microchips are used to identify the pet. These microchips are of the size of a rice grain and placed under the skin of the pet within a second. It doesn\u2019t require any battery and sensitive enough to be scanned and tracked easily by a vet or animal control officer. You might also like\u2026",

                              "text": "Carmela Tyrell November 6, 2016 Surviving Off-grid: 5 Ways to Manage Chimney Creosote \nThe government is doing everything it can to deter people from burning wood , it still remains popular with home owners that don\u2019t want to use oil or other more expensive fuels. Wood is also very popular with off gridders, preppers, and homesteaders because it can be harvested from natural resources or grown for this purpose. \nMany people that burn wood are plagued by creosote that builds up in chimneys. As dangerous as this problem can become, preventing or reducing creosote buildup is not as hard as it seems to be. \nHere are five ways you can reduce or prevent creosote buildup in your chimneys. \nDo not forget to inspect your chimneys on a regular basis and clean them even if the creosote only looks like it is in the early stages of buildup. \nHow Does Creosote Form? \nHave you ever blown on a mirror or piece of glass so that some of the water vapor from your lungs condenses on the glass? If so, then you may also know that condensation occurs because the glass is cooler than the air exiting your mouth. \nIn a similar way, when hot gas and smoke enter the chimney, they are hotter than the stove pipe. If the pipe is not hot enough, then creosote will condense out of the smoke and be deposited in the chimney. Video first seen on Corey Binford . \nThe Three Degrees of Creosote Buildup \nAs with many other situations in life, creosote build up may not be especially dangerous at first. However, if it is left unchecked, or not taken care of soon enough, it can become a very expensive problem. As you review the three degrees of creosote buildup, bear in mind that simply cleaning up the mess is only part of the problem. You will still need to take active steps to prevent or at least slow down further creosote buildup. \n1st Degree \nJust about every chimney will build up layers of soft black material known as soot. If you can easily brush the black layer of material out of the chimney, chances are there is actually very little creosote in it. \nMany people consider this a good sign because it means the fire is burning hot enough to reduce the amount of temperature difference between the smoke and the chimney. While this stage isn\u2019t especially dangerous, you will still need to clean out the chimney on a routine basis in order to keep good air flow. \n2nd Degree \nAt this level, you will start to see more creosote in the soot. There will be quite a few shiny black flakes of material that can still be removed if you put some effort into it. If you see this kind of soot, it is very important to increase the air flow in the burning area. \n3rd Degree \nThis type of creosote buildup forms layers of a tar like coating on inner surfaces of the chimney. If you think about how cholesterol builds up in arteries, then you have a pretty good picture of what I mean. \n3 rd Degree creosote also contains a good bit of unburned fuel . As a result, when it does catch fire, it can be quite dangerous. The third degree of creosote buildup is caused by cool burning fires with inadequate ventilation, or by a flue that is too large. \nHere are five ways to resolve this type of buildup. You may need a combination of answers in order to reduce the level of creosote buildup as much as possible. \n1. Keep a Robust Airflow \nHave you ever lit a candle, and then put it in a glass cup? If so, then you have also probably seen soot build up on the sides of the glass. \nWhen a fire burns under any kind of restricted air flow, the soot from the fire will also concentrate and condense into smaller areas. Typically, fireplaces that have glass doors, or are otherwise closed off will have the most problems with airflow. \nHere\u2019s what you can do to remedy this problem: Keep the ash bin and grate area as clean as possible. Open the damper so that more air gets into the fireplace. If you cannot get enough air moving in the fireplace, try using a fan or blower to push more air in through the damper. Make sure that the fan is made of metal or some other non-flammable material. Aside from purchasing a new model, you may also find some old, or vintage blowers at a flea market for a much lower price. Never underestimate the power or durability of these old, but incredibly durable blowers and fans! In some cases, downdrafts from the outside can also cause poor air circulation inside the stove. You can try adding a partial cover to the top of outer pipe. Alternatively, add an insert with an inward curve that will also reduce the amount of downdraft that can get down the chimney. \n2. Keep the Fire Hot \nEven though you may think of a piece of wood as a single object, it is actually made up of all kinds of molecules. This, in turn, means that some molecules will have a higher kindling point than others. \nIf the fire is not hot enough, some of the molecules that require a hotter temperature will escape into the chimney and form a layer of creosote if the conditions are right. Later on, if the temperature inside the chimney gets hot enough, these particles will catch fire and burn. \nThe hotter the fire is, the better chance there is of these molecules being reduced to heat and ash in the fireplace. In addition, the hotter the fire is, the hotter the chimney will be. When the chimney is hot enough, all the gunk that forms creosote cannot collect. \nHere are some ways to increase the heat output from a wood fire: add a few handfuls of coal to the wood fire. Coal burns at a higher temperature and will also last longer. Without a question, anyone that has used a coal fire on a freezing winter night can tell you just how delightful they are! install heat retaining bricks in the fireplace. This will increase the temperature inside the burn area and help keep the temperature steadier. insulate the chimney pipe with bricks. This is especially important if you are using a metal chimney, as they will always be cooler on the inner surface. The insulation will help, however it will not entirely solve the problem if it is caused by using a metal chimney. \n3. Check the Size of the Flue \nConsider a situation where you want to heat up a cup of coffee over a campfire. Chances are it will only take a few minutes to achieve this goal. Now let\u2019s say you want to heat up a gallon of water over the exact same campfire. \nHeating up a gallon of water will take longer than a cup because there are more atoms to deal with. In a similar way, when the flue is too large, there is simply too much material for the fire to contend with. A wood stove should not have a flue larger than six inches. \nWhen you reduce the size of the flue, it allows less heat to escape. Some people have noticed a 20% or better increase in heat produced by fireplaces that have an optimally sized flue. Therefore, you will be reducing creosote problems and get more heat at the same time. \nDepending on the construction of the stove and chimney system, you may not be able to simply rip the whole thing out and start over again. Your best option will be to insert a sleeve into the chimney so that it has a smaller internal diameter. Even though these sleeves are usually made of metal, the surrounding brick in the chimney should keep it warm enough to reduce the risk of creosote build up. If you still get too much creosote, focus on increasing the heat produced by the fire and the amount of air flow going up into the chimney. Remember, the more air flow you have going up the chimney, the harder it will be for particles to stay still long enough to attach to inner surfaces. You may also want to let the wood season longer than a few months, and choose some type of wood other than pine. Look for wood that has less resin or sap in it. It is also very important to stay away from pellets or other types of pre-manufactured wood because they may be designed to burn at lower temperatures than what you will need to heat up an over sized chimney. \n4. Make Sure the Wood is Fully Seasoned and Dry \nHave you ever tried to start a fire during or after it rains? If you are camping, chances are you use a number of methods to dry the wood out as much as possible so that it produces more heat than smoke. \nIn a similar way, when wood is not fully seasoned and dried out, it will produce more creosote. Fires that produce a lot of smoke also have the following problems: there is less airflow, which reduces the amount of oxygen available to the fire the fire will burn cooler because water impedes combustion smoke is also a sign that more fuel is escaping into the air than you would get from a cleaner burning fire. \nThere is no substitute for time when it comes to seasoning wood. You can try keeping logs closer to the fire place for a few days before you actually burn them. Just remember to rotate them often so that the log dries out more evenly. \nChopping the log into smaller pieces might help too. This will increase surface area, which in turn will speed up water evaporation. You will still need to rotate the wood around to ensure the fastest possible drying. \nWhen it comes to seasoning wood , many people make the mistake of covering the wood with a waterproof, air tight tarp. The wood will release water vapor, however it will fall right back onto the wood and be absorbed all over again. \nYou will be better served by keeping the wood loosely covered and in a warm, sunny spot while it is drying. As with drying the wood out indoors, do not forget to rotate the woodpile every few days so that the pieces dry out as much and as evenly as possible. \nIf the weather is especially damp, humid, or rainy, it may be of some help to cut the wood into smaller pieces. No matter how you look at it, increasing surface area always speeds up evaporation. It may seem like a lot of extra work, however it will pay off when you have hotter fires   and fewer problems with creosote. \n5. Do Not Overload the Stove With Wood \nWhen you have had a long, hard day, it is tempting to load the stove with as much wood as possible so you won\u2019t have to add more through the night. On the other side of the equation, when you put too much wood in the stove, it reduces air flow. \nAside from this, when fires burn, they also release some water vapor. When there is too much wood in the stove, some of that vapor may just land on the wood and increase its moisture level. No matter how well seasoned the wood is, that increased moisture will cause the fire to burn poorly. \nHere are some ways to resolve this problem: start off by adding just one piece at a time to the fire. If the fire burns well, try adding a second piece. Keep adding more pieces as long as the fire burns cleanly. Do not forget that you may not be able to add as many pieces at one time on rainy days or ones where it is impossible to prevent a downdraft from the chimney. install an automatic wood feeder. Even thought a wood feeder can take up a good bit of space, it may be a better solution than trying to manually feed the stove. Use coal and other materials that might burn longer during times when you won\u2019t be available to feed the stove more wood. \nWherever you live in (an apartment or a house), chances are the building will have a chimney, and there will also be a stove available for burning wood . Getting started with wood burning is not especially difficult, but avoiding creosote buildup in the chimney can be challenge. \nBe careful about the condition of the fire, the wood, and ventilation issues that may lead to creosote buildup. Once you find a way to reduce the speed of creosote buildup, do not forget to inspect the chimney on a regular basis. \nA clean chimney is not just a safe one, it is a valuable asset that will help you burn wood efficiently and get the most from it. \n  Carmela Tyrell for Survivopedia. 464 total views, 463 views today",

                              "text": "5 Sources of Extra Energy for Entrepreneurs Image credit: Shutterstock --- Shares July 21, 2016 \nI decided to get serious about my health and fitness at the end of last year , which involved starting a very strict workout regimen, beginning at 5 a.m. every morning. I also switched to a standing desk -- another move designed to improve my health. \nI did this to get into great shape, but also to improve my overall energy. Being an entrepreneur involves long hours -- it\u2019s a constant grind that doesn\u2019t shut off after 5 p.m. or on the weekends. 1. Caffeinated beverages. \nI feel like caffeine gets a bad wrap sometimes. There are going to be drawbacks and cons for almost everything, but there are several health benefits of including caffeine in your diet. The key is to limit your caffeine intake -- according to the Mayo Clinic , 400 milligrams per day is perfectly fine for a healthy adult. For reference, there is 80 mg of caffeine in an 8.4 oz can of Red Bull, which is similar to the average cup of coffee. \nRelated: 5 All-Natural Ways to Boost Energy, Fast \nStart your day with a coffee and keep a few energy drinks in the office for those times that you need a bit of energy to power through your tasks. You don\u2019t want to rely entirely on caffeine, but you don\u2019t have to avoid it like the plaque, either. There is nothing wrong with using it in moderation. 2. Frequent smaller meals. \nIt's better to eat small meals and snacks every few hours than three large meals a day, if you want to increase your energy, according to Harvard Medical School . Eating frequent smaller meals reduces your perception of fatigue because the brain requires a steady supply of nutrients and has very few energy reserves. \nMost individuals will start to feel sluggish after a few hours without eating. You don\u2019t need a huge meal to fuel your brain -- a piece of fruit or a small snack, such as almonds, will do the trick. I eat six smaller meals a day, opposed to the standard three meals. While it was difficult to adjust to at first, it has definitely improved my energy levels. Prepping your meals in advance is a huge advantage and will help you stay on the six-per-day schedule. 3. Kratom. \nI incorporate supplementation into my diet, and recently started looking into Kratom , or Mitragyna Speciosa, an herb used to help people stay alert. A plant native to Southeast Asia in the coffee family, many claim it helps to increase concentration and energy levels. After trying it, I would compare it to a very powerful caffeine pill or a very strong pre-workout supplement. \nRelated: How to Build the Stamina You Need As An Entrepreneur \nKratom is a supplement that, since around 2012, has really caused quite the buzz online. In higher doses, it has been said to be used as a pain killer, and because of this, a few states have banned the plant-derived supplement, with Alabama being the latest . If you have tried this supplement, tweet me , as I am interested in hearing about your experience. 4. NAD+ booster. \nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential metabolite in all human cells and it plays a key role in cellular metabolism. Many use this supplement for its anti-aging and metabolism benefits, but it has also been shown to offer several other health benefits. These include increased endurance, improved mental focus and memory, and increasing muscle endurance. \nI was first turned onto this product as part of my training supplementation and I quickly experienced the mental focus benefits, which contributed to a much more energetic state. There are many benefits aside from increased energy and I encourage you to explore them. 5. Sleep. \nLast, but not least, is good old fashion sleep. Adequate sleep is necessary for healthy functioning . There is no denying we all need sleep; it regulates mood and is a critical factor in your energy level. I think it\u2019s important to find out what works best for you personally, rather than just going along with the perceived notion that eight hours a night is ideal. For me, I am good on just four hours, yet I know individuals that can\u2019t function on anything less than 10 hours. \nRelated: 18 Unusual Habits That Boost Your Energy More Than Coffee \nSleep will help you restore your energy levels, but did you also know that getting adequate sleep the first night after learning a new skill is important for improving memory and performance ? As entrepreneurs, we are constantly absorbing new information and skills, which is another reason to make sure you get a solid sleep every night.

                              "text": "Print Claire Coffee, who plays the witchy Adalind on the fantasy TV drama \u201cGrimm,\u201d has been managing migraine symptoms since childhood. Now she shares how she reduces their frequency... On the TV show \u201cGrimm,\u201d Claire Coffee\u2019s character is a sorceress whose outer beauty is frequently uglified by her inner darkness. In real life, she\u2019s also occasionally taken over by something unpleasant: painful migraine symptoms. Coffee, 36, openly shares the fact that she suffers from the severe headaches. She even joked on Twitter that her character\u2019s nasty disposition could be caused by migraine pain. \u201cIf only Adalind had [an eletriptan],\u201d said @ClaireCoffee in an Oct. 14, 2014, post, referring to a prescription migraine medication. The actress is one of 36 million Americans who suffer from migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, a nonprofit that funds research into the condition. Not only do more women \u2013 27 million \u2013 have migraines, they also have them more often than men. Migraine symptoms frequently last longer in women too, the MRF reports. In addition to debilitating pain, migraines symptoms include: Aura (visual disturbances) Sensitivity to sound and light Dizziness Nausea Potential triggers include certain foods \u2013 chocolate, for example \u2013 or skipping meals, alcohol, bright lights, loud noises, strong odors, caffeine, stress and hormonal changes. For some women, pregnancy makes migraines worse. Not for Coffee. In fact, she found relief from her condition when she was pregnant with her son Calvin. (Coffee and husband musician Chris Thile of the Punch Brothers and Nickel Creek announced the birth of their son in May 2015.) In this exclusive Lifescript interview, Coffee talks about her lifelong journey to manage migraines. When were you first diagnosed with migraines? I\u2019ve experienced migraines since elementary school, around 3rd or 4th grade. As a teenager, they became especially bad, which I attributed to hormones and puberty. [But] I saw a couple of neurologists before I was diagnosed with migraines. [ Editor\u2019s note: Migraines can be harder to diagnose in children because their symptoms may differ from those of adults, according to the National Institutes of Health. Kids can have migraine pain on both sides of their head; adults usually have it only on one side. Sometimes, a child\u2019s only symptom is vomiting.] Did other members of your family have them? My dad has always had migraines too. I know there\u2019s some evidence that migraine headaches run in families. What triggers your migraines? I\u2019ve also found that stress, changes in my sleep patterns, eating too many sweets and going for more than four hours without eating food can all trigger migraines. What have you found helps you to manage your migraines? I take [eletriptan], a prescription medication that blocks migraine headaches in progress. [ Editor\u2019s note: Triptan medications help ease migraine symptoms by acting on chemical receptors and constricting blood vessels in the brain.] I also started doing acupuncture the last several years and have found it really helps a lot. [ Editor\u2019s note: Migraine patients who underwent acupuncture had less intense migraines and fewer episodes per month, according to a 2012 study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.] I used to get 4 to 6 migraines a month, but I\u2019ve learned to manage them pretty well. I typically only get one migraine a month now. Have you tried other natural treatments? I have an herbalist who has blended together a mixture of herbs, such as butterbur, [along with] peppermint oil, that help with my migraines. [ Editor\u2019s note: There\u2019s some evidence that butterbur extract may reduce the frequency of migraines, but not much research has been done, according to the Migraine Trust, a British health and research charity that supports people with migraines. Menthol, the active ingredient of peppermint oil, was effective at helping stop migraine pain and easing nausea when applied to the forehead and temples, according to a 2010 study published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice.] Did being pregnant make your migraines worse? I was really worried about what effect my pregnancy would have on my migraines. I had heard some women say they were more prone to migraines during their pregnancy. But I actually had a reduction in the number of migraine headaches that I experienced. I had a few flare-ups, but chose to manage them naturally through exercise or using a cold compress. See Pregnancy and Migraine Headaches: What Women Need to Know Did you make any dietary changes after you were diagnosed with migraines? I did a food-elimination diet to see if certain foods were triggering my migraines . But after eliminating foods and then adding them back in, I found the only trigger for me was sugar. Eating too much sugar can cause me to have a migraine, and so can low blood sugar caused by skipping meals. I\u2019m a big snacker, so I try to snack on lean proteins and vegetables that keep my [blood] glucose levels steady in between meals. When I\u2019m on set, I might snack on yogurt or nuts, and then have a salad with lean meats such as fish or chicken for lunch. How do you handle the stress of performing? \u201cGrimm\u201d is filmed in Portland, Ore., and I love hiking on the beautiful trails with my husband. Just being outdoors really calms me, and hiking \u2013 or even walking \u2013 is a great form of exercise. If I\u2019m indoors, I\u2019ve learned that deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress in the body. On your blog , Full Disclothesure, you write about health and beauty advice you\u2019ve acquired during your career. What tips can you share? I was lucky in that I had a great pregnancy \u2013 with no morning sickness or heartburn. But the one thing I had was a red, blotchy skin rash. My pregnancy hormones had made my skin incredibly sensitive to dryness. Any amount of parched air sent it into a fit of rage, and my [usual] coconut oil regimen just wasn't replenishing the moisture loss. I knew that a lot of active skin care ingredients are off-limits to pregnant women \u2013 and I tend to be a natural skin-care junkie. So I began working with my skin-care guru to find products that would prevent moisture loss while also creating a barrier from the elements. While this solution might not work for everyone, I found that rinsing in the morning with an essential cleansing oil, followed by a serum containing hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 \u2013 and a few drops of pure Jojoba oil \u2013 really helped. In the evening, I repeated this, but also added a daily moisturizer. For more information and expert advice, visit Lifescript\u2019s Migraine Health Center .

JOSEPH JOHNSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nThere was a long construction hiatus at The Terrace in 2015. \n\"We've got enough leases signed, we've got bank funding in place and it's all go,\" he said. \"I expect to be enjoying a beer there in October.\" READ MORE: * Westpac pulls back on commitment to Gough development \nThe double-storey riverfront hospitality precinct was almost fully leased with 12 out of 14 premises taken, he said. Tenants in the three large ground floor premises facing Oxford Tce will be Richard Sinke, owner of Dux Central, and Tony Astle's Stealth Hospitality Group, plus restaurant Bangalore Polo Club. \nAstle said he was looking forward to getting in and the precinct would be \"wonderful\". KIRK HARGREAVES/FAIRFAX NZ \nAntony Gough is confident The Terrace development will be ready to open in spring. \nUpstairs and facing interior laneways will be Japanese restaurant Zenbu, two Cook Brothers hospitality businesses, a restaurant from the operators of Queenstown restaurant Bungalow, and a new business from former Coyote owner Clive Weston. Velvet Burger, a juice bar and coffee outlets will open on the Hereford St side of the development. \nThe buildings will be linked by laneways and first-floor air bridges, while balconies will overlook the river and internal spaces. Hospitality tenants will start fitting out their premises in June or July. \nA five-storey office building on Hereford St will also be finished by October, while the six-storey office building on the corner of Oxford Tce and Cashel St would be finished in December for tenants Westpac and KPMG to move in by March, Gough said. \nAn artist's impression of The Terrace precinct facing Oxford Tce between Cashel and Hereford streets, in Christchurch. \nNext year, a car parking building will be added on Hereford St next to the neighbouring BNZ Centre. Ad Feedback \nGough said when Westpac reduced the space it wanted it \"threw us into a bit of a tizz\", but KPMG had filled the gap, satisfying the bank's lending department. Other tenants had also been holding back. \nBNZ is funding the development's hospitality buildings and the Hereford St office building. Gough and other members of the family, including his older brothers Tracy and Harcourt, have put about $70m into the project. \nAn impression of the finished Westpac building and courtyard at The Terrace development. \nGough said meeting the banks' lending requirements had proven tough. \n\"They are overly cautious, but they can afford to be. But once the banks start paying money out on a project like this, they see it through to the end.\" \nThe upcoming openings of the justice and emergency services precinct and the Ngai Tahu office buildings nearby had boosted tenants' confidence, he said. Progress on car parking buildings had also helped. \n\"We are seeing all these developments finish and I can't wait for that parking to open.\" \nSLOW PROGRESS \n2011: Antony Gough hopes to repair and reopen The Strip. \nMarch 2013: Joins forces with brother Tracy to announce a replacement called The Terrace. \nSept 2013: Gough goes it alone and starts construction with a late-2014 finish forecast. Gerry Brownlee hails Gough as the CBD's greatest champion. \nApril 2014: Construction stops as bankers demand more equity. \nJuly 2015: Work re-starts with Gough brothers Harcourt and Tracy as co-investors. \nDecember 2015: Tenant Westpac reduces space requirement, construction stops. \nFebruary 2016: Finish date revised to February 2017. \nSeptember 2016: KPMG signs on as tenant. \nDecember 2016: Bankers approve loans based on tenant commitments. \nFebruary 2017: Two cranes and construction workers busy on site.

Right now, there are no approved treatments for the illness caused by the new coronavirus. A severe form of lung failure called acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death in COVID-19. When lungs are failing, air is received by some parts of them but not others. Nitric oxide is a gas that improves blood flow in areas of the lungs that are getting air, increasing the amount of oxygen in the blood stream. Nitric oxide also reduces the workload of the right side of the heart, which is under extreme stress during lung failure. Along with being used to treat failing lungs, nitric oxide has been found to have antiviral properties against coronaviruses. That was shown during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, which was caused by a coronavirus similar to the one that causes COVID-19. Any COVID-19 patient in UAB's intensive care unit who is using a ventilator to breathe may qualify for the study. \"This trial will allow the sickest COVID-19 patients at UAB access to a rescue therapy that may have antiviral benefits in addition to improving the status of lungs,\" Dr. Vibhu Parcha said in a university news release. He's a research fellow in the Division of Cardiovascular Disease. \"In humans, nitric oxide is generated within the blood vessels and regulates blood pressure, and prevents the formation of clots and also destroys potential toxins,\" said Dr. Pankaj Arora, an assistant professor of cardiovascular disease. His team plans to study the cardiovascular effects of high-dose inhaled nitric oxide as part of the primary clinical trial.",

February 19, 2020 \u2022 By Rebecca Batisto Employee Risks If you watch or listen to the news, then you\u2019ve heard about coronavirus, the new viral (both figuratively and literally) outbreak in China, that\u2019s spreading worldwide. There are a lot of misconceptions about the virus, including a meme that\u2019s currently circulating throughout social media that says, \u201cBefore you start popping that bubble wrap, that air came from China.\u201d But, the virus is spreading and causing companies to shut down offices in China. So, as an employer or an insurance agent, you may be concerned about the risks to employees. We, at Normandy Insurance, are staying on top of the story as it unfolds, and here\u2019s a synopsis of the things you need to know thus far. What Is Coronavirus? The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (officially \u201cCOVID-19\u201d) is a respiratory virus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It is part of a large family of coronaviruses, of which SARS is an infamous member. COVID-19 likely was initially contracted from an animal and is now being spread person-to-person. It produces symptoms of mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The spread from person-to-person occurs in close contact via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, according to the CDC\u2019s website. These droplets can land on others and be ingested or inhaled, or land on surfaces where people touch and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes. There have been several documented cases in the U.S. in the last few weeks, and the U.S. is taking aggressive actions to stem the spread of COVID-19 in this country, including the use of quarantine measures as appropriate. Travel bans are currently in place, with some airlines voluntarily canceling flights in a proactive move to halt the spread of the coronavirus and protect airline employees and passengers from exposure. Cruise ships with confirmed cases of the virus are currently under quarantine, some of them for upwards of two weeks. Yet shipments from China continue to our shores via shipping containers and air transport. Should that be a concern? What About Products Shipped From China? While researchers are continuing to study how 2019-nCoV is spread, they are using two other coronaviruses (MERS and SARS) as guidelines. In general, COVID-19 does not survive long on surfaces, and so there is a low risk of spread from products or packaging, according to the CDC. Further, the extended time, plus temperatures of shipments, again reduces the likelihood of spread. To date, there are no cases associated with imported goods or packaging from China or anywhere else in the world. Shipments of animals and food undergo more rigorous testing, and again, no cases have been reported to date. The entire world is closely monitoring the COVID-19 spread since China is such an economic powerhouse with exports across the globe. What Precautions Should You Take? Because of the travel bans imposed by many countries, travel to China is not advised. Thankfully communication technology allows us to communicate effectively without needing to board a plane. Chinese citizens understand the severity and seriousness of the outbreak and its impact on travel and business during this time, so it\u2019s unlikely your employees will be pressured to head to the airport. Employees returning from China may be subject to monitoring or quarantine, depending on where they visited. If any employee returns from China and shows any flu-like symptoms, they should go to the hospital at once. Employees who handle products imported from China should be educated about COVID-19 and how it is spread, including the fact that it is not believed to be able to survive on a surface through transport. Your insurance provider may offer an expert to come and speak to your workforce if you deem this necessary. If you are a Normandy customer with concerns, contact us to discuss risks and options: call 866-688-6442 What\u2019s Next? Based on the similar coronavirus outbreaks of MERS and SARS, it is hoped that researchers and health professionals will soon be able to curtail the spread of the deadly COVID-19. The on-going risk will depend upon what is learned about the characteristics of the virus, including how exactly it spreads, and available measures to treat the virus. What is known so far is that the risk of infection is related to exposure; therefore, most of the U.S. public is unlikely to be exposed to the virus.
