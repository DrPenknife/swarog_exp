But early research suggests that another common symptom may be often overlooked: stomach upset. A recent analysis of more than 200 people admitted to three hospitals in Hubei, China -- the province where the virus called SARS-CoV-2 originated -- with mild cases of COVID-19 found that almost 1 in 5 had at least one gastrointestinal symptom, such as diarrhea, vomiting, or belly pain. Nearly 80% also lacked an appetite. Those symptoms can stem from other common causes, including stomach flu or food poisoning. But if you have COVID-19, GI problems may slow your recovery. And the digestive symptoms may worsen as you get sicker. Gastrointestinal Link Once any virus infects your body, it can destroy healthy cells and make multiple copies of itself. COVID-19 mainly attacks the cells lining your airways. This makes it hard for you to breathe and can lead to pneumonia. But researchers think the illness also may harm your digestive tract and liver tissue. The study in China found that a third of the people with mild COVID-19 had diarrhea. The problem, including watery stool, was usually not severe. The diarrhea lasted for an average of 5 days. Those with digestive symptoms were more likely to have a positive stool test for the coronavirus, which means they had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their poop. It also took them longer to clear the virus from their bodies, compared to those without gastrointestinal symptoms.",

For additional prevention tips, visit www.floridahealthcovid19.gov/prevention FDA Warns Consumers of Risk of Methanol Contamination in Certain Hand Sanitizers FDA is warning consumers and health care providers that the agency has seen a sharp increase in hand sanitizer products that are labeled to contain ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol) but that have tested positive for methanol contamination. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a substance that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin or ingested and can be life-threatening when ingested. Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate treatment for potential reversal of toxic effects of methanol poisoning. Substantial methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although all persons using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who accidently ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute, are most at risk. FDA recommends consumers stop using these hand sanitizers and dispose of them immediately in appropriate hazardous waste containers. Do not flush or pour these products down the drain. FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA\u2019s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program. Complete and submit the report online or download and complete the form , then submit it via fax at 1-800-FDA-0178.

Because many businesses have been closed during the COVID-19 State of Emergency, water has not been used and has remained in meter-to-building pipes for several weeks. The CDC and regulatory agencies advise that stagnant or standing water may cause conditions that increase the risk for the growth and spread of Legionella and other biofilm-associated bacteria. This advisory includes hot and cold-water systems, cooling towers, hot tubs, pools, spas, water heaters as well as decorative fountains. Following the Centers\u2019 for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines may greatly reduce chances for Legionella and other opportunistic waterborne microbes from developing within plumbing systems and devices. Businesses owners with questions regarding the CDC recommendations regarding water systems may call the Florida Department of Health at 305-324-2400.

The steps are designed to help guide state and local officials when reopening their economies, getting people back to work, and continuing to protect American lives. The plan focuses on a phased approach to reopening the country once criteria is met that includes: seeing a decrease in symptoms and reported COVID-19 cases over a sustained 14-day period; confirming that hospitals are no longer operating in crisis care mode; and having a robust testing system in place. The plan offers state and local officials the flexibility to take local circumstances into consideration when applying the criteria (e.g., metropolitan areas that have suffered severe COVID outbreaks, rural and suburban areas where outbreaks have not occurred or have been mild). In addition, Governors are encouraged to work on a regional basis to satisfy the criteria and progress through the phases of the reopening plan. For details, visit www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica.

For the latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the coronavirus, visit www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019. General Information  How Does Coronavirus Spread? Coronavirus can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, including when an individual coughs or sneezes. These droplets may land on objects and surfaces. Other people may contract Coronavirus by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. Symptoms of Coronavirus Symptoms of Coronavirus may appear within two to 14 days after exposure and include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Prevention The CDC recommends taking everyday preventive actions, including: Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then throw the tissue in the trash immediately. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. If you have fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, please seek medical attention.

Baby Masks Are Dangerous Twitter sounded the alarm on masks for very young children over the weekend. In response to an Amazon ad for Jonigo breathable gauze masks for children 0\u20133 years old, pediatric physician assistant Alyson Smith tweeted, \"Hey @Amazon this product could be deadly to babies and must be removed immediately.\" Hey @Amazon this product could be deadly to babies and must be removed immediately.@CDCgov and @AmerAcadPeds say no masks under age 2 due to high risk of suffocation. Reported via @AmazonHelp chat last week but product is still up.#COVID19 #Pediatrics https://t.co/QNPDr5DNxQ pic.twitter.com/qSDKXDngDG \u2014 Alyson Smith (@PedsAly) April 26, 2020 Smith and other users stress that both the Centers for Disease and Prevention Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommend against masks for small children, especially babies, because of the high risk for suffocation. She complained to the Amazon help center, and it appears the masks, along with similar products, have been removed from the site. However, baby masks are still readily available on numerous other websites. Protective face masks for kids may be a tempting purchase for parents, especially since there has been an increase in reports of severe gastrointestinal distress and cardiac inflammation in pediatric coronavirus patients. The characteristic COVID-19 symptoms of cough, fever, and shortness of breath are less common in children than adults, according to the CDC. COVID Could Be a Setback for Women in Medicine Early data suggest that women are losing out when it comes to journal submissions related to the new coronavirus. Social distancing shrinks the amount of time women can devote to research, Elizabeth Hannon, PhD, the deputy editor of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, explained on Twitter. She noted that she had received \"negligible\" submissions from women within the past month and that she had \"never seen anything like it.\" Negligible number of submissions to the journal from women in the last month. Never seen anything like it. \u2014 Elizabeth Hannon (@El_Dritch) April 18, 2020 \"This is a precursor to a disastrous backslide for academic women in era of #COVID19....\" responded Vineet Arora, MD, the chief medical officer at University Chicago Medicine. She cited the possibility of more layoffs of female staff, owing to pending budget cuts, and fewer promotions, grants, and tenured positions for women during the COVID-19 pandemic. These developments could reverse the gains women have made in medicine over the past 20 years, she added.",

                              "text": "Operator: Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to inform all participants that your lines have been placed on a listen only mode until the question and answer session of today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s call is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Benjamin Haynes. Sir, you may begin. Benjamin Haynes: Thank you Sue. And thank you all for joining us for today\u2019s briefing to update you on CDC\u2019s 2019 novel coronavirus response. We are joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who will give open remarks before taking your questions. I will now like to turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Thank you for joining us. Today, I would like to provide a few updates on important developments over the last few days. First, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the American who died in China over the weekend. As far as we know, this is the first American to die from this new coronavirus. Though more than a thousand people in China have died. My sympathy and my thanks go to the people of China, for those who have lost loved ones and those who are on the front lines battling this virus. In China, they are taking aggressive measures just as we are in the United States. Since we briefed you last, there has been one new confirmed novel coronavirus infection detected in the United States. The new confirmed infection is an individual who returned from Wuhan and was quarantined at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. This individual was on one of the last Department of State flights out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in China. Given the spread of the virus in Wuhan, it is not surprising to see a positive case among people who recently returned from there. That is in fact the reason they are being quarantined. Currently the person has mild illness but is hospitalized. This brings the total number of confirmed positives in the United States to 13. I want to clarify some of the reports that have been circulating about this case. Last Thursday when one of the planes from Wuhan landed at Miramar, a few people were sick and transported to local hospitals for further evaluation. These people were placed in isolation and samples were taken for testing. When running laboratory diagnostics for any disease, anywhere in the world, the ability to match the individual to the specimen is key, and is part of the normal procedures put in place to ensure that that matching is done correctly. But in this situation with this patient, it didn\u2019t work correctly, and the patient was misidentified initially as negative. The issue was identified within 24 hours. The CDC tested the sample, the positive result was conveyed quickly to the local public health and CDC teams. The mishap was unfortunate, but we have corrected this from happening again in the future by adding additional quality control. And it\u2019s really important to emphasize that during this time appropriate infection control precautions were taken around everyone, including around this patient who, again, is doing well. Now I\u2019d also like to update you on our diagnostic test kits. As you know, this is a dynamic, rapidly evolving situation, and our response continues to be based on the latest science. We continue to be flexible to meet the public health challenges that the virus presents, and clearly a success is the CDC rapid development of a diagnostic and rapid deployments to the states, which was clearly important to try to bring the testing closer to patients to avoid delays that have been inherent in sending samples to CDC. When the state receives these test kits, their procedure is to do quality control themselves in their own laboratories. Again, that is part of the normal procedures, but in doing it, some of the states identified some inconclusive laboratory results. We are working closely with them to correct the issues and as we\u2019ve said all along, speed is important, but equally or more important in this situation is making sure that the laboratory results are correct. During a response like this, we know things may not always go as smoothly as we would like. We have multiple levels of quality control to detect issues just like this one. We\u2019re looking into all of these issues to understand what went wrong, and to prevent these same things from happening in the future. Before I take questions, I want to give you a couple more updates. Since the airport screening began in mid-January, CDC and its partners have screened more than 30,000 passengers from China. With the temporary restrictions on travel, we are seeing fewer and fewer travelers from China, especially from Hubei province. Passengers are being funneled through 11 airports, most of these people are coming from parts of mainland China outside of Hubei, show no symptoms and have not been assessed as high risk. Those who passed the screening continue on to their final destination where they self-monitor their health for 14 days in cooperation with their state and local health departments. We\u2019re asking these people to limit their activities and stay home during that 14-day period. Our goal is to be as least restrictive as possible while ensuring the safety and health of all Americans. Since starting our travel restrictions and funneling through airports, we have not detected any cases among returning travelers from China. Most of the U.S. cases were found before the travel restrictions were put in place among travelers who returned from Wuhan and later sought medical care for their illnesses. These cases were picked up by astute clinicians and reported to CDC. We are continually reassessing our recommendations around quarantine and self-monitoring and will continue to work with state and local public health departments to refine and improve this process. Most of the diseases in China, however, we can and should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold in the U.S. The goal of the measures we have taken to date are to slow the introduction and impact of this disease in the United States but at some point, we are likely to see community spread in the U.S. Or other countries and this will trigger a change in our response strategy. This will require the effort of all levels of Government, the public health system and our communities as we face these challenges together. We are focusing now on preparing in other areas, including development of guidance for our health care practitioners, and planning for increased demand on our health care system. One important aspect of this is taking steps to make sure there are enough supplies and appropriate guidance to prevent the spread of the disease, especially among health care personnel caring for patients. We understand the importance of providing guidance that health care facilities can implement given the availability of personal protective equipment or PPE supplies. CDC talks regularly with health care industry partners as well as PPE manufacturers and distributors to assess availability of PPE. At this time, some partners are reporting higher than usual demand for select N95 respirators and face masks. CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public. This virus is not spreading in the community. If you are sick or a patient under investigation and not hospitalized, CDC recommends wearing a face mask when around other people and before entering a health care provider\u2019s office, but when you are alone, in your home, you do not need to wear a mask. People who are in close contact with someone with novel coronavirus, for example, household contacts and care givers of people with known or suspected 2019, I\u2019m sorry, nCoV 2019, we should wear a face mask if they are in the same room as the patient and that patient is not able to wear a face mask. Health care personnel should wear PPE including respirators when caring for confirmed or possible nCoV patients because they\u2019re in direct contact with those patients which increases their risk of exposure. We will continue to work with our public health partners around the clock to address this public health threat. Some good news this week is that yesterday the first group of 195 people who returned from Wuhan on a State Department flight completed their 14-day quarantine. None of those people have this new virus, and all left March Air Reserve Base successfully and happily returned along the way to their families and their communities. It\u2019s important that people understand that these people being released from quarantine pose no health threat to the surrounding communities or the community that they will be returned to. I want to extend my thanks to them for their cooperation and patience during the quarantine and wish them well as they return to home, work and school. I also want to thank the men and women on March Air Reserve Base and their families for their graciousness while hosting these guests. I also want to say that CDC is working in close collaboration with Japanese health authorities to ensure precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of disease on the Diamond Princess cruise ship as well as making sure the American citizens on that cruise ship are safe. We recognize the continued uncertainty of the current situation. As always CDC public health experts strive to make the best recommendations based on the most up-to-date data. I would be happy to take questions now. Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In order to provide everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow up. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself back into the queue and your additional questions will be answered as time permits. To ask a question, please press star followed by one. Please ensure your phone is unmuted and record your name clearly when prompted. Again, that is star followed by 1 to ask a question. If you need to withdraw your request press star 2. One moment for the first question. Our first question is from Richard Harris with NPR. You may go ahead. Richard Harris: Thanks very much. I have a point of clarification and then a question. And my clarification is based on your description of what happened with the test mix up, it sound as though somebody was misidentified as being positive and this person was misidentified as being negative, right, and then you realized that you had the identities wrong and you switched them. I want to make sure that I understand that. Let me ask my question also, which is a little more in-the-weeds, but I\u2019m interested to know what the status is of being able to have a stereological test to identify people who have been exposed but haven\u2019t shown signs of disease. Where is that right now? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: The answer of the first question is thanks for asking me to clarify because no, that is not exactly right. Because of the problem with identification of the patient, the initial run didn\u2019t include that. You know, as you can imagine, at CDC, there are a large number of specimens being processed, coming in and out, and it\u2019s important that they be identified appropriately so that they\u2019re prioritized. Because of the way that sample was identified, it wasn\u2019t run in that first run. Therefore, it was when the second run was done that we found that it was positive, so it isn\u2019t that somebody else was identified as positive. The sample wasn\u2019t initially run. And the answer to your second question is clearly a stereological test is important in the United States we want to be able to look to see if people zero converted but especially hopefully we\u2019ll be able to help the Chinese look. That test would be really helpful to be able to understand the spectrum of illness that is are there people who are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic that have stereological evidence of being exposed to pathogens. We have the beginnings of the stereological tests, because we now have patients in the United States, we\u2019re able to collect additional specimens but we have to collect them over time so that we can have the appropriate timing of specimens to make sure that we understand what the immune response looks like. Once we complete the gathering of those specimens from the patients we\u2019ll be able to pretty rapidly, I would say within a couple of weeks, three weeks, four weeks, be able to have a test available but right now, we\u2019re still in the range of testing of gathering the appropriate specimens from the patients in the U.S. Next question. Operator: thank you, the next question is from Ivan Couronne with \u201cAFP,\u201d you may go ahead. Ivan Couronne: Thank you. Have any of the test kits already been actually shipped outside of the U.S.? And if so, which country? Operator: One moment, please stand by. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I\u2019m here. Thank you, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t get off mute, so excuse me. We have shipped the test kit internationally. I don\u2019t have the specific list of countries in front of me. On last count and this is a couple of days ago, it was somewhere more than 30 countries. It\u2019s important to recognize that this is part of a normal procedure that CDC uses for exactly this kind of reason, to get help make test kits available to other countries who may not have easy access to the same reagents and resources that CDC does, so it\u2019s test kits and each of those countries that are receiving it will go through the same procedures that the recipients in the U.S. are, which is they would do an internal validation verification process before they\u2019d be using those kits, so I also don\u2019t know yet, and we can follow up on this whether any country that has received the kits has gone through that process yet, and whether countries have actually used it. I just don\u2019t have that in front of me. Next question. Operator: Thank you, the next question is from Hillary Bourke with \u201cBusiness Insider,\u201d you may go ahead. Hillary Bourke: Yeah, thanks for taking my call. I had a question about the incubation period. I\u2019m wondering what you think about the new paper that suggests it\u2019s possible the virus might incubate for as long as 24 days in some cases. Have you seen any evidence to support that idea so far? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Yeah, so, it\u2019s a really interesting report that has come out. As you can imagine, there is a lot of data coming out and a lot of scientists appropriately are rushing to make sure that any data that they have is in the public realm where all the rest of the scientific community can make use of it. I applaud everyone\u2019s efforts. We have seen in some situations the rush to get data published hasn\u2019t necessarily led to there being the usual level of oversight to make sure that each of the findings is quality controlled, frankly. So, we\u2019re looking at that data closely, but we\u2019re frankly looking at all the other data that\u2019s available that looks at incubation periods. I would say the incubation period is obviously really important for us as we look to make sure that we\u2019re releasing these people safely from quarantine, but the abundance of data, that is available still is consistent with our current stance, which is to use 14 days as the end of that incubation period. I also would say that this is a confusing situation because there may be patients that have mild or even asymptomatic disease that isn\u2019t recognized and when you look at incubation period, you\u2019re starting at the point where a patient is exposed and then counting the days until that patient mounts symptoms. But if there is widespread community spread, for example, it may be that some of those initial exposures aren\u2019t detected and it makes it hard to be sure about the actual incubation period. Our CDC staff there actually are something like 50 separate modeling groups in the United States that are working with us on exactly these issues. It\u2019s important that we work with all of these modelers because they have different symptoms than we do, but we\u2019re working with all of the greatest minds in the country and globally try to pin down these facts as much as we can, and we still think that for today, for now, 14 days is the right interval to use. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mike Stobbe with the \u201cAssociated Press,\u201d you may go ahead. Mike stobbe: Hi, thank you for taking my call. My initial question is I need to ask about this, the reports out of China, the cases reported dropped down significantly the last couple of days. I know it\u2019s just two days, but they were in the 3,000 range and now they\u2019re 2,478 and 2,050, that dropped, what if anything do you make of that, and my follow-up question is about you discussed the kits going out to the states, could you say a little more about did kits go to all 50 states and were you expecting that they\u2019d be up and running this week but now it means it\u2019s going to be two weeks from now. Could you help us better understand the impact of what\u2019s going on and what kind of delay it entails, thank you. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Sure. It\u2019s only two questions this time. Good. So, the Chinese cases dropping down, I\u2019m going to be optimistic that that is a sign that their aggressive efforts have been effective, but I really do think it\u2019s too soon to say that for sure, not having hands on the data ourselves. There is a WHO advanced team in China now, and I\u2019m hopeful that they will have access to the data themselves and be able to validate those findings. It would certainly be reassuring if we were now seeing at least a slowdown of this outbreak in China. So that\u2019s the first question. The second question is a little complicated but what I would say is that of course we hoped that everything would go smoothly as we rushed through this, you know. We moved quickly, that\u2019s appropriate under these circumstances but it\u2019s equally appropriate to do quality control which is what we do, and where these \u2014 where this issue was caught, it is part of the normal procedures. Of course, I hoped that this week every state \u2014 and every state did receive a kit \u2014 every state would be up and running. How long is it going to take? I can\u2019t tell you that for sure because I understand that not every state has completed their verification yet. And it won\u2019t be until we have results from every state that we know which states can continue and which states we need to \u2014 we need to get new reagents to. We\u2019re working closely with FDA. Again, we do expect this week that some states may move forward. Other states may need to get additional reagents from CDC, and I don\u2019t have an estimate yet from our laboratory staff as to how long that takes, and when we do, we will definitely be, first, letting the states know and then letting you all know. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Denise Grady with \u201cNew York times.\u201d You may go ahead. Denise Grady: Hi, thank you very much. I\u2019ll ask you both questions. One is could you please go over the criteria, so we understand exactly who is being tested, who\u2019s qualified for testing and then if the result is negative, does it mean anything? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to just pause because there\u2019s an ambulance going through. Just wait. Okay. So, let\u2019s see, the criteria for testing in the United States focuses on people who are ill with the spectrum of symptoms that we have associated with this, which is fever, respiratory symptoms, cough, shortness of breath who have had appropriate travel history or who have been identified as contacts of a confirmed patient. And so, in each of the states where these cases have been identified, we\u2019ve been looking at potential contacts of patients as to look to see if it spread, that contact tracing did identify the two cases that we say weren\u2019t directly associated with travel. Those are in close contacts of two patients who traveled but outside of those close contacts around confirmed cases, our focus right now is on people who have a travel history that is consistent with where this outbreak is spreading. And we\u2019re comfortable with that as the basic criteria because so far, we are not seeing widespread community spread in the United States. That is that the cases we\u2019re seeing are all directly linked with travel to Hubei and China. It is also true that we did some testing of asymptomatic people, but it wasn\u2019t in the setting of trying to make a clinical diagnosis. It was in the setting of using that to try to learn more about how this is being spread, and I think people may have misunderstood it. We did that in the first 195 people who were repatriated into the United States, but we have not been testing asymptomatic people who have returned on the other repatriation flights. And that relates to this question of what being negative means. If we have a patient who is symptomatic and has the right travel history, a negative means that at least at that point we don\u2019t think they have disease. If a patient is at very high risk in clinical discussions with their health care provider and health department, they may be tested again. If they\u2019re at very high risk. But in general, in a symptomatic patient, a negative, we think means that they\u2019re negative. The difference is that when we were using it at march air force base to learn more about how this was being spread, it is possible that someone could be negative and still be incubating the virus and therefore we, in that setting, didn\u2019t judge a negative to let us be confident that somebody was able to be released from quarantine. So that\u2019s the distinction that we\u2019re making. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Julie Steenhuysen with \u201cReuters,\u201d you may go ahead. Julie Steenhuysen: Thanks, I have a couple of questions. First off, we know now that the w.h.o. Has a team in China. Are you \u2014 are any representatives from the CDC a part of that team? And can you say a little bit more about what kinds of problems the state labs encountered in validating the tests and why you need to send new reagents and finally are there any more flights expected from China carrying U.S. citizens? Thanks. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Okay. The advance team is three WHO staff. They\u2019re staff that are well known to us. They have a lot of experience. They are being articulated as an advance team, and I heard a report from them this morning. They\u2019re getting access to data, and doing the things you would expect them to do and as you all know, CDC stands ready to send staff to the affected areas in China to work on this investigation and as soon as we\u2019re given the invitation, we are happy to do that, but we haven\u2019t been invited yet. More planes, I think there is continued conversation that Americans who are still in Wuhan or other parts of China, so those conversations are ongoing, and I don\u2019t have any specific information right now as to whether there will be additional folks repatriated in groups like we saw with these planes. So, I don\u2019t have any specific information on that. In terms of the test problems, it gets a little weedy, but I can give you a little more detail. When a state gets the test kits, they have to verify that it works the same in their lab that it worked at CDC. And when some states were doing this, we received feedback that they weren\u2019t \u2014 that it wasn\u2019t working as expected, specifically some public health labs at states were getting inconclusive results and what that means is that test results were not coming back as false positive or false negatives, but they were being read as inconclusive. Now, these were not tests being run on actual clinical specimens from potential patients. These were part of the verification process, and because of that we are \u2014 when we evaluated what the issue is, we think that there might be an issue with one of the three assays and we think that maybe one of the reagents wasn\u2019t performing consistently, so it\u2019s a long story to say that we think that the issue at the states can be explained by one reagent that isn\u2019t performing as it should consistently and that\u2019s why we are re-manufacturing that reagent, obviously a state wouldn\u2019t want to be doing this test and using it to make clinical decisions if it isn\u2019t working as well as perfectly at the state as it is at CDC, so this is part of a normal process and procedure and redoing the manufacturing is the next step. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Erika Edwards with NBC news. You may go ahead. Erika Edwards: Yeah, just to follow up on that, are all the tests still coming through the CDC in Atlanta for conclusive results while the states work out their issues? And separately, I just wanted to learn more about your thoughts on that growing number of cases on the cruise ship docked in japan. I mean, is there anything that CDC is even able to do to help the Americans on board? Thanks. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Yeah, thanks for the clarification and yes, all clinical specimens are still being sent to CDC for validation. I think you would expect nothing less from us as obviously the results of this test are so meaningful, and we\u2019ll continue to provide that backstopping frankly even after states are up and running. I would ask that you \u2014 that the right language wouldn\u2019t be a problem with the states. It\u2019s a collective problem, so I don\u2019t want this to be seen as something that the states are doing incorrectly. That is certainly not the situation here. This is really part of a normal process and procedure, and, you know, we have the quality control set up specifically to allow us to identify these kinds of problems. In terms of the cruise ship, I know that there are Americans on board, there are certainly Americans that are ill and it\u2019s certainly concerning the high number of cases on that cruise ship. We are working closely with the embassy in japan, and the state department to help with thinking through what\u2019s the right actions. Somebody from the state department may be on the phone, and if so, I\u2019ll ask them if they want to make a comment on this. Ben, is somebody there? Benjamin Haynes: No, Nancy, sorry, nobody from \u2014 Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Okay. So, I guess they\u2019re probably not on the phone because they\u2019re helping \u2014 working with us to think through what to do. Obviously, it\u2019s a high priority to make sure that the people that are already sick or the people that are still on the ship and asymptomatic are getting the best care possible. We want to protect their health, and we\u2019re working closely, again, through the embassy on thinking through what the right next steps are, and when there\u2019s more information, we will clearly make that available as quickly as possible. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tom Howell with the \u201cWashington Times.\u201d You may go ahead. Tom Howell: Hi, thanks for doing the call. Just branching off the question about the cruise ship, do you have any numbers of how many Americans are on board and how many of them might be infected if any? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I actually don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me but what I would say is there are definitely Americans on board who have been diagnosed with and now I have to get this name right, nCoV 19. Excuse me for not getting it right. I\u2019m still working on it. There are Americans on board that have been diagnosed with nCoV 19, but I don\u2019t have the numbers on me right now, and we can certainly follow up. Next question. Operator: Thank you, the next question comes from Nate Wetzel with \u201cThe Hill,\u201d you may go ahead. Nate Wetzel: Hi, thanks for doing this call. I\u2019m just wondering, there have been reports that the virus might either weaken or sort of die out as the weather gets warmer. Do you have any evidence for that? Has that been officially confirmed? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: So, I think I would caution overinterpreting that hypothesis. I think what folks are saying, which I think is a valid point is that most viral respiratory diseases are seasonal, and we\u2019ll use as an example influenza. Influenza has a season. It can alter a little bit but it\u2019s generally, we know what time of year is going to be the peak of influenza and in general, as we head towards spring and summer, we expect the cases of influenza in the United States to fall off. That\u2019s true for other viral respiratory diseases also that have a winter season. So, if this behaves similarly, it may be that as we head towards summer and, I guess, spring and summer, the cases would go down, but this is a new disease. We haven\u2019t even been through six weeks of it, much less a year, and so I certainly would, I mean, I\u2019m happy to hope that it goes down as the weather warms up, but I think it\u2019s premature to assume that, and we\u2019re certainly not using that to sit back and expect it to go away. The aggressive actions were taken or we\u2019re taking are because we don\u2019t think we can count on that since again, we haven\u2019t been through even a single year with this pathogen. Next question. Benjamin Haynes: Sue, we have time for one more question, please. Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Steve Baragona with \u201cvoice of America,\u201d you may go ahead. Steve Baragona: Hi, thanks for doing the call. You mentioned a couple of times about information you\u2019re getting from the Chinese. I know that\u2019s been an issue throughout this outbreak. How is your access to data? Are you getting all the information you need, and if not, what\u2019s the hold up? What impact does that have on your ability to respond? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I\u2019m happy to talk about this. I\u2019ll start by saying there\u2019s nothing really new in this space compared to what we have said previously. There has been a lot more data coming out of China in the recent weeks, compared to perhaps from the very beginning, and there have been meetings, for example, hosted by w.h.o. Where Chinese authorities have presented their data. As an epidemiologist seeing a graph that somebody else produced is never as good as touching the data yourself. Being able to look at it yourself and being able to ask the questions and run the data directly, so having that distance from the actual ongoing investigation in China or anywhere is never the best way for us to be able to be completely confident that we understand the situation. That is the \u2014 part of the reason that we want to have folks on the ground. I\u2019m working specifically on this investigation, the other is that I would say that CDC scientists are certainly some of the best in the world and our scientists have a lot to offer in terms of looking at what\u2019s going on right now in terms of the analysis. We also find that when you\u2019re in the midst of doing an investigation yourself, sometimes it\u2019s hard to step back and folks coming from outside who haven\u2019t been so enmeshed in the day-to-day sometimes can pick up things you didn\u2019t think of or have a different perspective. That\u2019s the other reason that it would be helpful to have a broader set of folks being able to look at the data itself. I have nothing new to say in terms of the data coming out. There is more coming out in the published literature but CDC staff themselves haven\u2019t yet gained direct access to the data and we continue to be hopeful that we\u2019ll be invited to do that. Thank you. Benjamin Haynes: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier, and thank you all for joining us for today\u2019s briefing. Please check CDC\u2019s 2019 novel coronavirus web site for the latest updates on CDC\u2019s response efforts and if you have further questions, please call the main media line at 404-639-3286 or e-mail media@cdc.gov, thank you.

                              "text": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: I have significant pollen allergies and asthma. In the spring, I usually have sneezing, coughing and an occasional sore throat that coincides with the trees blooming. With COVID-19 concerns, I am wondering if I am at any increased risk for the virus or need to be concerned that I should be tested? ANSWER: Certainly, in many parts of the U.S., spring is in full bloom. And with the arrival of spring comes an increase in seasonal allergies, often to the pollen that is produced by trees. Given the situation with COVID-19, many people have questions about increased risk of infection or complications from the virus. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that leads to symptoms such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing. Symptoms can range widely, from mild to severe. While the Centers for Disease Control states individuals with asthma may be at greater risk for infection with COVID-19, the Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology notes there is no data to substantiate that patients with allergies and asthma are at an increased risk COVID-19. Allergies, which affect millions of people, occur when a person's immune system reacts to a foreign substance, such as pollen, pet dander or certain foods. Asthma is a condition that causes airways to narrow and swell, and produce extra mucus. Though certain symptoms may overlap, allergies differ from COVID-19 with respect to the sudden onset of illness and symptoms. Typical seasonal allergy symptoms include itchy, watery eyes; itchy, runny nose; sneezing; nasal congestion; and postnasal drip. Though you might experience some of the same symptoms with a cold or other virus, COVID-19 symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and potentially some gastrointestinal upset. Though asthma can make breathing difficult, and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, if you are asthmatic, you would likely recognize an attack. But it would be unlikely that you would have a fever. COVID-19 symptoms tend to come on quickly and worsen. With allergy and asthma, a change of scenery and medication can easily help improve symptoms. If you have allergies or asthma, it is important to know your triggers and make accommodations, especially given the current stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines surrounding COVID-19. For example, if you are allergic to oak tree pollen, but have taken to running outdoors as opposed to in a gym, you may want to reduce your mileage and plan to shower immediately after you complete your exercise. If you know dust is a trigger for your asthma, be mindful to adjust your chore schedule to vacuum or mop more often. Also, continue to use your steroid inhalers and nasal sprays. Although there has been concern about these medications and their link to increasing the spread of COVID-19, there is no literature to substantiate this. The same is true for saline irrigation. The recommendations are to continue using your asthma and allergy medication, whether over-the-counter or prescription. For effectiveness, however, make sure you're using your nasal sprays properly. Avoid spraying your septum or nasal bone, which can thin the skin and cause bleeding. Rather, tilt the head down, shake the bottle and then aim toward the ear. Spray and sniff in slowly. Then shake the bottle and repeat in the other nostril. Also remember to wipe the nozzle down after each use and not share bottles with anyone else. If you find your current over-the-counter allergy medication is not working as effectively as you'd like, consider switching brands for a short time. Oftentimes, your body can build up a tolerance and the medication may become less effective at controlling your symptoms. Switching to another brand for a few weeks may help. If your symptoms worsen and you have concerns that you may have contracted COVID-19, you should contact your health care provider. Stay informed on COVID-19 and get your information from reliable sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Mayo Clinic.\u2014 Dr. Arveen Bhasin, Allergy and Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida For the latest updates on the COVID-19 pandemic, check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

                              "text": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: I have read that COVID-19 spreads from person to person, but can it also live on objects? Should I be concerned about catching the virus from things I buy at the grocery store or while filling up my car with gas? ANSWER: Your highest risk of catching COVID-19 is being exposed to a person ill with COVID-19. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that leads to symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. The virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when someone infected coughs or sneezes. If you breathe in the droplets, or they land on your eyes, nose or mouth, you are at risk of infection. You're also at risk if you touch a surface where the droplets have landed, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. At this time, expert estimates are that the virus may live on a surface anywhere from a few hours to up to nine days, depending on the type of surface, as well as the surrounding temperature and environment. When possible, disinfect surfaces in your house, in public spaces that you touch, and wash your hands thoroughly after being out in public. There are steps that you can take to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 from surfaces. In your home, clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces routinely, including doorknobs, light switches, faucets, countertops, tables, toilets and sinks. Household cleaners and disinfectants that you can buy in your local stores work well. Wash your hands when you're done. When you're out in public, many stores provide disinfectant wipes to use on carts and baskets. Wipe the handles of those items before you use them. You may want to consider carrying a small supply of disinfecting wipes with you to use if they are not provided in a store, or to use on surfaces, such as gasoline pumps, where wipes are less likely to be nearby. Use an alcohol-based wipe rather than baby wipes, which may not be effective at getting rid of the virus. While items you buy at the grocery store could harbor COVID-19 if someone who's infected coughs or sneezes on them, the overall risk is low. And it isn't practical to disinfect each item you purchase, although you should continue to wash all produce thoroughly before you eat it. Instead, wash your hands after you return home from the grocery store or any other public space. As an extra precaution, wash them again after you've put all your grocery items away. Both washing your hands with soap and water and using hand sanitizer are good options. To effectively wash your hands, first get them wet with clean, running water. Apply soap and lather well. Rub your hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Remember to scrub all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, your thumbs, wrists, between your fingers and under your fingernails. Rinse well and dry your hands with a clean towel, or let them air-dry. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol. Use enough hand sanitizer that it takes about 15 seconds for it to dry with rubbing. To further reduce your risk of catching the virus, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, particularly when you're out in public or if your hands are not clean. As you think about ways to stay healthy, keep in mind that guidance regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is ever-changing.

Dr. Clayton Cowl, chair of Mayo Clinic's Division of Preventive, Occupational and Aerospace Medicine, says symptoms can come on rapidly. These symptoms can be especially dangerous for people over 70; immunosuppressed people; and those with underlying conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease and diabetes. Dr. Cowl says that many people who contract the disease will have mild or no symptoms. But if they develop symptoms, when and how should they seek medical help? Should they get tested? Dr. Cowl says the first things that you should do are remain at home, drink plenty of fluids and take a fever-reducing medication. If symptoms intensify, call your health care provider, local hospital or clinic. \"It really is important to emphasize that, unless is it a medical emergency, you should not go in to the hospital or visit your health care provider without at least calling first,\" says Dr. Cowl. \"By calling first, you can avoid exposing yourself and others to the virus. And you can help prevent an overflow situation at the medical facility.\" Watch Dr. Cowl discuss what to do if you suspect COVID-19. Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites with Dr. Cowl are in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy \"Clayton Cowl, M.D., Preventive, Occupational and Aerospace Medicine, Mayo Clinic.\" Symptoms of COVID-19 Shortness of breath Cough Fever Fatigue Muscle aches \"Symptoms of COVID-19 are typically myalgia, or muscle aches, and a lot of fatigue. Usually it's associated with a fever. Sometimes it's low-grade from 100.3 F to perhaps higher. Some people experience much higher fever that go up to 102 F or 103F. Individuals may experience some shortness of breath. They may experience cough. And it can either be a dry cough, or they may cough up phlegm.\" When to seek help The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that if you think you have been exposed to COVID-19, and you develop symptoms such as a cough, fever and shortness of breath, you should call your health care provider. If you are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19 but do not have symptoms, Dr. Cowl says you do not need to be tested. You should self-monitor for symptoms that may develop and use good hand hygiene. He adds that since the COVID-19 situation is evolving, experts are learning more about the virus every day. Recommendations for testing also may change. \"Right now, the recommendation is if you're asymptomatic, you do not need to be tested,\" says Dr. Cowl. \"Part of that is because the number of testing kits needed are not available. But, clinically, if you're asymptomatic, no test.\" Dr. Cowl emphasizes that if you think you may have COVID-19, call your healthcare provider first, rather than showing up without warning. But if you experience more severe symptoms, seek emergency medical care.

Therefore, those with RA who develop COVID-19 may be at higher risk for developing severe symptoms and additional complications. FDA NOTICE The FDA have removed the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on a review of the latest research, the FDA determined that these drugs are not likely to be an effective treatment for COVID-19 and that the risks of using them for this purpose might outweigh any benefits. Treatment options for RA may also affect the immune system, increasing the risk further. However, in most cases, doctors do not recommend abruptly stopping any treatments for RA, as this may lead to a flare. The best way to reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 is by staying home (shelter-in-place), and maintaining consistent infection prevention habits to inhibit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease. Keep reading to learn more about how COVID-19 may affect a person with RA, including what current research says, the risks, and the precautions people should take. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. How does COVID-19 affect people with RA? Share on Pinterest As a person with RA has an impaired immune system, they may be at higher risk of developing COVID-19. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the lining of the joints. Autoimmune conditions, such as RA, compromise the immune system, in varying degrees of severity. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other expert bodies are still investigating the impact of the novel coronavirus on people with preexisting conditions. Some research published in Autoimmunity Reviews suggests that people with RA have an increased risk of contracting the virus due to their impaired immune system. Factors that can affect the vulnerability of someone with RA include medication, age, and other health conditions. Treatments for RA, including corticosteroids and drugs that modify or suppress the immune system, may increase the risk of infection. The British Society for Rheumatology created a risk scoring guide chart to clarify the potential level of risk that someone with RA may be at. Is COVID-19 dangerous for people with RA? According to the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance Global Registry, which supplies live-time information regarding rheumatic diseases and COVID-19, people with RA may be at higher risk for infection and developing severe symptoms. This may be truer for people with very high disease activity, people who have trouble controlling their symptoms, or those with other health conditions. A person with RA who also has other risk factors, such as being over 65, living in a long-term care facility, or having another medical condition, may be at a higher risk for severe illness. Additionally, people with RA who take certain drugs, such as immunosuppressant drugs, to control symptoms may be more at risk for infections or complications from those infections. However, people should not stop, change the dosage of, or take a new medication or supplement without contacting their doctor. Currently, there is not much formal evidence connecting COVID-19 and RA. Symptoms to look out for The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that the most common symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, a dry cough, and shortness of breath. These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after infection. A report from the WHO also notes that other symptoms may include: fatigue extra mucus production a sore throat severe headache chills nausea or vomiting nasal congestion diarrhea The CDC also include the loss of taste and smell as a symptom of COVID-19 In some cases, a COVID-19 infection can cause aches and pains in the joints. This pain may mimic the pain of RA or make RA seem worse. Additionally, people who are at risk should pay especially close attention to the emergency warning signs of a COVID-19 infection. According to the CDC, emergency warning signs include: difficulty breathing constant pressure or pain in the chest New sensations of confusion or an inability to arouse A bluish hue in the skin of the face or lips Anyone experiencing the emergency signs of COVID-19 infection should seek medical attention immediately. Extra care and precautions required People with RA should take extra care to prevent their exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In general, the CDC recommend that people who are at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and avoid close contact with others. Several general practices can also help to reduce the spread of the virus. General prevention tips include: staying home whenever possible washing the hands regularly with warm water and soap, lathering for at least 20 seconds coating the hands in an alcohol-based sanitizer when soap is not available regularly disinfecting frequently used surfaces, such as countertops, keyboards, and phones practicing physical distancing if a person needs to go out, staying at least 6 feet away from others while in public, and wearing a mask avoiding contact with people who are sick in any way keeping supplies of food and medication to hand so the person has access to them if they need to quarantine avoiding public areas, such as public restrooms and public transportation avoiding all non-essential travel Additionally, the CDC now recommend that people wear cloth masks while in public as an additional step to slow the spread of the virus. Medications People with RA should take steps to ensure they have access to their medicines. Anyone who relies on drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, to treat RA should talk to their doctor or pharmacist about ensuring their access to treatment. People with RA should not slow or stop any treatments they are taking without their doctor\u2019s permission. This includes medication s that may suppress the immune system, such as biologics or DMARDs. Stopping taking a medication may cause a flare-up, which can put more stress on the body. However, sometimes a doctor may recommend that a person takes reduced doses of immunosuppressant medication and lengthens the intervals between infusions. Some people have voiced concerns over the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control symptoms. However, the Arthritis Foundation note that there is no clear evidence that using NSAIDs will increase a person\u2019s risk of developing COVID-19 or that they will experience more significant adverse effects from the disease should they contract it. People who rely on any of these medications to manage RA should talk to their doctor to asses their specific risks. Treatment and symptom management There is currently no direct treatment for COVID-19. Treatment will largely vary on the severity of the illness and the symptoms a person has. People who only experience mild to moderate symptoms may be able to manage the illness in their homes. However, people must work closely with their doctors to monitor symptoms and potential treatments. People with severe symptoms may require hospitalization to treat symptoms and complications. Treatments will vary in each case based on the complications. Some people with severe complications may require oxygen supplementation to help them get enough oxygen into their lungs. Others may require mechanical respiration if their lungs begin to fail. What to do if test positive Anyone who tests positive for SARS-Cov2 should work closely with their doctor to discuss and implement any treatments necessary to manage symptoms. A public health professional may also assist in tracing others they have been in contact with. This is known as contact-tracing. A person who tests positive for the novel coronavirus should self-isolate. This means staying at home. Ideally, a person with COVID-19 should self-isolate in a room away from other family members, using a separate bathroom if possible. A person can leave the house to collect medicines if no one else can do it for them. Wear a mask, especially when leaving home. Prognosis A large report from the WHO notes that approximately 80% of confirmed COVID-19 cases experience mild to moderate symptoms. These infections may clear up at home, using over-the-counter or prescription drugs to manage symptoms. People who experience moderate to severe infections may require hospitalization. Treatments may include oxygen supplementation to keep enough oxygen in the lungs. In critically severe cases, the person may need mechanical ventilation to keep oxygen in the lungs. In the most severe cases, a person may experience organ failure and shock that could be life-threatening.",

But early research suggests that another common symptom may be often overlooked: stomach upset. A recent analysis of more than 200 people admitted to three hospitals in Hubei, China -- the province where the virus called SARS-CoV-2 originated -- with mild cases of COVID-19 found that almost 1 in 5 had at least one gastrointestinal symptom, such as diarrhea, vomiting, or belly pain. Nearly 80% also lacked an appetite. Those symptoms can stem from other common causes, including stomach flu or food poisoning. But if you have COVID-19, GI problems may slow your recovery. And the digestive symptoms may worsen as you get sicker. Gastrointestinal Link Once any virus infects your body, it can destroy healthy cells and make multiple copies of itself. COVID-19 mainly attacks the cells lining your airways. This makes it hard for you to breathe and can lead to pneumonia. But researchers think the illness also may harm your digestive tract and liver tissue. The study in China found that a third of the people with mild COVID-19 had diarrhea. The problem, including watery stool, was usually not severe. The diarrhea lasted for an average of 5 days. Those with digestive symptoms were more likely to have a positive stool test for the coronavirus, which means they had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their poop. It also took them longer to clear the virus from their bodies, compared to those without gastrointestinal symptoms.",

For additional prevention tips, visit www.floridahealthcovid19.gov/prevention FDA Warns Consumers of Risk of Methanol Contamination in Certain Hand Sanitizers FDA is warning consumers and health care providers that the agency has seen a sharp increase in hand sanitizer products that are labeled to contain ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol) but that have tested positive for methanol contamination. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a substance that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin or ingested and can be life-threatening when ingested. Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate treatment for potential reversal of toxic effects of methanol poisoning. Substantial methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although all persons using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who accidently ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute, are most at risk. FDA recommends consumers stop using these hand sanitizers and dispose of them immediately in appropriate hazardous waste containers. Do not flush or pour these products down the drain. FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA\u2019s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program. Complete and submit the report online or download and complete the form , then submit it via fax at 1-800-FDA-0178.

Because many businesses have been closed during the COVID-19 State of Emergency, water has not been used and has remained in meter-to-building pipes for several weeks. The CDC and regulatory agencies advise that stagnant or standing water may cause conditions that increase the risk for the growth and spread of Legionella and other biofilm-associated bacteria. This advisory includes hot and cold-water systems, cooling towers, hot tubs, pools, spas, water heaters as well as decorative fountains. Following the Centers\u2019 for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines may greatly reduce chances for Legionella and other opportunistic waterborne microbes from developing within plumbing systems and devices. Businesses owners with questions regarding the CDC recommendations regarding water systems may call the Florida Department of Health at 305-324-2400.

White House Unveils Plan to Reopen the Country President Trump has unveiled Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, a three-phased approach based on the advice of public health experts. The steps are designed to help guide state and local officials when reopening their economies, getting people back to work, and continuing to protect American lives. The plan focuses on a phased approach to reopening the country once criteria is met that includes: seeing a decrease in symptoms and reported COVID-19 cases over a sustained 14-day period; confirming that hospitals are no longer operating in crisis care mode; and having a robust testing system in place. The plan offers state and local officials the flexibility to take local circumstances into consideration when applying the criteria (e.g., metropolitan areas that have suffered severe COVID outbreaks, rural and suburban areas where outbreaks have not occurred or have been mild). In addition, Governors are encouraged to work on a regional basis to satisfy the criteria and progress through the phases of the reopening plan. For details, visit www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica.

Baby Masks Are Dangerous Twitter sounded the alarm on masks for very young children over the weekend. In response to an Amazon ad for Jonigo breathable gauze masks for children 0\u20133 years old, pediatric physician assistant Alyson Smith tweeted, \"Hey @Amazon this product could be deadly to babies and must be removed immediately.\" Hey @Amazon this product could be deadly to babies and must be removed immediately.@CDCgov and @AmerAcadPeds say no masks under age 2 due to high risk of suffocation. Reported via @AmazonHelp chat last week but product is still up.#COVID19 #Pediatrics https://t.co/QNPDr5DNxQ pic.twitter.com/qSDKXDngDG \u2014 Alyson Smith (@PedsAly) April 26, 2020 Smith and other users stress that both the Centers for Disease and Prevention Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommend against masks for small children, especially babies, because of the high risk for suffocation. She complained to the Amazon help center, and it appears the masks, along with similar products, have been removed from the site. However, baby masks are still readily available on numerous other websites. Protective face masks for kids may be a tempting purchase for parents, especially since there has been an increase in reports of severe gastrointestinal distress and cardiac inflammation in pediatric coronavirus patients. The characteristic COVID-19 symptoms of cough, fever, and shortness of breath are less common in children than adults, according to the CDC. COVID Could Be a Setback for Women in Medicine Early data suggest that women are losing out when it comes to journal submissions related to the new coronavirus. Social distancing shrinks the amount of time women can devote to research, Elizabeth Hannon, PhD, the deputy editor of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, explained on Twitter. She noted that she had received \"negligible\" submissions from women within the past month and that she had \"never seen anything like it.\" Negligible number of submissions to the journal from women in the last month. Never seen anything like it. \u2014 Elizabeth Hannon (@El_Dritch) April 18, 2020 \"This is a precursor to a disastrous backslide for academic women in era of #COVID19....\" responded Vineet Arora, MD, the chief medical officer at University Chicago Medicine. She cited the possibility of more layoffs of female staff, owing to pending budget cuts, and fewer promotions, grants, and tenured positions for women during the COVID-19 pandemic. These developments could reverse the gains women have made in medicine over the past 20 years, she added.",

At this time, I would like to inform all participants that your lines have been placed on a listen only mode until the question and answer session of today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s call is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Benjamin Haynes. Sir, you may begin. Benjamin Haynes: Thank you Sue. And thank you all for joining us for today\u2019s briefing to update you on CDC\u2019s 2019 novel coronavirus response. We are joined today by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who will give open remarks before taking your questions. I will now like to turn the call over to Dr. Messonnier. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Thank you for joining us. Today, I would like to provide a few updates on important developments over the last few days. First, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the American who died in China over the weekend. As far as we know, this is the first American to die from this new coronavirus. Though more than a thousand people in China have died. My sympathy and my thanks go to the people of China, for those who have lost loved ones and those who are on the front lines battling this virus. In China, they are taking aggressive measures just as we are in the United States. Since we briefed you last, there has been one new confirmed novel coronavirus infection detected in the United States. The new confirmed infection is an individual who returned from Wuhan and was quarantined at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. This individual was on one of the last Department of State flights out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in China. Given the spread of the virus in Wuhan, it is not surprising to see a positive case among people who recently returned from there. That is in fact the reason they are being quarantined. Currently the person has mild illness but is hospitalized. This brings the total number of confirmed positives in the United States to 13. I want to clarify some of the reports that have been circulating about this case. Last Thursday when one of the planes from Wuhan landed at Miramar, a few people were sick and transported to local hospitals for further evaluation. These people were placed in isolation and samples were taken for testing. When running laboratory diagnostics for any disease, anywhere in the world, the ability to match the individual to the specimen is key, and is part of the normal procedures put in place to ensure that that matching is done correctly. But in this situation with this patient, it didn\u2019t work correctly, and the patient was misidentified initially as negative. The issue was identified within 24 hours. The CDC tested the sample, the positive result was conveyed quickly to the local public health and CDC teams. The mishap was unfortunate, but we have corrected this from happening again in the future by adding additional quality control. And it\u2019s really important to emphasize that during this time appropriate infection control precautions were taken around everyone, including around this patient who, again, is doing well. Now I\u2019d also like to update you on our diagnostic test kits. As you know, this is a dynamic, rapidly evolving situation, and our response continues to be based on the latest science. We continue to be flexible to meet the public health challenges that the virus presents, and clearly a success is the CDC rapid development of a diagnostic and rapid deployments to the states, which was clearly important to try to bring the testing closer to patients to avoid delays that have been inherent in sending samples to CDC. When the state receives these test kits, their procedure is to do quality control themselves in their own laboratories. Again, that is part of the normal procedures, but in doing it, some of the states identified some inconclusive laboratory results. We are working closely with them to correct the issues and as we\u2019ve said all along, speed is important, but equally or more important in this situation is making sure that the laboratory results are correct. During a response like this, we know things may not always go as smoothly as we would like. We have multiple levels of quality control to detect issues just like this one. We\u2019re looking into all of these issues to understand what went wrong, and to prevent these same things from happening in the future. Before I take questions, I want to give you a couple more updates. Since the airport screening began in mid-January, CDC and its partners have screened more than 30,000 passengers from China. With the temporary restrictions on travel, we are seeing fewer and fewer travelers from China, especially from Hubei province. Passengers are being funneled through 11 airports, most of these people are coming from parts of mainland China outside of Hubei, show no symptoms and have not been assessed as high risk. Those who passed the screening continue on to their final destination where they self-monitor their health for 14 days in cooperation with their state and local health departments. We\u2019re asking these people to limit their activities and stay home during that 14-day period. Our goal is to be as least restrictive as possible while ensuring the safety and health of all Americans. Since starting our travel restrictions and funneling through airports, we have not detected any cases among returning travelers from China. Most of the U.S. cases were found before the travel restrictions were put in place among travelers who returned from Wuhan and later sought medical care for their illnesses. These cases were picked up by astute clinicians and reported to CDC. We are continually reassessing our recommendations around quarantine and self-monitoring and will continue to work with state and local public health departments to refine and improve this process. Most of the diseases in China, however, we can and should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold in the U.S. The goal of the measures we have taken to date are to slow the introduction and impact of this disease in the United States but at some point, we are likely to see community spread in the U.S. Or other countries and this will trigger a change in our response strategy. This will require the effort of all levels of Government, the public health system and our communities as we face these challenges together. We are focusing now on preparing in other areas, including development of guidance for our health care practitioners, and planning for increased demand on our health care system. One important aspect of this is taking steps to make sure there are enough supplies and appropriate guidance to prevent the spread of the disease, especially among health care personnel caring for patients. We understand the importance of providing guidance that health care facilities can implement given the availability of personal protective equipment or PPE supplies. CDC talks regularly with health care industry partners as well as PPE manufacturers and distributors to assess availability of PPE. At this time, some partners are reporting higher than usual demand for select N95 respirators and face masks. CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public. This virus is not spreading in the community. If you are sick or a patient under investigation and not hospitalized, CDC recommends wearing a face mask when around other people and before entering a health care provider\u2019s office, but when you are alone, in your home, you do not need to wear a mask. People who are in close contact with someone with novel coronavirus, for example, household contacts and care givers of people with known or suspected 2019, I\u2019m sorry, nCoV 2019, we should wear a face mask if they are in the same room as the patient and that patient is not able to wear a face mask. Health care personnel should wear PPE including respirators when caring for confirmed or possible nCoV patients because they\u2019re in direct contact with those patients which increases their risk of exposure. We will continue to work with our public health partners around the clock to address this public health threat. Some good news this week is that yesterday the first group of 195 people who returned from Wuhan on a State Department flight completed their 14-day quarantine. None of those people have this new virus, and all left March Air Reserve Base successfully and happily returned along the way to their families and their communities. It\u2019s important that people understand that these people being released from quarantine pose no health threat to the surrounding communities or the community that they will be returned to. I want to extend my thanks to them for their cooperation and patience during the quarantine and wish them well as they return to home, work and school. I also want to thank the men and women on March Air Reserve Base and their families for their graciousness while hosting these guests. I also want to say that CDC is working in close collaboration with Japanese health authorities to ensure precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of disease on the Diamond Princess cruise ship as well as making sure the American citizens on that cruise ship are safe. We recognize the continued uncertainty of the current situation. As always CDC public health experts strive to make the best recommendations based on the most up-to-date data. I would be happy to take questions now. Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In order to provide everyone the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow up. If you have further questions, simply reinsert yourself back into the queue and your additional questions will be answered as time permits. To ask a question, please press star followed by one. Please ensure your phone is unmuted and record your name clearly when prompted. Again, that is star followed by 1 to ask a question. If you need to withdraw your request press star 2. One moment for the first question. Our first question is from Richard Harris with NPR. You may go ahead. Richard Harris: Thanks very much. I have a point of clarification and then a question. And my clarification is based on your description of what happened with the test mix up, it sound as though somebody was misidentified as being positive and this person was misidentified as being negative, right, and then you realized that you had the identities wrong and you switched them. I want to make sure that I understand that. Let me ask my question also, which is a little more in-the-weeds, but I\u2019m interested to know what the status is of being able to have a stereological test to identify people who have been exposed but haven\u2019t shown signs of disease. Where is that right now? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: The answer of the first question is thanks for asking me to clarify because no, that is not exactly right. Because of the problem with identification of the patient, the initial run didn\u2019t include that. You know, as you can imagine, at CDC, there are a large number of specimens being processed, coming in and out, and it\u2019s important that they be identified appropriately so that they\u2019re prioritized. Because of the way that sample was identified, it wasn\u2019t run in that first run. Therefore, it was when the second run was done that we found that it was positive, so it isn\u2019t that somebody else was identified as positive. The sample wasn\u2019t initially run. And the answer to your second question is clearly a stereological test is important in the United States we want to be able to look to see if people zero converted but especially hopefully we\u2019ll be able to help the Chinese look. That test would be really helpful to be able to understand the spectrum of illness that is are there people who are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic that have stereological evidence of being exposed to pathogens. We have the beginnings of the stereological tests, because we now have patients in the United States, we\u2019re able to collect additional specimens but we have to collect them over time so that we can have the appropriate timing of specimens to make sure that we understand what the immune response looks like. Once we complete the gathering of those specimens from the patients we\u2019ll be able to pretty rapidly, I would say within a couple of weeks, three weeks, four weeks, be able to have a test available but right now, we\u2019re still in the range of testing of gathering the appropriate specimens from the patients in the U.S. Next question. Operator: thank you, the next question is from Ivan Couronne with \u201cAFP,\u201d you may go ahead. Ivan Couronne: Thank you. Have any of the test kits already been actually shipped outside of the U.S.? And if so, which country? Operator: One moment, please stand by. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I\u2019m here. Thank you, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t get off mute, so excuse me. We have shipped the test kit internationally. I don\u2019t have the specific list of countries in front of me. On last count and this is a couple of days ago, it was somewhere more than 30 countries. It\u2019s important to recognize that this is part of a normal procedure that CDC uses for exactly this kind of reason, to get help make test kits available to other countries who may not have easy access to the same reagents and resources that CDC does, so it\u2019s test kits and each of those countries that are receiving it will go through the same procedures that the recipients in the U.S. are, which is they would do an internal validation verification process before they\u2019d be using those kits, so I also don\u2019t know yet, and we can follow up on this whether any country that has received the kits has gone through that process yet, and whether countries have actually used it. I just don\u2019t have that in front of me. Next question. Operator: Thank you, the next question is from Hillary Bourke with \u201cBusiness Insider,\u201d you may go ahead. Hillary Bourke: Yeah, thanks for taking my call. I had a question about the incubation period. I\u2019m wondering what you think about the new paper that suggests it\u2019s possible the virus might incubate for as long as 24 days in some cases. Have you seen any evidence to support that idea so far? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Yeah, so, it\u2019s a really interesting report that has come out. As you can imagine, there is a lot of data coming out and a lot of scientists appropriately are rushing to make sure that any data that they have is in the public realm where all the rest of the scientific community can make use of it. I applaud everyone\u2019s efforts. We have seen in some situations the rush to get data published hasn\u2019t necessarily led to there being the usual level of oversight to make sure that each of the findings is quality controlled, frankly. So, we\u2019re looking at that data closely, but we\u2019re frankly looking at all the other data that\u2019s available that looks at incubation periods. I would say the incubation period is obviously really important for us as we look to make sure that we\u2019re releasing these people safely from quarantine, but the abundance of data, that is available still is consistent with our current stance, which is to use 14 days as the end of that incubation period. I also would say that this is a confusing situation because there may be patients that have mild or even asymptomatic disease that isn\u2019t recognized and when you look at incubation period, you\u2019re starting at the point where a patient is exposed and then counting the days until that patient mounts symptoms. But if there is widespread community spread, for example, it may be that some of those initial exposures aren\u2019t detected and it makes it hard to be sure about the actual incubation period. Our CDC staff there actually are something like 50 separate modeling groups in the United States that are working with us on exactly these issues. It\u2019s important that we work with all of these modelers because they have different symptoms than we do, but we\u2019re working with all of the greatest minds in the country and globally try to pin down these facts as much as we can, and we still think that for today, for now, 14 days is the right interval to use. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mike Stobbe with the \u201cAssociated Press,\u201d you may go ahead. Mike stobbe: Hi, thank you for taking my call. My initial question is I need to ask about this, the reports out of China, the cases reported dropped down significantly the last couple of days. I know it\u2019s just two days, but they were in the 3,000 range and now they\u2019re 2,478 and 2,050, that dropped, what if anything do you make of that, and my follow-up question is about you discussed the kits going out to the states, could you say a little more about did kits go to all 50 states and were you expecting that they\u2019d be up and running this week but now it means it\u2019s going to be two weeks from now. Could you help us better understand the impact of what\u2019s going on and what kind of delay it entails, thank you. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Sure. It\u2019s only two questions this time. Good. So, the Chinese cases dropping down, I\u2019m going to be optimistic that that is a sign that their aggressive efforts have been effective, but I really do think it\u2019s too soon to say that for sure, not having hands on the data ourselves. There is a WHO advanced team in China now, and I\u2019m hopeful that they will have access to the data themselves and be able to validate those findings. It would certainly be reassuring if we were now seeing at least a slowdown of this outbreak in China. So that\u2019s the first question. The second question is a little complicated but what I would say is that of course we hoped that everything would go smoothly as we rushed through this, you know. We moved quickly, that\u2019s appropriate under these circumstances but it\u2019s equally appropriate to do quality control which is what we do, and where these \u2014 where this issue was caught, it is part of the normal procedures. Of course, I hoped that this week every state \u2014 and every state did receive a kit \u2014 every state would be up and running. How long is it going to take? I can\u2019t tell you that for sure because I understand that not every state has completed their verification yet. And it won\u2019t be until we have results from every state that we know which states can continue and which states we need to \u2014 we need to get new reagents to. We\u2019re working closely with FDA. Again, we do expect this week that some states may move forward. Other states may need to get additional reagents from CDC, and I don\u2019t have an estimate yet from our laboratory staff as to how long that takes, and when we do, we will definitely be, first, letting the states know and then letting you all know. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Denise Grady with \u201cNew York times.\u201d You may go ahead. Denise Grady: Hi, thank you very much. I\u2019ll ask you both questions. One is could you please go over the criteria, so we understand exactly who is being tested, who\u2019s qualified for testing and then if the result is negative, does it mean anything? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to just pause because there\u2019s an ambulance going through. Just wait. Okay. So, let\u2019s see, the criteria for testing in the United States focuses on people who are ill with the spectrum of symptoms that we have associated with this, which is fever, respiratory symptoms, cough, shortness of breath who have had appropriate travel history or who have been identified as contacts of a confirmed patient. And so, in each of the states where these cases have been identified, we\u2019ve been looking at potential contacts of patients as to look to see if it spread, that contact tracing did identify the two cases that we say weren\u2019t directly associated with travel. Those are in close contacts of two patients who traveled but outside of those close contacts around confirmed cases, our focus right now is on people who have a travel history that is consistent with where this outbreak is spreading. And we\u2019re comfortable with that as the basic criteria because so far, we are not seeing widespread community spread in the United States. That is that the cases we\u2019re seeing are all directly linked with travel to Hubei and China. It is also true that we did some testing of asymptomatic people, but it wasn\u2019t in the setting of trying to make a clinical diagnosis. It was in the setting of using that to try to learn more about how this is being spread, and I think people may have misunderstood it. We did that in the first 195 people who were repatriated into the United States, but we have not been testing asymptomatic people who have returned on the other repatriation flights. And that relates to this question of what being negative means. If we have a patient who is symptomatic and has the right travel history, a negative means that at least at that point we don\u2019t think they have disease. If a patient is at very high risk in clinical discussions with their health care provider and health department, they may be tested again. If they\u2019re at very high risk. But in general, in a symptomatic patient, a negative, we think means that they\u2019re negative. The difference is that when we were using it at march air force base to learn more about how this was being spread, it is possible that someone could be negative and still be incubating the virus and therefore we, in that setting, didn\u2019t judge a negative to let us be confident that somebody was able to be released from quarantine. So that\u2019s the distinction that we\u2019re making. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Julie Steenhuysen with \u201cReuters,\u201d you may go ahead. Julie Steenhuysen: Thanks, I have a couple of questions. First off, we know now that the w.h.o. Has a team in China. Are you \u2014 are any representatives from the CDC a part of that team? And can you say a little bit more about what kinds of problems the state labs encountered in validating the tests and why you need to send new reagents and finally are there any more flights expected from China carrying U.S. citizens? Thanks. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Okay. The advance team is three WHO staff. They\u2019re staff that are well known to us. They have a lot of experience. They are being articulated as an advance team, and I heard a report from them this morning. They\u2019re getting access to data, and doing the things you would expect them to do and as you all know, CDC stands ready to send staff to the affected areas in China to work on this investigation and as soon as we\u2019re given the invitation, we are happy to do that, but we haven\u2019t been invited yet. More planes, I think there is continued conversation that Americans who are still in Wuhan or other parts of China, so those conversations are ongoing, and I don\u2019t have any specific information right now as to whether there will be additional folks repatriated in groups like we saw with these planes. So, I don\u2019t have any specific information on that. In terms of the test problems, it gets a little weedy, but I can give you a little more detail. When a state gets the test kits, they have to verify that it works the same in their lab that it worked at CDC. And when some states were doing this, we received feedback that they weren\u2019t \u2014 that it wasn\u2019t working as expected, specifically some public health labs at states were getting inconclusive results and what that means is that test results were not coming back as false positive or false negatives, but they were being read as inconclusive. Now, these were not tests being run on actual clinical specimens from potential patients. These were part of the verification process, and because of that we are \u2014 when we evaluated what the issue is, we think that there might be an issue with one of the three assays and we think that maybe one of the reagents wasn\u2019t performing consistently, so it\u2019s a long story to say that we think that the issue at the states can be explained by one reagent that isn\u2019t performing as it should consistently and that\u2019s why we are re-manufacturing that reagent, obviously a state wouldn\u2019t want to be doing this test and using it to make clinical decisions if it isn\u2019t working as well as perfectly at the state as it is at CDC, so this is part of a normal process and procedure and redoing the manufacturing is the next step. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Erika Edwards with NBC news. You may go ahead. Erika Edwards: Yeah, just to follow up on that, are all the tests still coming through the CDC in Atlanta for conclusive results while the states work out their issues? And separately, I just wanted to learn more about your thoughts on that growing number of cases on the cruise ship docked in japan. I mean, is there anything that CDC is even able to do to help the Americans on board? Thanks. Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Yeah, thanks for the clarification and yes, all clinical specimens are still being sent to CDC for validation. I think you would expect nothing less from us as obviously the results of this test are so meaningful, and we\u2019ll continue to provide that backstopping frankly even after states are up and running. I would ask that you \u2014 that the right language wouldn\u2019t be a problem with the states. It\u2019s a collective problem, so I don\u2019t want this to be seen as something that the states are doing incorrectly. That is certainly not the situation here. This is really part of a normal process and procedure, and, you know, we have the quality control set up specifically to allow us to identify these kinds of problems. In terms of the cruise ship, I know that there are Americans on board, there are certainly Americans that are ill and it\u2019s certainly concerning the high number of cases on that cruise ship. We are working closely with the embassy in japan, and the state department to help with thinking through what\u2019s the right actions. Somebody from the state department may be on the phone, and if so, I\u2019ll ask them if they want to make a comment on this. Ben, is somebody there? Benjamin Haynes: No, Nancy, sorry, nobody from \u2014 Dr. Nancy Messonnier: Okay. So, I guess they\u2019re probably not on the phone because they\u2019re helping \u2014 working with us to think through what to do. Obviously, it\u2019s a high priority to make sure that the people that are already sick or the people that are still on the ship and asymptomatic are getting the best care possible. We want to protect their health, and we\u2019re working closely, again, through the embassy on thinking through what the right next steps are, and when there\u2019s more information, we will clearly make that available as quickly as possible. Next question. Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tom Howell with the \u201cWashington Times.\u201d You may go ahead. Tom Howell: Hi, thanks for doing the call. Just branching off the question about the cruise ship, do you have any numbers of how many Americans are on board and how many of them might be infected if any? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I actually don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me but what I would say is there are definitely Americans on board who have been diagnosed with and now I have to get this name right, nCoV 19. Excuse me for not getting it right. I\u2019m still working on it. There are Americans on board that have been diagnosed with nCoV 19, but I don\u2019t have the numbers on me right now, and we can certainly follow up. Next question. Operator: Thank you, the next question comes from Nate Wetzel with \u201cThe Hill,\u201d you may go ahead. Nate Wetzel: Hi, thanks for doing this call. I\u2019m just wondering, there have been reports that the virus might either weaken or sort of die out as the weather gets warmer. Do you have any evidence for that? Has that been officially confirmed? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: So, I think I would caution overinterpreting that hypothesis. I think what folks are saying, which I think is a valid point is that most viral respiratory diseases are seasonal, and we\u2019ll use as an example influenza. Influenza has a season. It can alter a little bit but it\u2019s generally, we know what time of year is going to be the peak of influenza and in general, as we head towards spring and summer, we expect the cases of influenza in the United States to fall off. That\u2019s true for other viral respiratory diseases also that have a winter season. So, if this behaves similarly, it may be that as we head towards summer and, I guess, spring and summer, the cases would go down, but this is a new disease. We haven\u2019t even been through six weeks of it, much less a year, and so I certainly would, I mean, I\u2019m happy to hope that it goes down as the weather warms up, but I think it\u2019s premature to assume that, and we\u2019re certainly not using that to sit back and expect it to go away. The aggressive actions were taken or we\u2019re taking are because we don\u2019t think we can count on that since again, we haven\u2019t been through even a single year with this pathogen. Next question. Benjamin Haynes: Sue, we have time for one more question, please. Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Steve Baragona with \u201cvoice of America,\u201d you may go ahead. Steve Baragona: Hi, thanks for doing the call. You mentioned a couple of times about information you\u2019re getting from the Chinese. I know that\u2019s been an issue throughout this outbreak. How is your access to data? Are you getting all the information you need, and if not, what\u2019s the hold up? What impact does that have on your ability to respond? Dr. Nancy Messonnier: I\u2019m happy to talk about this. I\u2019ll start by saying there\u2019s nothing really new in this space compared to what we have said previously. There has been a lot more data coming out of China in the recent weeks, compared to perhaps from the very beginning, and there have been meetings, for example, hosted by w.h.o. Where Chinese authorities have presented their data. As an epidemiologist seeing a graph that somebody else produced is never as good as touching the data yourself. Being able to look at it yourself and being able to ask the questions and run the data directly, so having that distance from the actual ongoing investigation in China or anywhere is never the best way for us to be able to be completely confident that we understand the situation. That is the \u2014 part of the reason that we want to have folks on the ground. I\u2019m working specifically on this investigation, the other is that I would say that CDC scientists are certainly some of the best in the world and our scientists have a lot to offer in terms of looking at what\u2019s going on right now in terms of the analysis. We also find that when you\u2019re in the midst of doing an investigation yourself, sometimes it\u2019s hard to step back and folks coming from outside who haven\u2019t been so enmeshed in the day-to-day sometimes can pick up things you didn\u2019t think of or have a different perspective. That\u2019s the other reason that it would be helpful to have a broader set of folks being able to look at the data itself. I have nothing new to say in terms of the data coming out. There is more coming out in the published literature but CDC staff themselves haven\u2019t yet gained direct access to the data and we continue to be hopeful that we\u2019ll be invited to do that. Thank you. Benjamin Haynes: Thank you, Dr. Messonnier, and thank you all for joining us for today\u2019s briefing.

                              "text": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: I have significant pollen allergies and asthma. In the spring, I usually have sneezing, coughing and an occasional sore throat that coincides with the trees blooming. With COVID-19 concerns, I am wondering if I am at any increased risk for the virus or need to be concerned that I should be tested? ANSWER: Certainly, in many parts of the U.S., spring is in full bloom. And with the arrival of spring comes an increase in seasonal allergies, often to the pollen that is produced by trees. Given the situation with COVID-19, many people have questions about increased risk of infection or complications from the virus. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that leads to symptoms such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing. Symptoms can range widely, from mild to severe. While the Centers for Disease Control states individuals with asthma may be at greater risk for infection with COVID-19, the Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology notes there is no data to substantiate that patients with allergies and asthma are at an increased risk COVID-19. Allergies, which affect millions of people, occur when a person's immune system reacts to a foreign substance, such as pollen, pet dander or certain foods. Asthma is a condition that causes airways to narrow and swell, and produce extra mucus. Though certain symptoms may overlap, allergies differ from COVID-19 with respect to the sudden onset of illness and symptoms. Typical seasonal allergy symptoms include itchy, watery eyes; itchy, runny nose; sneezing; nasal congestion; and postnasal drip. Though you might experience some of the same symptoms with a cold or other virus, COVID-19 symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and potentially some gastrointestinal upset. Though asthma can make breathing difficult, and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, if you are asthmatic, you would likely recognize an attack. But it would be unlikely that you would have a fever. COVID-19 symptoms tend to come on quickly and worsen. With allergy and asthma, a change of scenery and medication can easily help improve symptoms. If you have allergies or asthma, it is important to know your triggers and make accommodations, especially given the current stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines surrounding COVID-19. For example, if you are allergic to oak tree pollen, but have taken to running outdoors as opposed to in a gym, you may want to reduce your mileage and plan to shower immediately after you complete your exercise. If you know dust is a trigger for your asthma, be mindful to adjust your chore schedule to vacuum or mop more often. Also, continue to use your steroid inhalers and nasal sprays. Although there has been concern about these medications and their link to increasing the spread of COVID-19, there is no literature to substantiate this. The same is true for saline irrigation. The recommendations are to continue using your asthma and allergy medication, whether over-the-counter or prescription. For effectiveness, however, make sure you're using your nasal sprays properly. Avoid spraying your septum or nasal bone, which can thin the skin and cause bleeding. Rather, tilt the head down, shake the bottle and then aim toward the ear. Spray and sniff in slowly. Then shake the bottle and repeat in the other nostril. Also remember to wipe the nozzle down after each use and not share bottles with anyone else. If you find your current over-the-counter allergy medication is not working as effectively as you'd like, consider switching brands for a short time. Oftentimes, your body can build up a tolerance and the medication may become less effective at controlling your symptoms. Switching to another brand for a few weeks may help. If your symptoms worsen and you have concerns that you may have contracted COVID-19, you should contact your health care provider. Stay informed on COVID-19 and get your information from reliable sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Mayo Clinic.\u2014 Dr. Arveen Bhasin, Allergy and Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida For the latest updates on the COVID-19 pandemic, check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

                              "text": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: I have read that COVID-19 spreads from person to person, but can it also live on objects? Should I be concerned about catching the virus from things I buy at the grocery store or while filling up my car with gas? ANSWER: Your highest risk of catching COVID-19 is being exposed to a person ill with COVID-19. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that leads to symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. The virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when someone infected coughs or sneezes. If you breathe in the droplets, or they land on your eyes, nose or mouth, you are at risk of infection. You're also at risk if you touch a surface where the droplets have landed, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. At this time, expert estimates are that the virus may live on a surface anywhere from a few hours to up to nine days, depending on the type of surface, as well as the surrounding temperature and environment. When possible, disinfect surfaces in your house, in public spaces that you touch, and wash your hands thoroughly after being out in public. There are steps that you can take to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 from surfaces. In your home, clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces routinely, including doorknobs, light switches, faucets, countertops, tables, toilets and sinks. Household cleaners and disinfectants that you can buy in your local stores work well. Wash your hands when you're done. When you're out in public, many stores provide disinfectant wipes to use on carts and baskets. Wipe the handles of those items before you use them. You may want to consider carrying a small supply of disinfecting wipes with you to use if they are not provided in a store, or to use on surfaces, such as gasoline pumps, where wipes are less likely to be nearby. Use an alcohol-based wipe rather than baby wipes, which may not be effective at getting rid of the virus. While items you buy at the grocery store could harbor COVID-19 if someone who's infected coughs or sneezes on them, the overall risk is low. And it isn't practical to disinfect each item you purchase, although you should continue to wash all produce thoroughly before you eat it. Instead, wash your hands after you return home from the grocery store or any other public space. As an extra precaution, wash them again after you've put all your grocery items away. Both washing your hands with soap and water and using hand sanitizer are good options. To effectively wash your hands, first get them wet with clean, running water. Apply soap and lather well. Rub your hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Remember to scrub all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, your thumbs, wrists, between your fingers and under your fingernails. Rinse well and dry your hands with a clean towel, or let them air-dry. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol. Use enough hand sanitizer that it takes about 15 seconds for it to dry with rubbing. To further reduce your risk of catching the virus, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, particularly when you're out in public or if your hands are not clean. As you think about ways to stay healthy, keep in mind that guidance regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is ever-changing.

Dr. Clayton Cowl, chair of Mayo Clinic's Division of Preventive, Occupational and Aerospace Medicine, says symptoms can come on rapidly. These symptoms can be especially dangerous for people over 70; immunosuppressed people; and those with underlying conditions, such as lung disease, heart disease and diabetes. Dr. Cowl says that many people who contract the disease will have mild or no symptoms. But if they develop symptoms, when and how should they seek medical help? Should they get tested? Dr. Cowl says the first things that you should do are remain at home, drink plenty of fluids and take a fever-reducing medication. If symptoms intensify, call your health care provider, local hospital or clinic. \"It really is important to emphasize that, unless is it a medical emergency, you should not go in to the hospital or visit your health care provider without at least calling first,\" says Dr. Cowl. \"By calling first, you can avoid exposing yourself and others to the virus. And you can help prevent an overflow situation at the medical facility.\" Watch Dr. Cowl discuss what to do if you suspect COVID-19. Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites with Dr. Cowl are in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy \"Clayton Cowl, M.D., Preventive, Occupational and Aerospace Medicine, Mayo Clinic.\" Symptoms of COVID-19 Shortness of breath Cough Fever Fatigue Muscle aches \"Symptoms of COVID-19 are typically myalgia, or muscle aches, and a lot of fatigue. Usually it's associated with a fever. Sometimes it's low-grade from 100.3 F to perhaps higher. Some people experience much higher fever that go up to 102 F or 103F. Individuals may experience some shortness of breath. They may experience cough. And it can either be a dry cough, or they may cough up phlegm.\" When to seek help The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that if you think you have been exposed to COVID-19, and you develop symptoms such as a cough, fever and shortness of breath, you should call your health care provider. If you are concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19 but do not have symptoms, Dr. Cowl says you do not need to be tested. You should self-monitor for symptoms that may develop and use good hand hygiene. He adds that since the COVID-19 situation is evolving, experts are learning more about the virus every day. Recommendations for testing also may change. \"Right now, the recommendation is if you're asymptomatic, you do not need to be tested,\" says Dr. Cowl. \"Part of that is because the number of testing kits needed are not available. But, clinically, if you're asymptomatic, no test.\" Dr. Cowl emphasizes that if you think you may have COVID-19, call your healthcare provider first, rather than showing up without warning. But if you experience more severe symptoms, seek emergency medical care.

Therefore, those with RA who develop COVID-19 may be at higher risk for developing severe symptoms and additional complications. FDA NOTICE The FDA have removed the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on a review of the latest research, the FDA determined that these drugs are not likely to be an effective treatment for COVID-19 and that the risks of using them for this purpose might outweigh any benefits. Treatment options for RA may also affect the immune system, increasing the risk further. However, in most cases, doctors do not recommend abruptly stopping any treatments for RA, as this may lead to a flare. The best way to reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 is by staying home (shelter-in-place), and maintaining consistent infection prevention habits to inhibit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease. Keep reading to learn more about how COVID-19 may affect a person with RA, including what current research says, the risks, and the precautions people should take. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. How does COVID-19 affect people with RA? Share on Pinterest As a person with RA has an impaired immune system, they may be at higher risk of developing COVID-19. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the lining of the joints. Autoimmune conditions, such as RA, compromise the immune system, in varying degrees of severity. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other expert bodies are still investigating the impact of the novel coronavirus on people with preexisting conditions. Some research published in Autoimmunity Reviews suggests that people with RA have an increased risk of contracting the virus due to their impaired immune system. Factors that can affect the vulnerability of someone with RA include medication, age, and other health conditions. Treatments for RA, including corticosteroids and drugs that modify or suppress the immune system, may increase the risk of infection. The British Society for Rheumatology created a risk scoring guide chart to clarify the potential level of risk that someone with RA may be at. Is COVID-19 dangerous for people with RA? According to the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance Global Registry, which supplies live-time information regarding rheumatic diseases and COVID-19, people with RA may be at higher risk for infection and developing severe symptoms. This may be truer for people with very high disease activity, people who have trouble controlling their symptoms, or those with other health conditions. A person with RA who also has other risk factors, such as being over 65, living in a long-term care facility, or having another medical condition, may be at a higher risk for severe illness. Additionally, people with RA who take certain drugs, such as immunosuppressant drugs, to control symptoms may be more at risk for infections or complications from those infections. However, people should not stop, change the dosage of, or take a new medication or supplement without contacting their doctor. Currently, there is not much formal evidence connecting COVID-19 and RA. Symptoms to look out for The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that the most common symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, a dry cough, and shortness of breath. These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after infection. A report from the WHO also notes that other symptoms may include: fatigue extra mucus production a sore throat severe headache chills nausea or vomiting nasal congestion diarrhea The CDC also include the loss of taste and smell as a symptom of COVID-19 In some cases, a COVID-19 infection can cause aches and pains in the joints. This pain may mimic the pain of RA or make RA seem worse. Additionally, people who are at risk should pay especially close attention to the emergency warning signs of a COVID-19 infection. According to the CDC, emergency warning signs include: difficulty breathing constant pressure or pain in the chest New sensations of confusion or an inability to arouse A bluish hue in the skin of the face or lips Anyone experiencing the emergency signs of COVID-19 infection should seek medical attention immediately. Extra care and precautions required People with RA should take extra care to prevent their exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In general, the CDC recommend that people who are at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and avoid close contact with others. Several general practices can also help to reduce the spread of the virus. General prevention tips include: staying home whenever possible washing the hands regularly with warm water and soap, lathering for at least 20 seconds coating the hands in an alcohol-based sanitizer when soap is not available regularly disinfecting frequently used surfaces, such as countertops, keyboards, and phones practicing physical distancing if a person needs to go out, staying at least 6 feet away from others while in public, and wearing a mask avoiding contact with people who are sick in any way keeping supplies of food and medication to hand so the person has access to them if they need to quarantine avoiding public areas, such as public restrooms and public transportation avoiding all non-essential travel Additionally, the CDC now recommend that people wear cloth masks while in public as an additional step to slow the spread of the virus. Medications People with RA should take steps to ensure they have access to their medicines. Anyone who relies on drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, to treat RA should talk to their doctor or pharmacist about ensuring their access to treatment. People with RA should not slow or stop any treatments they are taking without their doctor\u2019s permission. This includes medication s that may suppress the immune system, such as biologics or DMARDs. Stopping taking a medication may cause a flare-up, which can put more stress on the body. However, sometimes a doctor may recommend that a person takes reduced doses of immunosuppressant medication and lengthens the intervals between infusions. Some people have voiced concerns over the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control symptoms. However, the Arthritis Foundation note that there is no clear evidence that using NSAIDs will increase a person\u2019s risk of developing COVID-19 or that they will experience more significant adverse effects from the disease should they contract it. People who rely on any of these medications to manage RA should talk to their doctor to asses their specific risks. Treatment and symptom management There is currently no direct treatment for COVID-19. Treatment will largely vary on the severity of the illness and the symptoms a person has. People who only experience mild to moderate symptoms may be able to manage the illness in their homes. However, people must work closely with their doctors to monitor symptoms and potential treatments. People with severe symptoms may require hospitalization to treat symptoms and complications. Treatments will vary in each case based on the complications. Some people with severe complications may require oxygen supplementation to help them get enough oxygen into their lungs. Others may require mechanical respiration if their lungs begin to fail. What to do if test positive Anyone who tests positive for SARS-Cov2 should work closely with their doctor to discuss and implement any treatments necessary to manage symptoms. A public health professional may also assist in tracing others they have been in contact with. This is known as contact-tracing. A person who tests positive for the novel coronavirus should self-isolate. This means staying at home. Ideally, a person with COVID-19 should self-isolate in a room away from other family members, using a separate bathroom if possible. A person can leave the house to collect medicines if no one else can do it for them. Wear a mask, especially when leaving home. Prognosis A large report from the WHO notes that approximately 80% of confirmed COVID-19 cases experience mild to moderate symptoms. These infections may clear up at home, using over-the-counter or prescription drugs to manage symptoms. People who experience moderate to severe infections may require hospitalization. Treatments may include oxygen supplementation to keep enough oxygen in the lungs. In critically severe cases, the person may need mechanical ventilation to keep oxygen in the lungs. In the most severe cases, a person may experience organ failure and shock that could be life-threatening.",

The apparent longevity boost was seen with instant, ground and decaffeinated, results that echo U.S. research. It\u2019s the first large study to suggest a benefit even in people with genetic glitches affecting how their bodies use caffeine. Overall, coffee drinkers were about 10 percent to 15 percent less likely to die than abstainers during a decade of follow-up. Differences by amount of coffee consumed and genetic variations were minimal. The results don\u2019t prove your coffee pot is a fountain of youth nor are they a reason for abstainers to start drinking coffee, said Alice Lichtenstein, a Tufts University nutrition expert who was not involved in the research.

Or at least not be bad,\u201d Lichtenstein said. The study was published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. It\u2019s not clear exactly how drinking coffee might affect longevity. Lead author Erikka Loftfield, a researcher at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, said coffee contains more than 1,000 chemical compounds including antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage. Other studies have suggested that substances in coffee may reduce inflammation and improve how the body uses insulin, which can reduce chances for developing diabetes. Loftfield said efforts to explain the potential longevity benefit are continuing. Adam Taylor, fetching two iced coffees for friends Monday in downtown Chicago, said the study results make sense. \u201cCoffee makes you happy, it gives you something to look forward to in the morning,\u201d said Taylor, a sound engineer from Las Vegas. \u201cI try to have just one cup daily,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cOtherwise I get a little hyper.\u201d For the study, researchers invited 9 million British adults to take part; 498,134 women and men aged 40 to 69 agreed. The low participation rate means those involved may have been healthier than the general U.K. population, the researchers said. Participants filled out questionnaires about daily coffee consumption, exercise and other habits, and received physical exams including blood tests. Most were coffee drinkers; 154,000 or almost one-third drank two to three cups daily and 10,000 drank at least eight cups daily. During the next decade, 14,225 participants died, mostly of cancer or heart disease. Caffeine can cause short-term increases in blood pressure, and some smaller studies have suggested that it might be linked with high blood pressure, especially in people with a genetic variation that causes them to metabolize caffeine slowly. But coffee drinkers in the U.K. study didn\u2019t have higher risks than nondrinkers of dying from heart disease and other blood pressure-related causes. And when all causes of death were combined, even slow caffeine metabolizers had a longevity boost. As in previous studies, coffee drinkers were more likely than abstainers to drink alcohol and smoke, but the researchers took those factors into account, and coffee drinking seemed to cancel them out. The research didn\u2019t include whether participants drank coffee black or with cream and sugar. But Lichtenstein said loading coffee with extra fat and calories isn\u2019t healthy. ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter: @LindseyTanner . ____ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

                              "text": "California cities pioneered soda taxes as a way to combat obesity, diabetes and heart disease, but the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday bowed to pressure from beverage companies and reluctantly banned local taxes on soda for the next 12 years. It follows similar bans recently passed in Arizona and Michigan. Voters in Oregon will decide on a statewide ban in November. The American Beverage Association, which represents Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and others, has backed the moves after several cities passed taxes on sugary drinks in recent years. California\u2019s ban is part of a last-minute maneuver to block a beverage industry-backed ballot measure that would make it much harder for cities and counties to raise taxes of any kind. The ABA said in a statement the legislation is about keeping groceries, including drinks, affordable. Lawmakers approved the proposal despite deep reluctance. \u201cThis industry is aiming a nuclear weapon at government in California and saying, \u2018If you don\u2019t do what we want we are going to pull the trigger and you are not going to be able to fund basic government services,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, which has a soda tax. The Legislature\u2019s action drew a strong rebuke from public health advocates who view soda taxes as a crucial front in their efforts to contain obesity and the health complications it causes. But local government officials, terrified by the prospect of having their hands tied on all future tax increases, reluctantly backed the legislation. \u201cI\u2019ve been in politics a long time, and sometimes you have to do what\u2019s necessary to avoid catastrophe,\u201d said Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, who is pushing a local sales tax increase that would be at risk if the ballot measure passed. The governor said only a handful of communities are looking to tax soda, but the ballot measure would affect all 482 cities in California. \u201cMayors from countless cities have called to voice their alarm and to strongly support the compromise which this bill represents,\u201d Brown wrote in a memo explaining his decision. The California measure bans any new taxes on groceries including beverages through 2030, but allows four cities in the San Francisco Bay Area to keep soda levies already on the books. The beverage industry has used aggressive campaigning to beat back soda taxes and other measures. But some soda tax efforts are now receiving better funding. Former New York City Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who unsuccessfully tried to limit the size of sugary drinks sold in the city to 16 ounces, has funded some local efforts. Philadelphia, Seattle and Boulder, Colorado also have taxes on sugary drinks. After Brown signed the legislation, the California Business Roundtable withdrew a ballot measure that would have raised the threshold for any tax increases by local government. Nancy Brown, chief executive of the American Heart Association, asked for a meeting with Gov. Jerry Brown after The Sacramento Bee reported beverage industry lobbyists dined with Brown and his wife Anne Gust Brown at the governor\u2019s mansion in Sacramento this month. A spokesman for Brown, Evan Westrup, said the governor did not negotiate the deal and the dinner was unrelated. Public health officials said taxes are the most effective tool they have to discourage people from drinking soda, sports drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, and other sugary beverages. Beverage companies spend billions promoting their products that public health professional can\u2019t match, said Kristine Madsen, a physician and associate professor of public health at University of California, Berkeley. She led a study that found a 20 percent reduction in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in low-income neighborhoods in the year after the city\u2019s tax took effect. Sales in grocery stores dropped 8 percent \u2014 a figure that was not fully offset by higher sales in neighboring towns. ___ The bill is AB1838 . ___ Associated Press food industry writer Candice Choi contributed.",

The outrageous-sounding story\u00a0was picked up by multiple media outlets. However, the Solano County District Attorney\u2019s office said the case is being mischaracterized. Ken Kramer, chief investigator for the D.A.\u2019s office, told us prosecutors initially believed Joseph Schwab, 36, was under the influence of a substance that did not readily turn up on laboratory toxicology tests, and that Schwab has not been charged with driving\u00a0under the influence of caffeine: The District Attorney\u2019s Office is continuing to investigate the case by consulting with experts to determine what substance contributed to the defendant\u2019s impaired driving. As of 28 December 2016, the D.A.\u2019s office dropped the DUI charge \u2014 but Schwab is still being charged with reckless driving: At the time the case was filed, the DUI Unit filed the DUI charge based upon the observations and opinion of the officer that the defendant was under the influence of a combination of substances, including a stimulant and a depressant. The officer\u2019s observations included the defendant\u2019s erratic and reckless driving, his demeanor at the time of the traffic stop, and his performance on a number of field sobriety tests. According to the D.A.\u2019s office, Schwab was driving on an interstate highway in Solano County (which is in California\u2019s Bay Area) when he cut in front of\u00a0an on-duty officer with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms: The officer then observed the same driver erratically weaving in and out of traffic almost causing several collisions. The officer initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle. During the traffic stop, the driver, Joseph Schwab, was contacted and the officer observed the defendant to be highly agitated, \u201camped up,\u201d and his pupils were dilated. The officer noticed a number of work out supplements in the vehicle. The officer administered several standardized field sobriety tests, which are used routinely to determine impairment. Based upon the defendant\u2019s performance of the field sobriety tests, the officer believed the defendant was too impaired to operate a motor vehicle and he was arrested for misdemeanor violations of Vehicle Code Section 23152(e) and Vehicle Code Section 23103. The officer offered the defendant to submit to a drug recognition evaluation, but he declined. We were unable to reach Schwab\u2019s attorney, Stacey Barrett, but she told the Guardian that she believed charges should be dropped because she has not received evidence that Schwab was under the influence of any substance other than caffeine: I have not been provided with any evidence to support a theory of prosecution for a substance other than caffeine at this time. Nor I have received any statements, reports, etc documenting any ongoing investigation since the [toxicology report] dated 18 November 2015.",

                              "text": "Editor's note: World War II veteran Hershel \u201cWoody\u201d Williams, 94, flipped the coin at Super Bowl LII. Here's his story of his service, in his own words.  Hershel Williams, 91, received the Medal of Honor for valor during the World War II Battle of Iwo Jima.  The citation that was read when he received the nation's highest military honor from Pres. Harry Truman noted that his \"unyielding determination and extraordinary heroism in the face of ruthless enemy resistance were directly instrumental in neutralizing one of the most fanatically defended Japanese strong points encountered by his regiment and aided in enabling his company to reach its objective.\"  Williams has been an active participant in Congressional Medal of Honor Society events over the years, and his latest project has been an effort to build memorials honoring Gold Star Families in all 50 states.  In 2014, Williams sat down with Stars and Stripes to tell his story.  Joining the military  During the peacetime period, before World War II, the Marine Corps was really trying to make its way, I guess. The dress blues had come into play, and one of the best ways to get advertising was to see these guys in dress blues. Immediately, \"hey, that's the Marine Corps.\" It's different than any other uniform. I have to say that the Army uniform during that period of time, that old brown, was certainly not an attractive uniform. So the Marine Corps sort of stood out, wherever they were.  We had a couple of fellas in our community that, they didn't like to do farming or hard work, maybe, so they joined the Marine Corps ... really, to make a living. They were not related, didn't really know each other, perhaps. But anyway, when they came home, they'd always have to wear the dress blues. That was their orders, that they wore the dress blues all the time. In those days, you got one 30-day furlough a year. That was it. Once you used up your 30 days, you're done until the next year. So they would come home, and during that period of time we kids would get around them and they'd tell us all kinds of crazy stories. Probably most of them weren't true ...  But anyway, we were sort of enthralled with those guys, and in my mind, I said, you know, I ever ... and I had no desire to go in the military. I'm going to be a farmer the rest of my life. But if I ever do, that's what I want to look like. A couple of reasons for that: One, they were always tall and straight, very proud. Very polite, very polite to women, always \"yes, ma'am, yes sir\" and all that stuff. So they really created a great image in my mind. I said \"if I ever do this, or do anything, I want to be a Marine. I want to look like that guy.\"  So that's why I wanted to go in the Marine Corps. Had no idea what the war was. This was 1942.  In December of 1941, I was in the Civilian Conservation Corps, out in the state of Montana, when Pearl Harbor was bombed. And of course they called us out, there were about 265 of us \u2014 youth, boys, up to 25 years of age \u2014 in that camp. They were from all over the country \u2014 there were New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, West Virginia, Ohio \u2014 and they told us that America had been bombed at Pearl Harbor. Nobody in the group knew where Pearl Harbor was or what it was. Didn't mean a thing. Associated it with the United States, somehow. So they gave us a choice: You could go straight into the Army \u2014 because we wore Army uniforms, we were paid by the Army, treated medically by the Army, they ruled us, that sort \u2014 we could go straight into the Army, or you could request release and go home to enter into the military. So that's what I did, because I wanted to be a Marine. I didn't want to be in the Army. So they turned me loose.  I was so naive that I thought, if I go in the military, go in the Marine Corps, I'm going to stay right here in the United States. to protect America. Because that's what they said [enemies] were trying to do, take America and take our freedom away from us. And I'd never heard of the Japanese ... I didn't even know we had a South Pacific. So I'm going to stay right here in the United States. All of us will be here, and we just dare anybody to come try to take our country. Because they're not going to get in, you know?  Quite a shock when they told me I'm going to the South Pacific, to some islands I never knew existed.  Iwo Jima  Iwo Jima was a different kind of a combat. I'd been in a previous campaign, when we took Guam back, and Guam was still mostly jungle. Once we got off of the beach and over the first ridge line, we began encountering really thick jungle fighting. And that's the way it was until we got to the other shore. But Iwo ... none of us, of course, had ever heard of it; they didn't tell us that's where we were going until they got us aboard ship and they brought out this board with a diagram on it that showed what Iwo Jima would look like. Guam was 19 miles from one shore to the other. This one, 2\u00bd miles. It looked awful small, compared to what we had just been through.  And of course the officer during the briefing said we would probably never get off ship. We'd be gone about five days, as a reserve. Probably would never need us, never use us, but we were there, in case. So none of us were very anxious about this thing, 'cause we're just going for a boat ride.  But after the first day, and the loss of casualties on that first day, they decided they were going to need some more Marines, and we were ordered then to prepare to go in.  The second day, they didn't have enough room for us. They hadn't taken enough ground that we could get in behind them, so we went back aboard ship and spent another night. Then the next day they did have enough ground. By that time they were surrounding Mount Suribachi, and there was enough beach area to get us ashore. And then we became the spearhead for the island.  Our job was to go up the center and split it, drive them in each direction toward the other two divisions that were on there. And on the 23rd, I was a flamethrower operator, demolition individual. I was in charge of six Marines. I was a corporal. We had what we called a special unit, a special weapons unit. So we'd been trained to either blow something up or burn something up, and we could do either one. We could be an operator for the flamethrower, or we could be a demolition person.  But by the 23rd of February, five days in the campaign, those guys ... I'd lost them. They'd either been wounded or killed. I didn't have anybody left in the company. So we had lost a great number of our squad leaders, all but three of our officers. We were just ... it was devastating. So our commanding officer called a meeting. Wanted all the NCOs there. And as a corporal I was not classified as an NCO. But I was told because ... they didn't say because, but I was told I should go to the meeting simply because there were so few of the NCOs left.  So I joined the group and we huddled in a great big shell crater. Probably a bomb crater. But it was big enough that all of us could get below ground so that we couldn't be shot at with grazing fire. That's where we met, and of course the commanding officer was looking for ideas or ways in which we might be able to break through a series of reinforced concrete pillboxes that we'd encountered, and they were self-protecting. If you were to visit Iwo Jima today. you would find that they're built in pods of three, and you can't get to one without one of the other of them being able to see you. And that's the way the general wanted it to be. But he asked me if I could do anything with a flamethrower, knock our some of those pillboxes, because they were reinforced with what we call rebar today. In those days we just called it iron rods. But they were reinforced with that, and bazookas and artillery, even mortars dropping on the top of it ... that didn't do anything. So the only way to eliminate it was, burn it out with a flamethrower or blow it up with demolition.  I've said many times, I don't know my response to him when he asked me that question, \"Could I do anything with a flamethrower?\" Some of the men who survived said that I said I'll try ... so, I went to work.  He gave me four Marines. Their job was to ... as I would pick out the pillbox that I'm going to work on, their job was to shoot at that aperture in front of it, because that was their field of fire. That was their only field of fire, but it covered the whole area. That aperture was about eight inches [high], and across the front of the pillbox. So they could stick their rifles out, or machine guns, and have a whole field of fire out there. But [the Marines'] job was to fire at that, try to keep the Japanese from being able to fire at me. I would pick the pillbox and start toward it, and that was their job. Two of those Marines got killed that day, because the Japanese were shooting at them. One of them was an automatic weapons man, and the other was a rifleman. Automatic weapons, [the Japanese] didn't like those any more than they liked flamethrowers, so we lost a couple of those guys. So actually they gave their life protecting mine. There's no way I could ever repay that.  You go in automatic drive when something like that happens, I think. Much of that four hours, I don't remember. I attribute that to fear. Because to say I wasn't scared would be the biggest lie that's ever been told. Because you do experience fear.  Flamethrowers  We used, instead of a napalm \u2014 I guess that came from Vietnam \u2014 we had back at that time a gel. We called it a phosphorus gel because it had phosphorus in it, and it was like a single stream of water. But if it landed on you, it stuck. It was sticky. And if you tried to brush it off, it had phosphorus in it, so all you'd do is spread the phosphorus. You'd just make it worse by trying to brush it off.  But while we were still on Guadalcanal and still training, the gunnery sergeant that was our instructor ... we'd never seen a flamethrower before, so we had a manual, and that was our method of learning how to operate this thing and what to do with it. Our first fluid, or stuff to fire out of it, was this gel. And you only have 72 seconds of it. So by the time \u2014 you can't aim the weapon because you're holding it down here \u2014 by the time you got to target, you're out of stuff. And if you don't hit the target, then you've wasted all the stuff. [The gunnery sergeant] hated it. He didn't like that stuff at all. He was just absolutely dead set, there's got to be a better way of doing this.  So we began experimenting while we were on Guam. We used kerosene, and we used motor oil, and we used regular gasoline, and mixed it together and tried to come up with some kind of a something that 1500 pounds per square inch of pressure would shoot out and shoot it a distance anyway. And finally we came up ... one day he drove in \u2014 he had a jeep \u2014 and he drove in with a 55-gallon drum in the back of that jeep. Never did did know \u2014 of course, nobody ever asked the gunnery sergeant where \u2014 we never did know where he got it, but it was 130 octane airplane gasoline.  So we began working with that, of course, under his instruction, and we finally arrived at a measurement of so much diesel fuel and so much gasoline. Diesel fuel would give it a little weight, so it would go ... if you just fired straight gasoline out of that thing, it wouldn't go 10 feet. It hits the air and just spreads out and quits. So we mixed diesel fuel with it, kept experimenting. and finally you could get about 30 yards out of it. But if you fired it into the air, it stopped. Because the air resistance killed it. If you fired it on the ground, you could roll it. Just a great big ball of fire would roll, and you could get 30 yards out of it. Roll it into the pillbox, rather than try to shoot it into the pillbox.  So that's how we trained. We set those flamethrowers out in the field, and shot at them with M-1 rifles and .30 caliber machine guns to try to blow those things up, because that thing's on your back, and [if] that thing blows up, you're going sky-high. So we tried to blast those things open; we couldn't. We could cut the hose ... you know, you could shoot the hose, because it was rubber with a wire inside that kept it stiff. You could penetrate that, then your fluid wouldn't even get to your gun. But blow 'em up ... couldn't do it. We tried every way. So they were safe as far as explosive on your back was concerned.  But they weighed 70 pounds, and the first ones that they came out with didn't have what they called a back brace on it, [so] when you sat down with 70 pounds on your back you just automatically fell over backwards. And you'd lay on your back until they got ready to ... you know, you got a 10-minute break out of every hour. And you'd just lay on your back until they'd say \"OK, saddle up, we're going,\" then you'd roll over on your belly, then you'd get up. Because you just couldn't get up with 70 pounds on your ... you just couldn't lean forward and get up. Well, eventually somebody got smart and put a rod at the bottom so when you sat down that rod would set on the ground, and that took all te weight off your shoulders, so you could sit there comfortably and rest. Then you could roll over and get up.  Under fire  But one great experience \u2014 I guess you could call it a great experience, certainly one of the more scary experiences \u2014 I was crawling up this ditch, trying to get to a pillbox that was shooting at me with a Nambu machine gun. And their Nambu was like our .30 caliber, but it had a very distinct noise. You could distinguish a Nambu ... any time it fired, you knew that was a Nambu. It was a .31 caliber, ours was a .30 caliber. Ours fired about 750, theirs fired 1000 rounds a minute. They were firing at me with that thing.  And I'm crawling up this ditch, and all of a sudden the guy with the Nambu lowered it to te point where he was ricocheting bullets off of my air tank on my back. It was just ... we didn't know jackhammers back in those days; they didn't have such a thing. But as I got older it kind of reminded me of a jackhammer because it was \"brrrrrrrrrr,\" you know? Real fast. I mean, a thousand rounds a minute is pretty fast. And it was ricocheting off my air tank, and fortunately, they went up instead of down.  Fortunately ... and I don't think I had anything to do with this in the way of conscious thought: Don't back up. Go forward. Because if I'd have backed up, I would've brought myself more into the field of fire, because he could've lowered his Nambu a little more. As I went forward, apparently he had it down as far as he could get it, and when I went forward, I got out of his field of fire. Do I have any explanation for that? Not in the world. The Master took care of that. So we don't ... there is no explanation.  Facetiously, I\u2019ve said those other Marines back there, where the supplies were, and where they were sitting in holes and other than the four guys protecting me, waiting for me to do something out there ... I\u2019ve said \u201cI don\u2019t think they liked me.\u201d Because not a one of them ever said \u2014 after I expended a flamethrower and rolled out of it, because once you expend it, you just drop it, forget it \u2014 I said they didn\u2019t like me because not a one of them ever said \u201chey, wait out there, I\u2019ll bring you another one.\" (laughs) No, I had to go back and get my other one.  So I made six trips back ... well, five trips [back], really, to get flamethrowers that were already serviced. We always kept a whole bunch of them serviced and ready to go, so that when you needed them they were ready. And that was part of my job as the person in charge of this group. And we had lots of flamethrowers \u2014 25, 30 flamethrowers all the time, sitting around, ready to go.  On killing the enemy  They were not \"people.\" I think if you had thought of them as a fellow human being, for me it would have been very difficult to shoot to kill, even though that's what the Marine Corps said you are going to have to do: If you are going to survive this thing, you are going to have to get them first. But they just became an object ... something that was restricting, something that didn't want you to do what you wanted to do. You lose the sense of a person being another human being. I think you have to do that, or you can't take the life of that person. So where that comes from, I have no explanation for that, except over and over we're told and we're firmly convinced that if you're going to live, you have got to kill him first. Whatever he is. You've got to kill him first. And it loses that identity as another human being.  The Japanese ... and there's a little bit of, I suppose, I don't like to think of it as hate, certainly resentment ... but when we went to Guam, we were told before we got there that the Japanese, when they took Guam in 1942, they killed every American on the island. Well, that builds up ... I don't like to think of it as a hate, I don't even know these people. But it certainly builds up a resentment, and to the point where you're not going to give him an opportunity to do to you what they did to them.  And one of the other things about the Japanese that we resented very strongly is that they would trick people, particularly corpsmen, into thinking they were wounded or needed help, and you'd try to help them, and then they would take their life, and yours too. Because their philosophy of dying was an honor. Our philosophy of dying is not an honor. We've never thought of it as an honor. So as I said, you just look at them as an object that keeps you from being able to do what you want to do, what you're supposed to do, so you have to eliminate that object. I tried not to think of it as a person.  The theory that the Navy didn't do enough shelling of Iwo Jima  That's not true. That really isn't. For the last three days before they hit the beach, it was almost 24-hour, around-the-clock bombing and strafing, and there was nothing left on the top of that island. They had obliterated bushes or trees or anything else. And the Japanese were underground in caves, so it didn't really affect then a great deal. But for three days they really blasted it. And it had been bombed and strafed a number of days before that, because they were flying from carriers and bombing it and strafing it and that sort of thing. Sometimes they would catch Japanese running between holes or on the ground, and they would strafe them, but I have no idea how many tons and tons and tons of ammunition was expended before we got there.  So no, they really did pour the metal to that thing. You read different things, but somewhere around 19 miles of tunnel that had tunneled out of that thing, and some of it down as far as 32 feet below surface level, bombing didn't do anything. Rattled their ears, maybe, but it didn't do anything.  And they had really prepared. He knew we were coming a long time before we ever got there. Because that was in the route. You almost had to go by it to get to Japan. They had holes between pillboxes. They had caves that you could come up in this pillbox and get back in the cave, and go to the next pillbox and come up. So it was just tunnels everywhere. And it was easy digging in the southern part of the island, where the volcanic stuff was. Once we got up north, then the big rocks and the ground got real rough and had huge boulders and that kind of stuff. You could hardly dig a hole up there. It was really hard. Until you broke over the lip, going toward the ocean, then you ran into sand again. It was rough, the territory, the northern part was rough country.  The war ends  I was on Guam. We'd come back to Guam, and had started training on how do you street fight. We'd always been trained in jungle warfare. That's all we had done. Now, while we were on Iwo, the engineers had erected some false-fronted buildings and they weren't streets, but they represent streets between false-fronted buildings to make it look like it's a street, and maybe they'd just have the front on it, or they'd have the front and a side, maybe they'd have an open door and an open window. no doors on it, that type thing. We'd begun training: How do you approach a house? How do you get into a house? How do you go through a door? How do you go through a window? That type of thing. We'd begun training for street fighting.  Well, all we Marines knew we were going to Tokyo. Most of us didn't know there was anything in Japan except Tokyo. 'Cause Tokyo Rose said so. We didn't know.  And so, when the bomb landed [on Nagasaki] on the 8th of August, the war was over! Now we're ready to come home. And of course most of us thought we were going to be shipped back home.  Returning home  In early September, I was called to the first sergeant's office and he said ... all we had over there were khaki shirt and pants. All of our Marine greens had been taken away from us, and of course, dress blues were long gone! Never had any need for dress blues in the Pacific, I'll guarantee you. But we had khaki and dungarees  He said \"put on your best khaki; you're going up to headquarters to see the general.\" Holy cow. Scared me to death. I had no idea why, and I didn't think I had done anything to require me to be reprimanded by a general. I had no idea, and the first sergeant didn't know. They didn't tell him either.  So I got all prepared, and they sent a driver, picked me up, put me in a jeep, off we go to the general's quarters, which was several miles away from where I was. When we got there ... we were living in a tent with the sides rolled up on it, and here he's got an enclosed tent! Stuff out on the ground, and oh boy, I'm in hog heaven ... but scared to death. Absolutely. So I get out of the jeep, and there's a colonel standing there, and I saluted him, snapped to attention, and he said \"you're going in to see the general, and he's what you do.\" And he gave me my instructions.  So I walked in the tent, and he had a rug on the floor. It wasn't very much, but it was a rug. Wasn't dirt like ours, anyway. So I walked up to his desk and snapped to attention, because you don't salute inside in the Marine Corps unless you've got your cover on, unless you're armed. Army, you do. Marine Corps, you don't. So I snapped to attention, he called me at ease, and then began to tell me that \"you are being sent back to the United States, and you're going to be flown back.\" I'd never been on an airplane. \"You're going to be flown back to the United States, and you'll go to go to the White House, and they're going to present you with the Medal of Honor.\"  I had no idea what he was talking about. I'd never heard of the Medal of Honor. I didn't know what it was. All I'm doing is listening. I don't even say \"yes sir\" or nothing. I don't think I ever uttered a sound the whole time I was in there. He said \"you'll be given a set of sealed orders, and make sure you don't open that sealed order until you're told to, or until you get to the next duty station.\" So the colonel was with me. He was standing off to the left. The colonel went and got this big envelope, brown envelope, it was about, I don't know, 15 or 16 inches long, and about 6 or 7 inches wide, and on the back of it \u2014 I didn't see this until I got out \u2014 was a piece of wax about the size of 1 50-cent piece, and in that wax was an \"E\". Didn't know what that was, either. But that was his seal. Erskine was his name; E was his seal, and it was in wax.  So I went back to camp, started packing my gear. Get my sea bag ready, get all my stuff.  Well, I had a .45 that I had picked up somewhere along the way, illegally \u2014 I wasn't supposed to have a .45 \u2014 and I had that in my sea bag. And as I'm packing, some of the guys in the tent said I understand that they now have an X-ray system of some kind that when you go through, they're going to X-ray that sea bag; you'd better not take that .45. I never did figure out whether they were trying to talk me out of my .45 or telling me the truth. But it was false. Anyway, one of them got my .45; I didn't get to bring it home.  So the next day they came and got me, put me in a jeep, took me to the airport. Well, the airport there was just a dirt track and a little hut built out there for the guys who controlled the passengers. So I reported there, and I had a set of orders I could present to show what I was supposed to be doing. I gave him my orders and he said \"have a seat.\" I sat there all day. By evening, I'm still not on an airplane. So there's no place to eat there, there wasn't any place to do anything there. So I went over to the guy and I said \"can you call my first sergeant for me,\" and he said \"oh, yeah.\" I told him what outfit I was in. He called the first sergeant, and I said \"first sergeant, I've been here all day and nobody has said anything to me. What am I supposed to do?\" He said \"I'll send a jeep for you.\"  So he sent a jeep, picked me up, brought me back to camp. I don't know whether somebody missed me or what, but the next morning the first sergeant talked to somebody, and they sent somebody from headquarters, Erskine's office, to pick me up and take me down. That time, I was going on an airplane.  Flew from there to Hawaii, and when I arrived in Hawaii, I was told to report to Marine Corps headquarters there, turn in this envelope. So I did, and the first sergeant took the envelope and disappeared. In a little while he came back and said \"we're going to send you out here to the Navy base. As soon as we can get an airplane seat, why, we'll come and get you and put you on an airplane and send you back to the States.\"  I was out there for seven days. They lost me.  Well, the seventh day, I didn't have anything to do. I'm on a Navy base, there ain't no Marines here, I'm dealing strictly with Navy personnel, and finally a Marine Corps truck comes by. A six-by, one of those big old trucks. And in the window, on the passenger side, there was a sign that said \"no passengers.\" OK. So anyway, I got out in the middle of the street and stopped this guy. And I said \"are you going downtown to near the Marine Corps headquarters?\" and he said \"yeah, that's where I'm going.\" I said \"can I ride with you?\" and he said \"yeah, get in the back.\" So I got in the back \u2014 I'm the only guy back there \u2014 and we go downtown I go back to Marine Corps headquarters, and I walk in.  The same little guy \u2014 we called them clerks; he was a Pfc. in the Marine Corps -- he was sitting there beating on the typewriter. And I walked up to him, and I said \"I'd like to see the first sergeant.\" He looked up at me, and his eyes got great big \u2014 what am I doing here, you know? And he jumped up and ran back down the hallway, and the first sergeant came out. First thing he said when he walked through the door where I was standing: \"What in the H are you doing here?\" (laughs) Because I'm supposed to have already been gone. He got rather excited about that. So they got me a new set of orders real quick, and he personally took me to the airport. 'Cause he had goofed up. I'm convinced that he's the guy that did it.  We got to the airport, and of course planes were very scarce. All of our planes were fighter planes, bombers, or whatever. So there were very few passenger planes. We got to the airport, and airplanes were coming in and out.  He put me in a little waiting room there, and disappeared. That went on and on and on, and finally, about 2 o'clock in the morning, he came and got me and said \"got you a seat.\" Off we go. We go out, and [after the end of blackout restrictions] this place is lit up like a ... all the lights are burning, all the airport and the runway and everything ... just amazing how much light. And a big light shining on that big plane, just as bright as could be.  He said, \"that plane.\"  So, one of the experiences that have haunted me from that day forward: I walked up the ramp, got on the airplane, all the lights on the inside were on, and this is so vivid in my mind ... Here are about 48 individuals who had just been picked up in Japan, released from prison [after] three, four, five years. They were ... some of them [once] weighed 180 pounds, now they weighed 70 or 80 pounds, they looked like skeletons. Hollow cheeks, hollowed eyes. But the happiest group of people I've ever seen in my life. They were really celebrating. And just having a ball, I thought. But that vision has stayed there all my life since.  Finally, my seat was near the bulkhead, right near one of the motors. Of course one of the prisoners was sitting beside me, really skinny guy, and as we took off we got to talking, and I began asking him questions about prison. I had no idea what being a prisoner of war was. We had no information ever furnished to us on how they were treated, or anything like that. So I was asking him about that, and he was describing some of the activities they'd been through, and difficulties that they'd had. One of the things he said to me that's stuck with me ever since: \"You'll never know what freedom is until you have lost it.\" Tears rolled down his cheeks. Never slept between there and Frisco, I'll guarantee ... nobody was sleeping.  So we got to Frisco. Those guys were all headed for Letterman General Hospital in Michigan, where they took the POWs to build them back up again. Well, they had to drop me off in Frisco, because my orders said I had to go to headquarters, Marine Corps, in Frisco. I'm the only guy got off the plane. And this great big tarmac ... I'd never seen a tarmac before. Nobody there to meet me, I had no idea where to go.  I'm in khaki uniform. I'm out of uniform; the Marine Corps had already switched in August from khaki to greens. I started walking across this tarmac, and I see a light in a little building over there. It was shore patrol people. It wasn't dark yet, it was light. I got within 50, 60 yards from that, and these two shore patrol people came out. Didn't ask me who I was, or why I was there or anything, they just walked up and said, \"you're under arrest. You're out of uniform.\"  So they took me in that little hut. So then I showed them my orders, and they didn't know what the Medal of Honor was. They hadn't heard of it either. Anyway, they looked at my orders and saw that I was supposed to be in Oakland, the Marine Corps base. They called over there and asked if they could send a car and get me, and I stayed there in that little hut until the Marine Corps car came and got me, took me over. First thing they did was run me over to the tailor and get me into the proper uniform so I wouldn't be arrested again.  So they cut me a new set of orders then and gave them to me, and reduced my flight eligibility to train eligibility. And it [took] five days at that time; from California to Washington was a five-day trip on a train. Unbelievable. But anyway, they gave me a berth. I got on the train, my berth was the top berth, had no idea of where I'm going or what I'm going to do, nobody to talk to, nothing. But I crawled up in that berth and I'm laying there a few moments \u2014 I hadn't been there very long. Some guy came up. I still had my clothes on, I'm just laying there in my clothes. He takes hold of my pants leg and pulls on it: \"You're in my berth!\" Well he was an Army officer. Am I going to argue with him? No. So I get out of the berth.  About that time the conductor came down through the train, and asked a question, \"can I help?\" or whatever, and this lieutenant said \"this guy was in my berth.\" He said, \"well, what's your berth number?\" He handed him the ticket. He says \"you're in the wrong car.\" (laughs) So I was in the right car and the right berth, but he was in the wrong car. He was in the same berth number in the next car.  So they had a chow car there, and I spent a lot of time drinking coffee in the chow car. I was sitting in there one night, and looked up and here came a guy through the front door that looked like a Southern general. He had boots on, up to his knees, he had a saber on his side, he had a white beard, great big kind of a cavalry hat, and the uniform, of a southern general. And I'm sitting there by myself.  He walked up and asked me if he could sit down with me. Sure. Well, he sat down and began asking me questions \u2014 where have I been, where am I going, yak, yak, yak, you know? \u2014 and we started talking. I explained to him that I'd been overseas 2\u00bd years, and now I'm going home, I'm going to Washington, and I'm going to get this whatever it is, I'm going to go get this thing. I'm due up there on October the third, and this is September 25th or 26th. And he asked me where my home was, and I told him all of that, and in a little while he said, \"I'll be back in a little while.\"  So he got up and left. In a little while he came back, and he had the conductor with him. Introduced the conductor to me, and he said, \"This train does not stop in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. That's not a stop. The last stop was Chicago, and then the next stop is Washington, D.C. Doesn't stop anywhere in between, a direct, through train.\" But the conductor said, \"And you live in Fairmont, West Virginia?\" I said \"Yeah, that's home.\" He said, \"Well, you know, Fairmont's only about 30 miles from Uniontown.\" I said \"Yeah, I know. But I've got to go to Washington, and I'm to report there on the third, but I'm going to be in Washington on the 29th. So I've got some days that I can go home.\" And he said, \"Well, if we slow this train down to three miles an hour in Uniontown, do you think you can get off of it?\" I said, \"You bet your life.\"  So, that's what they did, They slowed that thing down, and I'm standing out on that little step with my little duffel bag. As soon as he got down [in speed], the conductor said \"OK.\" I jumped off that sucker in Uniontown in the middle of the night. No lights are on, nobody's around, no cars. Of course, cars were very scarce then. You didn't have very many cars, 'cause they hadn't made any since 1942. Well, now where do I go? So I just start walking, no sense in standing in one place.  They had people that walked the streets at night called night watchmen. They didn't have any weapon, but they checked doors or whatever. But they did wear a uniform, kind of like a police officer, with a cap kind of like the billed cap of a police officer. So I'm walking down the street and he's on the other side. I ran across the street and said, \"Is there someplace I can get a cup of coffee?\" He said, \"Well, yeah, we've got a USO down here. Open 24 hours. Just go down there.\" He gave me the directions of how to get there.  I went in, only two people there were the people who run the thing, nobody else there. I went in, got a cup of coffee, sat down. A lady came up and started talking to me, one of the employees, and asked me where I was going, that sort of thing. So I told her. She said \"Well, I get of at 6. If you just stick around here, I'll drive you from here to Morgantown, which is only about 15 miles away, then you can catch a bus from there to Fairmont.\" OK. So I sat there and drank coffee and ate doughnuts until 6:00, then she put me in her car, drove me over to Morgantown, and I caught a bus.  The bus was ready to leave when I got there. I got on the bus, and my eventual wife, the girlfriend I'd been engaged to ever since I went into the Marine Corps, lived between Morgantown and Fairmont. And this bus went right by her house. Now, isn't that a miracle?  So we're driving down the road \u2014 there weren't many people on the bus because it was early in the morning -- so I asked the bus driver, \"Can you stop this bus and let me off at Meadow Dale?\" He said, \"Well, sure. Just tell me when.\" So we got down in front of her house, and I said to him, \"Can you let me off right here?\" and he let me off. Seven o'clock in the morning, I walked up and knocked on her door. Talk about a surprise, because they had no idea where I was, or nothing. They thought I was still overseas.  Well, that was my homecoming.  Receiving the Medal of Honor  I've said many times, I don't know if I was more scared then than I was in combat. I know my body shook more. I was so frightened that my body would not be still. I've had this experience a couple of my times in my life when I had a near-accident or something. After it's over, your body shakes. That's the way I was when I went up to the president. Shaking so that my body wouldn't stand still, and I'd roll up on my toes to try to keep it quiet, and back on my heels to try to keep it quiet, and they read the whole citation. It seems like it's forever and ever and ever that you're standing there.  When they finish with the citation, someone brings him over the medal, and he takes the medal, and ... he did it differently then than they do today. Today the president stands behind the person and puts it on. That didn't happen there. He pinned it from the front. Well, if you've ever seen the Medal of Honor hook, finding that little hole to put that little thing in is a very difficult thing in the beginning. When you're doing it behind someone's back it's even more difficult. So he had quite a difficult time trying to find that little hole in that ribbon. But eventually he did, and when he got it pinned, why of course he shook hands and he said to me, as he said to every one of us \u2014 there were 13 of us there that day \u2014 \"I would rather have this medal than to be president.\" And he said this over and over to the people who received it. He said that to me. I made no response. I was so scared I couldn't even think, let alone respond.  One of the fellows receiving the medal the same day I did was a 17-year-old Marine, Jack Lucas, and Jack never had a bashful day in his life, I don't think. And the story is that when he said that to Jack \u2014 and we went alphabetical, so I was next to last. A guy named Zimmer was last of the 13. So Jack was about half way through. When he said that to Jack, Jack's response was, \"I'll trade you.\" (laughs) I could've never done that. That's not my nature.  Jack Lucas probably gave me more reasons to remember than any other [Medal of Honor recipient]. After Jack and I received the medal, I was 22 years old, Jack was 17. He sort of latched onto me as his mentor \u2014 we didn't even know that word back in those days, but Jack would confide in me, he would ask me advice, that type thing. He became almost like a son. So if he got in trouble, who'd he call? Me. And I've got him out of more troubles than I could remember. But he had the greatest impact on my life as any other member of the [Medal of Honor] society.  After the war  After World War II, when we all came home, we had a similar condition. We didn't call it PTSD back then. That term hadn't come up. We called it \"psychoneurosis.\" And we had a number of people who came home with that condition, which is exactly the same as PTSD. But there were no treatment facilities, psychiatry hadn't really gotten going yet. All we had were mental hospitals that hospitalized the people the court said could not maintain their affairs and that type of thing. And most World War II guys weren't, certainly, to that point. But most of us had what we now call PTSD. Couldn't do much about it. And for years, dreams and anxieties were part of life.  One of the things that helped me most was receiving the Medal of Honor. That seems strange, maybe., but when I received the Medal of Honor, rather than going back to the farm as a timid, shy country boy with no help, I became a public figure. I didn't want to do that; that certainly wasn't in my goals, to become a public figure. But the mere fact that I did, and I represented something bigger than me, greater than me, and represented those guys that didn't get to come home ... that put me in a position where I had to express myself. People wouldn't let me alone. All kinds of questions; constantly in the public. 'What did you do? How did you [earn the medal]? These kinds of things. I had to talk about it, or go dig myself a hole and stay in it.  And we had veterans who did that. Went off by themselves, and wouldn't have any association with anybody. But the mere fact that I had to do that was my therapy. Really, it absolutely helped me. I still had the nightmares; a gun went off someplace, I'm getting ready to fight again, but the severity of it continued to go down.  I had a brother that was in the Battle of the Bulge, and he cracked up. What we called in World War II a crackup. They absolutely lose all control of their presence. They cry, they shake, they do all these things that we called crackup. He did that, and they sent him to a mental hospital in England during the Battle of the Bulge. Apparently he was in pretty bad shape; they kept him there until after the war. He didn't get home until March of 1946. They kept him in that mental hospital. No word ever came back to my mother. My father died when I was 9 years old, but my mother raised all of us kids. But no word ever came back to her as to his condition. Nothing. She just knew he was in a hospital. She didn't even know it was a mental hospital.  When he came home, he was in much worse shape than I was. His psychosis was much deeper, prevalent than mine. And he didn't live very long.  So as time went on, I knew from the beginning, I guess, I was one of the most fortunate people in the world, because I had an awful lot of guys around me that were killed and I wasn't. There had to be some kind of a reason for this ... why me? And I kept asking myself that question ... why me? Why am I doing this? Why am I receiving this when others did as much or gave more than I did? It was a very difficult thing to evaluate.  I wouldn't go to church. My wife was raised as a Christian girl from the time she was born, she raised our two daughters as Christian daughters, but I wouldn't go to church with her. I didn't need God. I'm a Marine! I'm self sufficient! Whew.  But they kept after me, and as the girls got older, back in those days at Easter time we would always buy new clothes for them and dress them up in the finery of Easter. You only did it for one day, and I used to resent that terribly. Why is she spending all this money for one day? It didn't make any sense to me. But they kept after me, and in 1962 they finally wore me down and I said \"OK, I'll go.\"  But when we went into the church, I found a pew that didn't have anybody in it, and I put them in first, and I sat on the aisle. Because if that guy gets hackin' on me, I'm leaving, you know? I've got an escape route already planned out.  But God had a different plan. That day He spoke to me, and made me realize, \"Hey. you're here because I let you be here. You're here because I saved your life. And so, I went forward and dedicated my life to God, and I've been serving my lord ever since. That was 1962.  I don't put a whole lot of work into [preaching]. I meditate about it and just say \"God, what do you want me to say? You're the boss.\"  The cost of battle  I don't know how you can prepare for something that is not real in your mind. As we grew up as children \u2014 and I assume this still goes on; it does in my family \u2014 you were taught \"you do not kill.\" I was taught that, and taught that the only time you kill is when you have to have something to eat, or you've got an animal that's in misery and you want to get it out of its misery. But just to wantonly kill something \u2014 you don't do that.  I did it a few times as a kid with a slingshot, and killed a bird, and I got caught a few times, and I got a whippin' for it. \"What'd that bird do to you?\" So we were brought up that way, and then all of a sudden we go into the military, and our complete thought process starts another way: If you're going to survive, you've got to kill. It's a very difficult transition.  And then, in my case and World War II cases mostly, when you came home they handed you a piece of paper and said \"OK, we're done with you. We don't need you any more. So you go back to where you were prior to World War II.\" Overnight you're supposed to make that transition, and that's a tough thing to do. Almost impossible. And those things that happened to you during that period of war, they're there. They're not going to be erased just overnight.  So PTSD ... the word post-traumatic doesn't quite set it with me. I don't fully understand what we're saying when we say post-traumatic. Well, war is traumatic. No question about it. And if you come out of the war, then you're in the beginning and the past is done. I wish they had come up with a different term than \"post-traumatic.\" \"Battle fatigue\" that came out of Korea, to me, fits the situation so much better than PTSD. Battle fatigue. you really reach that point in time in battle. Some can't take it, some live with it forever. I like that ... I don't like that term, but I would prefer their using that term, \"battle fatigue.\"  [\"Disorder\"] never quite fit. I can see a reason ... I'm not smart, but I can see a reason why the so-called PTSD or the battle fatigue is greater from Iraq and Afghanistan than it was in World War II or Korea, Vietnam ... because when you put limitations on a person whose life is in danger and say \"you can't shoot until you're shot at,\" the stress is ... I would think that I'd be in trouble. I don't believe I could control that. I believe that if somebody was threatening my life, I'm going to shoot first. I'm not going to pay any attention to that \"rules of engagement\" stuff. I'm going to protect my life. That's human nature. That's the way we are.  Often I speak to state police graduating classes, and I tell those guys, \"you know, you face more stress every day than I did when I was in combat.\" When my commanding officer told me, \"OK, we're going to be on the attack today, we're going to be the pushers,\" I knew I was going to be shot at. I knew somebody's going to try to kill me. But I was prepared for that. And I had the wherewithal to attempt to protect myself.  A state trooper, when he walks out of his house in the morning, he has no idea whether he's going to get home that night. And that has got to be a very stressful situation. But do we hear of PTSD in state troopers? No. I've never seen one that they diagnosed with that, you know? But you know it's got to be there.  And firemen are in the same classification ... when you run out of that fire department and head for that house, you don't know whether you're going to fall through the floor, or whatever. And they face that with less protection than what we did when we were in combat. I just don't think I'd ever want to be a policeman or a fireman (laughs).

For additional prevention tips, visit www.floridahealthcovid19.gov/prevention FDA Warns Consumers of Risk of Methanol Contamination in Certain Hand Sanitizers FDA is warning consumers and health care providers that the agency has seen a sharp increase in hand sanitizer products that are labeled to contain ethanol (also known as ethyl alcohol) but that have tested positive for methanol contamination. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a substance that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin or ingested and can be life-threatening when ingested. Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing methanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate treatment for potential reversal of toxic effects of methanol poisoning. Substantial methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death. Although all persons using these products on their hands are at risk for methanol poisoning, young children who accidently ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute, are most at risk. FDA recommends consumers stop using these hand sanitizers and dispose of them immediately in appropriate hazardous waste containers. Do not flush or pour these products down the drain. FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA\u2019s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program. Complete and submit the report online or download and complete the form , then submit it via fax at 1-800-FDA-0178.

Because many businesses have been closed during the COVID-19 State of Emergency, water has not been used and has remained in meter-to-building pipes for several weeks. The CDC and regulatory agencies advise that stagnant or standing water may cause conditions that increase the risk for the growth and spread of Legionella and other biofilm-associated bacteria. This advisory includes hot and cold-water systems, cooling towers, hot tubs, pools, spas, water heaters as well as decorative fountains. Following the Centers\u2019 for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines may greatly reduce chances for Legionella and other opportunistic waterborne microbes from developing within plumbing systems and devices. Businesses owners with questions regarding the CDC recommendations regarding water systems may call the Florida Department of Health at 305-324-2400.

Lupus is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks its own tissues. People with lupus are at higher risk of infections, and those with lupus who develop COVID-19 may be at higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some treatments for lupus may also increase the risk of infections or severe complications from infections. Prevention is one of the most important tools against COVID-19, and there are some extra steps to consider for people with compromised immune systems. It is important for people with lupus to work closely with their doctors to find workable treatments for their symptoms in each case. Keep reading to learn more about how COVID-19 may affect a person with lupus, including what the research says so far, the risks, and some important considerations to help keep them safe. FDA NOTICE The FDA have removed the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on a review of the latest research, the FDA determined that these drugs are not likely to be an effective treatment for COVID-19 and that the risks of using them for this purpose might outweigh any benefits. How does COVID-19 affect people with lupus? Share on Pinterest If a person takes immunosuppressant drugs to treat lupus, they may have a higher risk of COVID-19. The symptoms of lupus itself can vary widely in each case, from mild to severe or even life threatening. Because of this, the treatments necessary to control the symptoms will also vary widely. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common form of lupus. Other types include discoid, drug-induced, and neonatal lupus. Just as the symptoms of lupus vary, an individual\u2019s reaction to COVID-19 will also vary. SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory virus that causes COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the symptoms of COVID-19 may appear 2\u201314 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms can include: a fever a dry cough shortness of breath a sore throat a headache muscle pain chills new loss of taste or smell The World Health Organization (WHO) state that other symptoms can include: general fatigue gastrointestinal symptoms The infection may have a longer incubation period in some cases. During this time, the person may not notice any symptoms at all. A person can also pass the virus on before any symptoms develop. Some symptoms of COVID-19 may mimic those of SLE. For instance, fatigue is a common symptom of both COVID-19 and lupus. Also, in people with SLE who struggle with fatigue, a SARS-CoV-2 infection may make fatigue worse. Is COVID-19 more dangerous for people with lupus? People with SLE are more at risk of infections and serious complications from these infections. This includes SARS-CoV-2. Some people with SLE may take immunosuppressant drugs to manage their symptoms. These drugs themselves can also increase a person\u2019s risk of infections. A person with lupus who also has other risk factors \u2014 such as being over 65, living in a long-term care facility, or having another medical condition associated with lupus \u2014 may be at a greater risk of severe illness. People with a greater risk of severe illness may be more likely to experience complications or severe symptoms from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms to look out for It is important for people with SLE to pay attention to the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 so that their doctors can respond quickly. Some symptoms, such as fatigue, may be difficult to notice. It is therefore important to keep an eye out for other common symptoms of infection, such as a fever, difficulty breathing, or a dry cough. It is especially important for people with compromised immune systems to keep an eye out for more severe symptoms of COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing, a constant feeling of pressure in the chest, or a change to the color of their face or lips. These symptoms require urgent medical care. On April 21, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of the first COVID-19 home testing kit. Using the cotton swab provided, people will be able to collect a nasal sample and mail it to a designated laboratory for testing. The emergency use authorization specifies that the test kit is authorized for use by people who healthcare professionals have identified as having suspected COVID-19. Extra care and precautions for people with lupus People with SLE should pay close attention to their triggers at this time and take measures to avoid them. Individual triggers will vary in each case but may include stress, exposure to sunlight, and some foods or medications. If a person knows their triggers, it can help them prevent flare-ups and keep lupus in remission. People with SLE should also be certain that they have a supply of any medications they need to take. Having a 90-day supply of any medication they need should ensure that the person has access to treatment, even if they need to go into self-isolation or quarantine. General precautions Anyone who thinks they may have COVID-19 or may have had exposure to SARS-CoV-2 should take steps to help prevent the spread. A period of self-isolation can help reduce the spread of the illness by reducing the points of contact the virus has. People who experience any form of sickness, including symptoms of common respiratory conditions, should stay home. There are also a number of other important prevention tips to keep in mind, including: getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated washing hands regularly with warm water and soap, and lathering for at least 20 seconds using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available cleaning and disinfecting all household areas that see regular use avoiding public transportation avoiding public spaces staying at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people Additionally, the CDC now recommend that people use cloth face coverings when in public as an additional step in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Treatment and symptom management There is currently no cure for COVID-19. Symptom management suggestions include: taking acetaminophen for pain and fever drinking plenty of fluids and eating small but frequent nutritious meals getting adequate rest and engaging only in activities that do not cause overtiredness It is important to keep SLE under control by taking any medications a doctor prescribes and avoiding all known triggers. Lupus medication for treating COVID-19 As one recent study notes, early reports suggest that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are common treatments for SLE, could have the potential to treat COVID-19. Research groups are currently investigating these drugs, and more studies are necessary to confirm the results before making any firm claims. That said, two doctors note that the use of these treatments may impact people with SLE who already use these drugs for treatment, as there may be shortages. The Lupus Foundation of America have urged manufacturers to increase the supply of these drugs so that people with lupus will continue to have access to them. A separate study in The Lancet Rheumatology notes that although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved the drug for off-label use in some cases of COVID-19, the excitement may be premature. People with lupus who rely on these drugs to treat their symptoms should talk to their doctor or pharmacist about how to ensure that they have access to this medication. What to do if you test positive A person with lupus who tests positive for COVID-19 should work closely with their doctor throughout the course of the illness. They may schedule an appointment via phone or video call to discuss the treatment options. In some cases, the person may need to go to the doctor\u2019s office. A person should not stop taking any lupus medications unless a doctor advises it. Suddenly stopping a medication may lead to a flare-up of symptoms, which puts additional stress on the body. Continue to practice prevention measures as much as possible, only leaving the house to seek medical care. Any time a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 leaves the house, they should wear a protective face mask. Outlook A report from the WHO notes that around 80% of confirmed COVID-19 cases cause mild-to-moderate symptoms. These mild cases may respond well to rest, spending time in the home, and other forms of symptom management. That said, people with autoimmune conditions such as lupus are at greater risk of infections and serious complications from them. In more severe cases, a person may require hospitalization. In critical cases, a person may experience life threatening complications, such as respiratory failure or organ failure.",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the illness COVID-19, which may lead to mild to severe respiratory problems. These symptoms may mean people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a higher risk of more severe illness from COVID-19 due to their existing lung problems. In this article, we look at how COVID-19 may affect people with COPD, symptoms to look for, and extra precautions people with COPD can take. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. COVID-19 and COPD? Share on Pinterest During the COVID-19 outbreak, a person with COPD should stay at home except for essential medical care. According to a 2020 report of 140 people with COVID-19, having COPD does not make people any more likely to contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, if a person with COPD contracts the virus, they may be more likely to experience breathlessness. This means that hospitalization may also be more likely. Despite this, according to one expert from the European Lung Foundation, most people with COPD may experience no symptoms or mild symptoms and make a complete recovery. How dangerous is it for those with COPD? People with severe COPD may have a higher risk of COVID-19 complications as COVID-19 affects the respiratory system. Existing lung damage means it is more difficult for the lungs to fight off an infection. According to a meta-analysis of seven studies, the researchers concluded that those with COPD may have a significantly increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections. A 2020 case series from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention documented the coronavirus outbreak in China. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3%, which means there were 1,023 deaths in 44,672 confirmed cases of COVID-19. In people with chronic respiratory disease, the CFR was 6.3%. A person with COPD should not stop taking their treatments, including corticosteroids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Symptoms Common symptoms of COVID-19 include: a fever breathlessness a cough muscle pain a sore throat a headache chills new loss of taste or smell People may develop symptoms 2\u201314 days after exposure to novel coronavirus. Extra precautions to take People with COPD should continue their treatment for COPD as usual during the COVID-19 outbreak. They should keep at least a 30-day supply of any prescription medication and preferably a 90-day supply. People can check with their oxygen provider to ensure that their routine oxygen supply will continue as usual. An individual can also take the following precautions: Stay at home except for essential medical care. If absolutely necessary to go out, stay 6 feet away from others. Wash hands regularly, and particularly after being in a public place, with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. Make sure to have enough food and everyday supplies in the house. Where possible, get items delivered or ask others to drop items off to avoid excess travel. Avoid contact with others wherever possible. If people live with others who are leaving and entering the home, make sure they frequently wash their hands for 20 seconds with warm water and soap. If people require external home help or healthcare visits, ensure these individuals are taking all necessary hygiene precautions. Clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch frequently, such as door handles, countertops, and bathroom surfaces. Avoid touching the face with unwashed hands. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or elbow, then discard tissues straightaway. Quitting smoking can help to strengthen the respiratory system against COVID-19. How to manage COPD symptoms It is important that people manage their COPD symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. People can create a management plan with a healthcare team. This can help them keep track of medication, monitor COPD symptoms, and check that symptoms are not worsening. A person can call their doctor to discuss this over the phone if they do not already have a plan in place. Eating a healthful diet and drinking plenty of water can also help to support the body and remove excess mucus from the lungs. Some people may find that eating fewer carbohydrates and more healthful fats improve their breathing. The American Lung Association have a selection of breathing exercises that may help ease shortness of breath and relax the airways. Asking others for help and talking with friends, family, or healthcare professionals can help maintain emotional and mental health. What to do after a positive test? If people with COPD test positive for COVID-19, it is important that they follow the guidelines to help protect themselves and others against the virus. If someone has severe symptoms of COVID-19, they may require treatment in the hospital. Once people inform their doctor of a positive test result for COVID-19, a doctor will be able to assess their symptoms and advise the next steps. If people have mild symptoms, they may be able to treat and relieve symptoms at home. If people have COVID-19, it is important they self-isolate. This means staying at home and limiting contact with others, as much as possible. These restrictions can help reduce the risk of spreading the virus. If people are sharing a home with others, they can take care to stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible. People with COVID-19 should also wear a face mask when around others. If people have any of the following symptoms, they should seek medical help immediately: difficulty breathing persistent pressure or pain in the chest new state of confusion lips or face turn bluish What treatment is available? Currently, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and will depend on the individual and severity of illness. People may be able to treat mild symptoms at home by following their usual COPD treatment plan and carefully monitoring their symptoms. For more severe cases, people will need treatment in a hospital to treat or prevent complications. Occasionally, people may require supplemental oxygen and advanced support for the respiratory system and other organs.",

COVID-19, the disease the novel coronavirus causes, can spread to the lungs, causing pneumonia. While many people recover, some develop severe pneumonia that does not respond well to treatment. In this article, we look at the relationship between COVID-19 and pneumonia, the treatment available, and precautions a person should take. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. How does COVID-19 affect the lungs? People with COVID-19 pneumonia experience changes in their lungs, including: inflammation that may be so severe, it damages the lungs\u2019 alveoli fluid accumulation in the lungs gas exchange difficulties that make it hard to get enough oxygen or expel enough carbon dioxide fluid leaking out of blood vessels in the lungs Symptoms of pneumonia The symptoms of pneumonia can vary from mild to severe. However, typical symptoms include: coughing loss of appetite nausea vomiting shortness of breath fever difficulty breathing deeply Pneumonia is severe when a person is having difficulty breathing and experiences respiratory distress. How do doctors diagnose pneumonia To diagnose pneumonia, doctors typically perform imaging scans to look for swelling, inflammation, or fluid in the lungs. Although, sometimes, a diagnosis is possible without any imaging. CT scans can diagnose pneumonia, though some doctors may recommend an X-ray or another type of scan. To test for COVID-19, doctors can take a swab from the nose and the mouth. Treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia According to the CDC, inpatient care for those with severe cases of COVID-19 typically focuses on managing the complications. If a doctor suspects that a person is experiencing pneumonia, they may prescribe antibiotics even though this will not treat COVID-19. People with more severe pneumonia may need to stay in the hospital. While in the hospital, a person may receive intravenous (IV) fluids and monitoring. People with breathing difficulties may need a ventilator or oxygen therapy. Precautions to take To avoid contracting the coronavirus or transmitting it to someone else, a person should: Avoid contact: They should avoid contact with people outside their own household, as much as possible. When contact is unavoidable, they should maintain a safe 6-foot distance from other people. They must also avoid physical contact with others, including shaking hands.

People who have or believe they have COVID-19 should take the following additional precautions: Avoid other people, including those in the same home. Wear a face covering when around other people. Isolate in a single room and when using the bathroom to avoid spreading germs. Do not share personal care products. Practice good self-care by getting plenty of rest, eating regularly, and drinking lots of fluids. Call a doctor if symptoms are severe. Does the pneumonia vaccine prevent COVID-19 pneumonia? According to the WHO, the pneumonia vaccine does not protect against the new coronavirus. As yet, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 either. Vaccines for pneumonia only prevent certain types of pneumonia, such as pneumococcal pneumonia. However, these immunizations may help prevent other serious illnesses, including infections a person may contract while in hospital. Learn more about pneumonia vaccines here. When to see a doctor There is no cure for COVID-19 at the current time. Treatment focuses instead on managing symptoms. People who think they have COVID-19 do not need to see a doctor for testing or treatment unless they are severely ill. People who become severely ill should call a doctor ahead of time to reduce the risk of spreading the disease to others. People who cannot breathe or who feel chest tightness or other serious symptoms, such as shortness of breath or a blue tinge to the lips, should call 911 or go to the emergency room. When calling 911, a person should tell the operator that they may have COVID-19, so first responders can take precautionary measures. Outlook According to the CDC, as of March 2020, the outlook for severe COVID-19 illness appears to increase, depending on a person\u2019s age: Age (years) Fatality rate (%) \u226419 0 20\u201354 <1% 55\u201364 1\u20133% 65\u201384 3\u201311% \u226585 10\u201327%",

                              "text": "COVID-19 is a novel illness that affects a person\u2019s lungs and airways. People with bronchitis may be wondering what COVID-19 means for them. Bronchitis refers to inflammation of the main airways of the lungs, or the bronchi. People with bronchitis may be at risk of serious illness if they develop COVID-19 after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus. This is similar to what happens if they get the flu. However, much remains unknown about the effects of COVID-19 on those with bronchitis. This is because it is a new disease around which there is limited information available. Read on to learn more about the potential risks of COVID-19 for those with bronchitis, including precautions people can take to reduce their risk of developing it. How does COVID-19 affect people with bronchitis? Share on Pinterest As COVID-19 affects the respiratory tract, people with bronchitis should take extra care to avoid contracting the virus that causes it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people with certain underlying health conditions may be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 \u2014 especially if they do not have these conditions under control. This includes people with chronic lung disease. Chronic bronchitis, which is bronchitis that persists for several months or keeps coming back, is a form of chronic lung disease. Specifically, it is part of a serious lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Bronchitis does not cause COVID-19, and based on current information, it does not appear to increase a person\u2019s risk of developing the disease. However, having chronic bronchitis may increase a person\u2019s risk of developing severe illness if they do contract the virus. Like bronchitis, COVID-19 affects the respiratory tract, including the lungs. It can therefore lead to pneumonia or acute respiratory disease. The novel coronavirus may also cause acute, or short-term, bronchitis symptoms in people who contract the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other experts are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people with preexisting medical conditions. Is COVID-19 more dangerous for people with bronchitis? Currently, there is little information about the effects of COVID-19 on people with bronchitis. However, several other coronaviruses can cause symptoms that resemble those of colds and flus. Research indicates that the flu can frequently worsen cases of COPD. Cold symptoms may also make COPD symptoms worse. Both bronchitis and COVID-19 can affect the lungs. This may mean that COVID-19 is more dangerous for those with bronchitis. The CDC also indicate that the novel coronavirus may cause more severe illness in those with preexisting lung conditions, such as bronchitis. Symptoms to look out for According to the WHO, the most common COVID-19 symptoms are: a dry cough fatigue fever Other symptoms may include: aches and pains diarrhea difficulty breathing or shortness of breath nasal congestion a runny nose a sore throat Some people may also experience a loss of taste or smell. However, neither the CDC nor the WHO have adopted this as an official symptom yet. Symptoms are typically mild and their onset is gradual, appearing within 2\u201314 days of exposure to the virus. Some people develop more severe symptoms, while others do not have any symptoms at all. Some symptoms of the novel coronavirus are similar to those of bronchitis. It can therefore be challenging to differentiate between the two conditions. People who notice any change or worsening in their bronchitis symptoms should err on the side of caution and call their doctor. Extra care and precautions People can take some steps to reduce their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For example, they should: Maintain a physical distance of 6 feet (2 meters) from other people, especially those who are unwell. Avoid crowds where possible. Avoid all nonessential travel. Wash the hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces in the home, such as door handles, keys, remote controls, and faucets, regularly. Avoid sharing personal items, such as cutlery and towels. Stock up on food, medicines, and other essential supplies to reduce the number of trips to the drugstore and grocery store. Have sick members of the household isolate themselves as much as possible until their symptoms resolve. Keep bronchitis symptoms under control by following a prescribed treatment plan. People who believe that they have come into contact with the virus should: monitor their symptoms closely take their temperature every day to check for fever call their doctor immediately if symptoms occur seek urgent medical attention if breathing difficulties or chest pain develop Treatment and symptom management The CDC say that there is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/asthma.html\u201d>no specific treatment or antiviral medication for COVID-19 at present. To best prevent illness, a person should reduce their risk of exposure to the virus. In people who develop the disease, treatment aims to alleviate symptoms. Options include: cough medications fluids pain relievers rest People with severe illness will require hospitalization. Their medical team may need to administer oxygen, put them on a ventilator, or provide them with other forms of specialist care. To date, there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19, though experts are investigating some development options. People with bronchitis who develop COVID-19 may also need to continue their bronchitis treatment while they have the virus. It is important that they work with their doctor to do this. What to do if the test is positive If a person tests positive for COVID-19, their doctor will provide them with instructions to help them recover and to reduce the spread of the virus to others. Those with mild symptoms can often recover at home, by resting, drinking fluids, and taking medications. However, people with severe illness will require hospital treatment. Anyone who develops COVID-19 will need to isolate as much as possible from others, including loved ones. They will need to use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if possible, and use separate personal items, such as cutlery and towels. A doctor will be able to provide specific guidance based on individual circumstances. Outlook Because so little is known about COVID-19 at present, it is difficult to determine the outlook for people who develop the disease. In general, the outlook seems to depend on factors such as: the severity of the disease the person\u2019s age the presence of any underlying health conditions Severe cases can result in complications, such as pneumonia, organ failure, or death. However, most people will have mild or moderate symptoms and recover well. Receiving prompt medical treatment can also help improve the outlook and reduce the risk of complications for people with severe disease. Current research indicates that around 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild-to-moderate disease, 13.8% develop severe disease, and 6.1% reach a critical stage requiring intensive care.",

Although anyone can get it, most people who become severely ill or die from COVID-19 have serious underlying illnesses. Because the disease is new, researchers have not performed any specific research on multiple sclerosis (MS) and COVID-19. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, there is no evidence that people with MS face a higher risk of COVID-19. However, people who need to attend regular medical appointments may be at greater risk of exposure to the virus. Some MS symptoms may make people more vulnerable to serious COVID-19 symptoms. Learn more about how COVID-19 might affect people with MS in this article. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. How does COVID-19 affect people with MS? Share on Pinterest A person with MS is unlikely to have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Having MS does not necessarily increase the risk of contracting the virus or developing complications from COVID-19. However, certain people with MS may be at higher risk, including those with: Mobility problems MS slowly damages nerves, which interferes with the brain\u2019s ability to communicate with the muscles. This can affect many aspects of daily life, including movement. People with advanced MS may have severe mobility issues. Mobility issues may complicate COVID-19 in several ways: A person who is sedentary or who spends most of their time lying down or sitting in a wheelchair may suffer other health issues, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Both of these conditions may increase a person\u2019s chances of developing COVID-19. Spending most of the day lying down or in bed may cause respiratory secretions to accumulate. This can cause breathing problems and aspiration pneumonia, which may intensify the effects of COVID-19. The body\u2019s natural immune response to infections may make other symptoms of MS worse, including breathing and mobility issues. Lung health issues Some people with MS develop breathing or lung health issues. This can happen when a person is no longer able to control the muscles that support breathing. MS may also make it more difficult to clear the mucus and other fluids in the airway, which might increase the risk of pneumonia. Some MS medications may also affect breathing, especially opioids and certain other pain medicines. These drugs may slow breathing. People with lung or breathing issues due to MS may be more likely to develop COVID-19 complications, though no specific research has examined this hypothesis. Immunosuppressants Because MS is an autoimmune disease, many MS drugs target the immune system. Some immunomodulating drugs also weaken the immune system. People who take these medications may have a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and experiencing prolonged and more severe infections. There is no evidence that people with MS should stop taking their medication. Doing so may make MS symptoms worse and may increase a person\u2019s vulnerability to severe infections. People with MS must discuss medication options with a neurologist or other doctor. Is COVID-19 more dangerous for people with MS? No current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is more dangerous for people with MS. Specific people with MS may, however, face a higher risk. A person might experience more complications if they have: breathing problems mobility issues pain fatigue People over the age of 60 face the most significant risk from COVID-19. While some younger people with underlying conditions have died from COVID-19, the overwhelming majority of deaths have been among older adults. Death rates increase with each decade of age. An article in The Lancet indicated that 13.4% of people over 80 with the virus in China died. Symptoms COVID-19 is similar to a severe cold or flu at first. Some people do not experience any symptoms at all. According to an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, some symptoms that could indicate that a person has COVID-19 include: a fever a cough, especially a dry or unproductive cough shortness of breath Symptoms can vary from person to person and may be similar to cold or flu symptoms. Learn more about the symptoms of COVID-19 here. Extra care and precautions According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a person with MS should take the following steps to reduce their risk of getting COVID-19: Avoid unnecessary medical appointments. Ask a doctor about telehealth services and delaying non-vital procedures. Ask a doctor about telehealth services and delaying non-vital procedures. Stock up on prescription drugs. Ask a doctor to prescribe for 3 months of medication if possible. Ask a doctor to prescribe for 3 months of medication if possible. Practice frequent hand washing.

Maintain physical distance: Keep at least 6 feet away from others when in public. Keep at least 6 feet away from others when in public. Understand personal risk factors: Talk to a doctor about individual risk factors and strategies to avoid getting sick. Treatment There is currently no cure for COVID-19. Instead, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and reducing the risk of severe complications. People with severe symptoms may need to stay in the hospital or move to the intensive care unit (ICU). Some people need to use a ventilator so that they can breathe. If a person develops a secondary infection, such as bacterial pneumonia, they may need antibiotics. For mild to moderate illness, treatment is similar to the common cold or flu. People can recover by staying home, resting, and drinking plenty of fluids. People with COVID-19 should avoid others, and if they live in a home with other people, they should remain quarantined as much as possible. This is not possible for everyone, including some people with MS that require help or care from others. What to do if you test positive People with MS who test positive should: Talk to a doctor about the next steps. Some people may need to change their MS medication, but avoid doing this without first talking to a doctor.
