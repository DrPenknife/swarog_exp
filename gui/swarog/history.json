                              "text": "The Hard Working American vs. The Government Parasite By Michael Snyder, on April 10th, 2012 \nWhich lifestyle choice produces better results \u2013 being a hard working American or being a government parasite? Actually, when you look at the cold, hard numbers they may just surprise you. In America today, we deeply penalize hard work and we greatly reward government dependence. If you live in a very liberal area of the country and you know how to game the system, it is entirely possible to live a comfortable existence without ever working too much at all. In fact, there are some Americans that have been living off of \u201cgovernment benefits\u201d for decades. Many of these people actually plan their lives around doing exactly what they need to do to qualify for as many benefits as possible. America is rapidly turning into a European-style socialist welfare state and it is destroying our nation socially and financially. Ever since the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d began our debt has absolutely exploded and yet now there are more poor people in this country than ever before. Obviously something is not working. \nNow don\u2019t get me wrong. I deeply believe in having compassion for those that are going through tough times and having a safety net for those that cannot take care of themselves. We should not have a single person in this nation going without food or sleeping in the streets. \nBut in America today it is absolutely ridiculous how many people are climbing aboard the \u201csafety net\u201d. At this point, an astounding 49 percent of all Americans live in a home that receives some form of government benefits. \nSo who pays for all of this? \nThe people that drag themselves out of bed and go to work each day pay for it all. \nFor a few moments, let\u2019s examine how the lifestyle of a typical hard working American compares to the lifestyle of a government parasite. \nIn America today, the median yearly household income is somewhere around $50,000. About half of all American households make more than that and about half of all American households make less than that. When you break it down, it comes to about $4000 a month. \nSo how far does $4000 go in America today? \nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t go very far at all. \nFirst of all, a hard working American family will need some place to live. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the decent jobs are near the big cities, and it is more expensive to live near the big cities. Let\u2019s assume that an average family of four will spend about $1000 a month on rent or on a mortgage payment. \nThe government parasite, on the other hand, has a whole host of federal, state and local housing programs to take advantage of. During the recent economic downturn, more Americans than ever have been turning to the government for help with housing costs. For example, federal housing assistance outlays increased by a whopping 42 percent between 2006 and 2010. \nOnce you have a place to live, you have to provide power and heat for it. For the average hard working American, this is going to probably average about $300 a month, although this can vary greatly depending on where you live. \nFor the government parasite, there are once again a whole host of government programs to help with this. For example, LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program) assists low income households in paying their home heating bills. \nMost average hard working Americans are also going to need phone and Internet service. Let\u2019s assume that the hard working family of four in our example is extremely thrifty and only spends $100 a month for these services. \nFor the government parasite, cell phone service is not a problem. As I have written about previously , those that \u201cqualify\u201d can receive a free cell phone and free cell phone minutes every single month from the federal government. In addition, in some areas of the nation low income families can qualify for deeply subsidized home Internet service . \nIn order to earn money, our hard working family is going to need to get to work. In most households, both parents have decided to work these days so both of them will need cars. Let\u2019s assume that the family is very thrifty and that both cars were purchased used and that the car payments only total about $400 a month. \nThe hard working family will also need auto insurance for the two vehicles. Let\u2019s assume that both parents have a great driving record and that they only pay a total of about $100 a month for car insurance. \nThe cars will also need to be filled up with gasoline. The average U. S. household spent $4155 on gasoline during 2011, but let\u2019s assume that our family is very, very careful and that they only spend about $300 on gas each month. \nSo what about the government parasite? Well, the government parasite does not need to go to work, so this expense can potentially be eliminated entirely. But since most other things are paid for by the government or are deeply subsidized, in many instances government parasites are actually able to afford very nice vehicles. \nIn addition, a new bill (The Low-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act) has been introduced in Congress that would give \u201cqualifying\u201d households money to help pay for gasoline\u2026. \nLow-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act \u2013 Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to states to establish emergency assistance programs to pay eligible households for the purchase of gasoline. \nA hard working American family is also going to need health insurance. Well, we all know how expensive health insurance has become. In fact, health insurance costs have risen by 23 percent since Barack Obama became president. But let\u2019s assume that our hard working family has somehow been able to find an amazing deal where they only pay $500 a month for health insurance for a family of four. \nFor the government parasite, health insurance is not needed. If there is an emergency, the government parasite can just go get free medical care at any emergency room. \nAnd of course there is always Medicaid. Back in 1965, only one out of every 50 Americans was on Medicaid. Today, one out of every 6 Americans is on Medicaid, and things are about to get a whole lot worse. It is being projected that Obamacare will add 16 million more Americans to the Medicaid rolls. \nSo what about food? \nEveryone has to eat, right? \nWell, the hard working family in our example is faced with an environment where food prices are constantly rising but paychecks are not keeping up. Let\u2019s assume that the hard working family in our example clips coupons and cuts corners any way that it can and only spends about $50 for each member of the family on food and supplies each week. That comes to a total of $800 a month for the entire family. \nSo what about the government parasite? \nGovernment parasites need to eat too. \nWell, that is where food stamps come in. Right now, there are more than 46 million Americans on food stamps. Since Barack Obama became president, the number of Americans on food stamps has increased by 14 million. Food stamps have become so popular that rappers are even making rap videos about using food stamp cards. \nOkay, so after all of this where do we stand? \nWell, the average hard working family so far has spent $3500 out of the $4000 that they have to spend for the month. \nWe still need to find money for clothing, for paying off credit card debt, for paying off student loan debt, for dining out, for entertainment, for medications, for pets, for hobbies, for life insurance, for vacations, for car repairs and maintenance, for child care, for gifts and for retirement savings. \nBut wait. \nThere is actually no money left at all because we have forgotten one of the biggest expenses of all. \nTaxes. \nWhen you total up all federal, state and property taxes, our average hard working family is going to pay at least $1000 a month in taxes. \nSo that puts our average hard working family in the hole every single month. \nMeanwhile, the government parasite does not pay any taxes because he or she does not earn enough money to be taxed. \nAre you starting to get the picture? \nIn many ways, life can be so much easier when you are constantly taking from the government instead of constantly giving to the government. \nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie recently put it this way \u2026. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a bunch of people sitting on a couch waiting for their next government check\u201d \nOnce again, I am not dumping on those that have been through all kinds of nightmares because of this economy. As I have written about so frequently, the U.S. economy is simply not producing enough jobs for everyone anymore, and this is creating major problems. \nJust about everyone needs a helping hand at some point, and we should always be compassionate to those that are in need. \nHowever, there is also a growing number of Americans that are content to simply give up and live off of the government, and that is fundamentally wrong. \nIt is not the job of the U.S. government to take care of you from the cradle to the grave. What the U.S. government is supposed to do is to make sure that we have a well functioning economy that operates in an environment where hard working individuals and small businesses can thrive, and sadly the U.S. government has failed miserably in that regard. \nWe desperately need the U.S. economy to be fixed, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath waiting for that to happen. \nAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance and at some point the safety net is going to break. \nWhat is our country going to look like when that happens? The Shocking Truth About Unemployment In America In One Chart \u00bb David H \nPreach it Michael! I work in the finance industry and can\u2019t tell you how many applications I see where the single mother of 1-4 kids, in some cases, from different fathers is getting child support, afdc, wic, housing assistance and has a boyfriend or ex- husband living with them and making 2-5k a month. These people live better than most others because they are working the system with no one to tell them anything different! In addition to this issue we have another large issue of people bartering or being paid in cash avoiding taxation completely. We are all going to pay dearly for our arrogance, indifference, and ignorance! Rancher \nYou know what\u2026 there are and more often times I would rather burn my cash than send it into the govt to pay these bums sitting at home. We do every darn thing we can to keep it out of those leaches grasp\u2026. Prepared Pastor \nI briefly dated a woman with three children who I saw really gaming the system. Her subsidized townhouse apartment was nicer than my own home. Her utilities were based on her income and she made great dinners using food stamps. \nShe was in her last semester of college to earn a bachelor degree when I asked her what her plans were for after college. When she told me she was going for another degree so she could stay on the dole I broke up with her. \nI imagine she has a free cell phone now. Michael \nI would say that you sure dodged a bullet there Pastor. \nMichael Joel \nIf you want to have an idea of the sress it can create for workers just look toward Belgium (Europe). It\u2019s the country with the \u201cbest\u201d welfare system. From your birth to your death you are under government umbrella. Of course this come at a price : the active workforce pay for it. \nFor instance, did you know, an immigrant can receive money from the government (as a right to live decently) even without working. Then he can bring in his family if he was alone when he arrived (under the family reunion excuses), which in turn have some right also\u2026 The amount of money they can receive is between 900 \u2013 1200euros per month\u2026 all of that at the expense of the workforce. \nBy the way, the demographic pyramid his completely reversed. At first the Belgian welfare system was build around an era of full employment (50\u2019s and 60\u2019s), when the workforce was made up of young generations (babyboomers) and when everything has to be rebuild after the war. \nNow, the babyboomers at become the papyboomers and have a right for their retirment, etc, etc. Yet this system being based on the active workforce (made up of less young people and underqualified), it is meant to crash one day or another. \nTo see the USA going toward a European version of welfare system is a huge mistake destroying the foundation of your country. \nJo\u00ebl MisterD \nUnfortunately, I believe this has passed the point beyond return. The best anyone can hope for now is a miracle or get ready for the inevitable crash. I pray that nobody nor I will be forced in the middle of the mess such as having to literally protect oneself from crazy people, etc. Ashley B. \nFinally someone that is not afraid to say something about this! It sickens me to see people leeching off the system because it\u2019s easy money and food and of course free. \nI know of LOTS of people where I live that get food stamps, SSI, welfare etc. because it\u2019s free and they don\u2019t want to work (many of them are too lazy to take the trash out, seriously) \nYet me and the rest of my family earn a living, work hard and have to look at these bums drive nice cars, sit home all day and pump out paychecks, I mean kids. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, some people honestly need help and I often donate to the needy, but these are different from the pure lazy bums that just TAKE benefits because they\u2019re too lazy to work. Jodi \nI have to say I love the \u201cpump out paychecks, I mean kids\u201d. So true! I have a friend who is a retired nurse and she has seen a lot of young people in the hospital with child who had good intensions on going to college and getting a degree. Most of them go to school, get married and get pregnant before they even graduate. Without even thinking about starting a good life and financially being prepared, they get on medicaid & welfare because they don\u2019t have the money or a job to take care of their child. Sheepdog 1 \nI guarantee that the \u201cGovernment Parasites\u201d will pay\u2026 \n\u2026come Judgement Day. \nMeaning of course, they will never pay. Recoveryless Recovery \nGreat article, as usual! \nOne of the MAIN reasons why the American sheeple haven\u2019t REVOLTED yet is precisely thanks to all the government hand-out programs that currently exist. Indeed as you well said; many, many Americans actually plan their entire lifestyles around doing whatever it takes to continuously qualify for them. Unfortunately for the rest of us, as long as there\u2019s a dumpster behind a McDonald\u2019s that these SLOBS can dive into for free food, they will NEVER go hungry. And revolutions rewquire HUNGRY people. \nCheckmate. \nToday\u2019s America offers only TWO viable expectations for achieving actual \u201chope & change you can believe in\u00ae\u201d: one requires you to wield a passport & one-way ticket overseas, the other requires wielding an AK-47. \nI myself will go with Option A. Paul \nThe fostering of dependency on illegitimate governments installed through media fraud or outright election fraud (like you have in the US) is what it is really about. DAS \nI will give you an example of the the system is flawed. My father worked full time all his life. Paid all his taxes, S.S. and so forth. When the doctors found his canser, it was to late, he had only a short time to live. He worked intill the day he fell and could not walk. We (his family) supported him with his finaces as best we could. Going to the goverment only for help with food stamps. They gave him 14 dollars a month! W.T.F. can you buy with that. We shopped at discount stores, were many people used food stamps. I watched as these people got in to nice cars, with nice clothes with BAGS full of food. Mean while I hurried back to my 12 year old truck (so i wouldent be late for work) with a small bag a crap food. I guess I need to lean how to milk the system too. R.I.P. dad mondobeyondo \n$14.00 a month? GASP! The explanation that comes to mind is, the government must have been using employment and income data from 1912, not 2012. \nThe reality is, Uncle Sam is flat broke. He has too much pride to tell you he\u2019s broke. Bernadette \nThat is just sick, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. That is so ridiculous I don\u2019t even know what to say. GOD bless your poor dad, and you for having to go through that. I\u2019m so sorry:( Jodi \nIt\u2019s true, I\u2019ve known some people in my life that do as little at possible to get government assistance. Most of them seem very proud of it and believe they deserve it. My question is, what happens when government runs out of money and can\u2019t pay all these people who have been dependent for so long? That doesn\u2019t sound good! Nothing to see here, go back to sleep. Ron \nThink Greece WM \nJodi, Don\u2019t go back to sleep when the money runs out. It is inevitable that the borrowed money will stop coming and all therse free loaders who have no clue of what it\u2019s like to actually do something, will riot, protest, and burn the cities of America down. Consider this future event as a time of national cleansing, because the millions and millions of law abiding citizens who enjoy the 2nd Ammendment,and have worked for what they have, will surely bear arms to protect themselves from the entitlement zombies coming to take what they have\u2026 \nThere will be a population decrease and a cleansing of the entitlement crowd. \nBut, please do not sleep. This is a time to prepare and keep watch, things are going to get very interesting in this nation in the very near future. Jodi \nI will never go to sleep. It seems like the media ignores this stuff and treats people like it\u2019s time to go back to sleep. That is what I meant! 007 \nHave you ever watched a zombie movie. It will be a lot like that when the government checks stop. James \nThe poor and unemployed in the U.S. will never be able to get off of the government roles. We are experiencing what I like to call, \u201cReverse Industrial Revolution\u201d. The Industrial Revolution was a time when farmers were attracted to the big cities for jobs that paid high wages, when compared to their farm incomes. Now, we are experiencing high unemployment from jobs that will never come back unless the energy situation is somehow reversed. These unemployed people will soon realize that they have to have someway to get food to feed themselves. Especially if food stamps and government assistance starts to disappear, and it will. These unemployed people should begin to relocate out into rural areas to find homes where they can grow and produce their food, and sell the rest for income. There is a situation starting to appear in this country where going to college is not a good investment anymore. The only real need for college nowadays is for medicine, engineering, and law. You would be better off taking out a loan for a farm. or opening a small business rather than going to college. Farm and agrarian related jobs can make good money, especially if you own your business. If this reversal comes to fruition, the small rural towns will come back to life and support families and provide a reasonably good life. Tom \nThe only real need for college nowadays is for medicine, engineering, and law. \nMedicine and engineering- yes, but law? The LAST thing this country needs is another lawyer (sorry Michael)! MANY of the problems facing this country were caused but lawyers and the fear of law suits! Tom \nsorry again- by lawyers nowwthen \nGood points. If you can\u2019t find work with a useless bachelor\u2019s degree you will still be accountable for paying back your student loans even after going through bankruptcy. If, like you advise, you instead borrow money to buy a farm or start a business your hard work would benefit you and your family and not a corporation that views you as an expendable business expense. And if your business failed those loans could be reduced or eliminated through bankruptcy. Too many kids are brought up being told to study hard so they can grow up and find a good job. Parents should be telling them to study hard and learn how to run a business that involves doing what you\u2019re good at. S. Wiseman \n\u201cYou would be better off taking out a loan for a farm. or opening a small business rather than going to college. Farm and agrarian related jobs can make good money\u201d James, you are right on the money. I know many people who are doing just that \u2013 buying or leasing small acreage to grow crops (1 to 5 acres) and build cottage industries. They are sick and tired of being milk cows for the government leeches and are doing the right thing by starving the beast of what it needs. The major news networks will never report this trend but it is happening. The peaceful revolution has begun. Of course, the government may react with forced labor. Bernadette \nWow, those are really good ideas, and I agree with you on so many levels:) Why are you not running for President? We need someone at the Helm with a sharp mind, with creative ideas. Not the ideas of destruction coming from Washington. Everything you said made so much sence. Now I know what to pray about:) Cinderella Man \nAgreed going back to the basics of rural living will become a means to an end in the future. There is no hope in living in the superslum cities of tommorrow! ky survivor \nOne step closer to total control. That is what a welfare state is about. God help us. Josh \nI highly doubt that Jesus would use the term parasite to describe a fellow human being. DAS \nYour right. He would call them leaches Another Richard \nHow about \u201cvipers\u201d in Mathew 3:7? Jesus was not at all \u201cpolitically correct\u201d as we sweet Christians are Laodocian America are. Colin \n\u2026you have a better term? David H \nTrue\u2026.but he would say get off your rear end and work for your living if you are able. At least volunteer your time to some worthy cause to help justify the free lunch your on. I have a relative that draws SSDI (Social Security Disability) and volunteers he says he does it to help justify his disability payments he recieves. We need more people in the world like that. 007 \nHow about sluggardly leaches. If a man will not work let him not eat. Proverbs. Steve \nYour blog refers to those who feeding off of the nanny state. What about the millions of government(valueless)workers making 75 \u2013 150 K/year with all the perks and a rosy pension they can start to draw before they turn 60 (unless they double or triple dip). They\u2019re just as parasitic as the the free loader on the dole. Altogether, these parasites make up more than half of America\u2019s population. At this stage of the empires existence, I\u2019m saying to myself, let it all collapse. It\u2019s going to be hellish but the longer the government props up the dog poop with fiat money, the more chaotic it will be. Michael \nSteve: \nYes, you are right. I have written about the inflated compensation that government workers get in the past. \nMichael Klean \nAll systems are broken. There is no right anymore. Stop thinking there is a right way to do something. Going back to sleep is more interesting than earning a living. SpunkyBunks \nMy lazy obese sister is one of these parasites. We are all ashamed of her and she knows it. Her worthless husband doesn\u2019t even bother showing up around us anymore because he knows we think less of him as well. And they have five children, 3 of them are high school dropouts so far. Great welfare system we have in Amrica. It rewards these losers to sit around and breed more idiots too! Paul \nNice family. \nWhere have family values gone these days? \nWhy should the tax payer pay for YOUR family, if you do nothing but complain about them? \nWhat have YOU done to prevent your nieces and nephews dropping out of high school? Bernadette \nYour sister is so lucky to have such a supportive family to help her through her hard times. I\u2019ll just bet you all were that supportive of her during her whole life that\u2019s why she\u2019s been such a success. \nGood job mom and dad:D Mattyboy \nStart to hide your income. Make extra cash doing things (legal) that can be hidden. This has gone on for a long time in the EU. Taxes are close to 90% over there. I do not want to pay the Fed for a number of reasons. I wish we had a revolt of about 200 million that decided to not pay taxes. I guess we would only need 58 million. I like making cash that I do not have to claim. I would also support a flat tax and the abolition of the IRS. But, you can\u2019t trust the Gov. they always \u201cneed\u201d more money. Kathy Smith \nI totally agree MATTY I wish there was a way to get everyone to not pay taxes for 1 pay check & not buy gasoline for 1 day.That would get some attention. Paul M \nhttp://www.thoughtsfromaconservativemom.com/2012/02/number-of-americans-dependent-on-government-jumps-23-welfare-state-now-consumes-70-of-federal-budget/ mark \nI have been a landlord since 1981. I no longer manage the apartment complexes, but I have seen all that Michael writes about in the past. It make me sad to see where this country has gone. We used to be a proud nation that could do anything, but no longer is our population strong in heart. We have become a weak useless country of people that think everyone else owes them a living. tappedops \nFor the umpteenth time\u2026 dont get mad\u2013get even,\u2026 and if you cant get mad, its because youve been labotomized by the air food and the water\u2026 your programmed\u2026your under mind control\u2014 yea- laugh while you can.

DAS \nI would gladly be in the picture! sistrunkqueen \nI don\u2019t agree with this article. I think any American who has paid their taxes should be able to get any type of government assistance. I am a tax payer. I also an unemployed, but if I need some assistance you betcha I will apply. My dad, who is a Vietnam Vet, can qualify for food stamps but he say \u201cWe aren\u2019t that po\u2019!\u201d My mom wants him to get the aid. Anyway to help make ends meet should be explored. My sister has WIC. I need some government assistance. Where do I sign up? Oh by the way I got the free phone. It is great for local calling. McKinley Morganfield \n\u201d I am a tax payer. I also an unemployed\u2026\u201d \nError! Does not compute. Error! Review data and resubmit. Cinderella Man \nDude they take taxes out of unemployment checks\u2026 McKinley Morganfield \nYes, they take FICA out. But in the end isn\u2019t it really government playing a charade by simply giving them less? BTW, SS & medicare, which are supposed to be funded by FICA receipts, are both in the red. For every $1.00 DC spends, $0.40+ is borrowed money. Annual interest payments on the federal debt will soon be $500,000,000,000. Do you think this can continue another 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? Rancher \nExcuse while I barf\u2026. Rodster \nThere\u2019s a big difference. If someone is really down on their luck and needs help after doing all they could to get a job then I have no problem with what you just said. \nIf OTOH, someone wants to live of the Gubmint so they can stay home and play Call of Duty MW3 and watch TV then you sir might just be Gary2\u2019s brother. \ud83d\ude1b \nI was down on my luck several times. At one point all I had to my name was a months worth of rent. You know what I did? I took \u201c3\u201d minimum wahe jobs just to pay the bills. And I refused to ask the Gubmint for assistance. I figured once I did that it would be a point of no return. Mal R. \nshouldn\u2019t your name be WelfareQueen? Tatiana Covington \nVery well, let them starve to death and be done with it. \nThat will get rid of the unfit weaklings.

But I have a feeling it will end very very soon\u2026 \n\u201cKeep working there are millions on welfare depending on you!\u201d Already Gone \nThe economy is simply not producing enough jobs for everyone anymore and this is creating major problems. the problem with companies leaving this country started when obama took office and implemented his harsh environmental rules if the environment is such an issue then way did they not start implementing solar power,wind power,etc 20 or thirty yrs ago? the technology has always been there during WW2 germany was already making bio-fuel from potatoes and other vegtables,methanol gas from cow-shit my uncle told me back in the depression days they would create battery banks and hook up a generator to the windmill and charge the batteries to power the lites in the house at nite.As i had wrote before during Jesse Ventura\u2019s days as Gov of Mn they had what was called the greyhound-chicago pipeline where people from chicago would come up and use family/ relatives adresses/claim they were residents of Mn get there welfare check and go back to chicago one individual said at the time that he was going to retire in Mn becasuse it was so easy to get welfare-26 yrs old! At This Time the Democrat party is pounding the welfare drum again, they want to add more people to the welfare rolls in this state, who in the hell is going to pay for this? This state is already having money problems we do not need anymore.Since i have been told that i am confused let me relate a fact to you sharonj one reason george bush would not sign the kyoto treaty back when he was president was because of the irreversable damage it would do to the u.s economy now obama has done this in his own way and look at what has happened and mix that together with the ptb\u2019s desire to create a global economy somebody has to pay the price and it is obvious who it is. I Am Neither Democrat nor Republican as i do not care for either, old phart why don\u2019t you tell them to point the gun the other way? Some people in this country are stupid and lazy and need to get off there fat asses and quit stuffing there faces full of potato chips and get a education and a job, the truth hurts doesn\u2019t it. I Am tired of seeing more and more of my hard earned money going to deadbeats so they can live a nice easy life and not have one ounce of respect for the people that are making it happen for them. Gay Veteran \n\u201c\u2026the problem with companies leaving this country started when obama took office\u2026.\u201d \nThat is pure BS and you know it. I\u2019m no Obama fan but outsourcing did not start with him. McKinley Morganfield \nTo protect fools for the folly of their actions fills the world with fools. If you want more of something subsidize it. If you want less of something punish it. We, in the name of compassion, reward fools who have made bad choices. We subsidize those bad choices generation after generation. We punish frugality and hard work via regulations, taxes, and low interest rates. \nDemocracy is dangerous when it creates a class of citizens who benefit from the frugality and hard work of others. Robbing Peter to pay Paul only works until you run out of Peters to rob. I have compassion for those who are truly needy through no fault of their own, but leeches must be starved. Blood sucking ain\u2019t the way. mondobeyondo \nThe system seems to be geared toward rewarding the parasites. There are those out there who truly, honestly are in a hard-luck situation, and need a helping hand, so to speak. \nAnd then you have the parasites and leeches. Those who decide to make government dependence their career choice. The ladies (ahem \u2013 I use that term loosely) who are accustomed to pumping out a baby every couple of years so they can get better benefits. Food stamps, Aid to Dependent Children, WIC, child support (hope you had a \u201csugar daddy\u201d knock you up!) All coming their way in 9 months! And they didn\u2019t even have to move their bloated gluteus maximus (okay, obese donkey) off of the couch. Life is grand! \nGovernment assistance programs were not created so that these leeches can suck the lifeblood out of the hard working people. Another Richard \nGovernment assistance programs were created to make the Masses dependent upon the Gubmit. Roosevelt once said that \u201cnothing happens in Gubmit by accident\u201d. Gubmit undrestands human nature very well and how dependent humanity becomes on freebies and will cooperate with the gubmit to attack the honest hard working people who produce things and are the Real tax payers. When the producers of goods and services want the Freebies stopped by the gubmit, the leaches and parasite Masses will defend the Gubmit giveaways to the Death. Gubmit knows that. whens dinner? \nIt\u2019s a simple as this: \u201ceverybody wants to eat the corn, but nobody wants to plow the fields\u201d. Tom Lowe \nA lot of us don\u2019t mind plowing the fields! In fact we actually enjoy doing so. mondobeyondo \nI hope my federal income tax money (yes, I have to pay this year) doesn\u2019t go to helping those lazy pathetic sloths. But you know and I know that\u2019s exactly where it\u2019s going. \nNow I\u2019m starting to get angry. You won\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry. (Thanks, Incredible Hulk!) \nTo those intentionally taking advantage of the system: Someone is going to play Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire\u201d at your funeral. Just sayin\u2019\u2026. 007 \nThe most infuriating aspect of this welfare system is that it is unrealistic and unsustainable. The welfare state slowly but surely strangles the economy. The higher taxes and regulations and overbearing laws destroy the ability of businesses to survive. Inevitably, the unsustainable benefits will end just like they are ending in Greece. What will the parasites do when the freebies stop. They will starve like domesticated pets do or they will turn violent. Either way it will be a night mare similar to post apocalyptic zombie movie. It will be a pitiful life trying to avoid being eaten alive by these same parasites that are currently living off of the government tit. Tom Lowe \nI believe that is one reason why they have built \u2018Camp FEMA\u2019. 007 \nGreat article Michael. You certainly articulated the crisis which is slowly strangling the life out of the country. I read your article and feel I am able to look into the future and see how this nightmare ends. At least we can see it and prepare ourselves. I will share this article with everyone I can because it so clearly frames the fight for our countries ultimate survival. Michael \n007: \nThank you for sharing this article. The article may seem a little harsh, but the truth is that our society could use some \u201ctough love\u201d about now. \nMichael \nyou need to give the tough love to the real parasites\u2013corporate welfare Michael \nI think that you will find that I did that in the article I just posted. \nMichael 007 \nWhat a tremendous slap in the face to everyone who works and struggles every day to make a living and provide for their famalies. Pat \nLet me also add that: \n1. in Europe a garbage man makes as much income as a physician. Neither can be fired for incompetence. \n2.Income taxes in some places can be as high as 70%. And they have no deductions. \n3. The government is in direct competition with business. \n4. There is very little fishing or hunting. Pollution is rife. \n5. Few if any go to university. \n6. You must register where you live. \n7. Even your name change has to be approved by the courts if you want to use a name that is not on an approved list. \n8. And most of the people live in small flats often without bath tubs. \n9. In Spain we have no kitchen. In Denmark we had no shower or tub. \n10. All protests must be approved by the government. \nWelcome to your future. \n\u2026as it is so in many sectors of the U.S. education system. \nHow many schoolteachers are fired for incompetence? Not many, I suspect. \nTeachers teach the leaders of tomorrow. Our future teachers, teach future biologists, musicians, artists, plumbers, scientists, Web page designers, doctors, veterinarians, you name it. \nFor the job they do, most teachers are highly underpaid. The athletic coaches and deans are well compensated, of course. \nMaybe it is not so important to most of you. But try having garbage workers go on strike for a month. You will soon realize how essential they are. View from Abroad \n@1) How did you like your stay in Albania? \n@2) You seem to speak of some of the Scandinavian Countries (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway)\u2026but there the vast majority, even of those who are in the top-income-tax bracket, approve of it, because they see that they have a superior education system and an overall very efficient government and even welfare system. \n@3) Yes, right \u2013 government chooses to do e.g. waste management themselves, ecologically and recyclable to the max\u2026instead leaving it to the likes of \u201cBarone Sanitation\u201d (remember your \u201cSopranos\u201d, do you?). And you really think, YOU are better off in this matter???? \n@4) In most of rural Europe there is as much fishing and hunting as in rural US. Of course maybe not so much fishing e.g. in the Thames or the Rhine \u2013 so what? Go fishing in downstream Hudson River, and see what you catch. \n@5) Surprise: quite a LOT go to university \u2013 and WITHOUT burdening themselves with student loans for the rest of their lives, because it\u2019s mostly FREE (except for some \u201cElite\u201d institutions, where the only meaning of \u201cElite\u201d is \u201cRich\u201d). \n@6) Yes. So what??? \n@7) Yes\u2026there was a couple of immigrants in Cologne (Germany) a few years ago, who wanted to name their newborn son \u201cOsama bin Laden\u201d ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,212569,00.html ) \u2013 sorry, you are right, they were wrongfully turned down by our brutal, fascist, jackbooted Civil Servants. Horrible. \n@8+9) Well, YOU get what YOU can afford, even in Europe. But I have heard rumors that somewhere in Germany and even in France there are flats with a water closet(!!!)\u2026never seen one myself, poor me old European\u2026 \n@10) Oh, yes\u2026horrible. Luckily in the US you can rally any amount of people at any time you like \u2013 to let them get tasered down by the thugs you call \u201cPolice\u201d Gary2 \nStop speaking the truth you are ruining a lot of low information foolish republican conservatives world view. \nYou are 100% correct. \nLike I said before reality has a well known liberal bias. Marcus \nThat was eastern Europe 30 years ago\u2026 In Scandinavia we\u2019re doing quite well atm. I would say there\u2019s less welfare here than in the USA by now. And I pay 30% tax. For these 30% I get healthcare as well. I live in a nice house, I have a new car, I eat good and healthy food. Almost all services are private, even the ones financed by taxes. And I\u2019n not considered rich here. I\u2019m middle class. \nIn my opinion the middle class is actually growing here. And, by the way, my country does not have any oil. \nHave you ever been to Europe? Maybe Romania then\u2026 Idiot\u2026 Gwyn \nI am so sick of hearing how wonderful is to be living on Government hand-out. One I start working at 16. At the age of 50 my health and back went. I have done manual work all my life and now I can not stand for 5 min. before I need to sit. And for all that I live on $718. a month and get $50. on food stamps. And in the winter I may get 500. for winter heat. My house is $300 a month in cold of winter. They used to give $150. for cooling in summer but that end so they could help more people with winter needs. I do not own a car, could not afford repair it if broke down. So that mean friend who I pay gas money to or a cab if shopping or bus to go doctors. Also medicaid is no wonderfulness either I am grateful for it, but I have go to a clinic and wait for a month or six weeks for appointment or go emergency ward. Also my pills can be change any time state decide that they get better deal from another company. Not if it good for me or not. I am not living in one of those towers and paying 1/3 of income. I am lucky my family left part ownership of house to me. But I have property Tax to pay and house insurence and repairs and I do not get free phone or internet,I pay for it and the taxes that go with it. I do have to pay some money to doctor and pills but not lot I agree. But living like this means you are my entertainment. I bake my own bread and clean my house from chair. Also my clothes are second hand. Goodwill have lots of visit from people now days. I get sick of this idea that poor pay no taxes. What bill do get that does not some kind of tax on it. Anyone useing those same service have to pay them as well. Are they has much as yours? no. but they all so have less. Less to have fun on less to go out on and less to buy lots food with. Live on $50 see how far that take you. The rest comes for that monthly check I so lovely dream about every month sitting on my sofa. Till you be there you have no idea what like to live it. Not the pain I live with or problem that come with living. I look forward with fear as I watch the state and Federal government talks about things they need to cut so they can give people who live fancy house more money and want to vote for man for President who has bank account in places,like that Island and country with special banking laws. Make no mistake I know that cuts are coming but I am not going easy into that goodnight, so our million dollar congress men and women can keep there golden rewards. I know neither of the parties are our friends but I also know games have been play and working people money got rip off instead of yell for their heads so offend you worry about those who have less then you do. denny \nThe article itself betrays its own horse . If families had that many liabilities every month, they wouldn\u2019t be paying very much in taxes. The 1% have that part down though as most of them don\u2019t pay near as much relative to what a $50,000 wage earner pays. It\u2019s also suspicious that this article doesn\u2019t mention corporate welfare which usually receives twice as much as the social welfare recipients do and let\u2019s not forget what all those lobbyists are for. What\u2019s a Lockeed/Martin contract except glorified corporate welfare or the blackmailing which corporations pull on municipalities when they promise to build a factory in the environs ONLY if they are exempted from paying local taxes. Nah, this article is just more of the Republican AND Democrat crap of blaming those of us who have been hit the hardest for the consequences of the war which the wealthy have laid our lives, infrastructure and jobs to waste. Surprised to find it on this site. Tom Lowe \nThe article is quite clearly directed at professional freeloaders, and not at unemployed people. Jeremy \nWhile I disagree with much of Michael\u2019s predictions and assertions in his articles (because our nation has come from the brink many times before), he writes on elite welfare and wealth hoarding all the time. \nHe is fair. Leonard \nDear Michael \nIf you take away every single benefit of all these people, you will end up creating plenty of criminals on the streets who will end up in jail getting free food, free air conditioning, libraries, internet, and free health care for many many years to come. You mentioned an article some time ago how somebody checked himself into jail with some kind of a fake holdup in order to get health care in prison. Who do you think will end up paying for this? The banksters? The fat cats? The corporations? Good luck. Remember this: EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE! \nA job is a social program! Somebody has to give it to you when they hire you. When jobs are shipped overseas, then millions are out of work. If people are so happy with lay-offs, they end up paying for it one way or another! How many people are going to become successful like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs? Almost everybody? Good luck. Remember to play the lottery next time, anybody can win $200,000,000,! \nLet me give you a solution, Michael. Let\u2019s bring ALL the jobs back that have been outsourced over the last two decades. Is this going to happen? Of course not! Michael \nLeonard: \nYes, that is why I write about \u201cfree trade\u201d and our trade deficit over and over so that people can understand what is happening. \nMichael VyseLegendaire \n\u201cAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance and at some point the safety net is going to break. \nWhat is our country going to look like when that happens?\u201d \nEgypt. We will have chaos in major metropolitan areas around the nation. Or maybe we are so drug and entertainment-infused that we will simply throw up our hands and pull down our pants for big daddy government. \nOh, and did you forget to mention the amount of people taking subsidized anti-psyochotic medication? When people suddenly come off of their expensive drugs, let us hope their violent outbursts do not reach the level of other well known mass murders associated with coming off of these SSRIs, like Sgt. Bales in Afghanistan. curt \nYes insurance costs have gone up. Why? People are unemployed. Why? Why not, their example has been an industry whose greed is boundless. Lets not forget that if only the top couple of percent of income makers paid their share it could mean clean water, education and health for everyone on this planet. Certain parties have been trying to sink this system without coming up with an alternative and why in the world would anyone not greedy want privatization of natural resourses. Its industry that\u2019s ruining this country and the greed that is their legacy. stan \nAnd on top of that, race wars and riots are coming to a city near you. This from the Black Panther: \n\u201cIf you are having any doubts about getting suited, booted, and armed up for this race war that has never ended, let me tell you something\u2026 The thing that\u2019s about to happen to these honkies, these crackers, these pigs, these pink people, these mother \u2019 turtle people \u2013 it has been long overdue.\u201d \nIf you happen to be one of them honkies, or crackers, or pig, or pink people, or mother turtle people, you might just end up dead, for no reason other than your whiteness. Nexus789 \nAmazing number of self righteous pompous individuals. The US has never had welfare state. It is more like a dependency system that has evolved to placate the masses as the US economy has declined and people have adapted to \u2018game\u2019 the system. \nWhat do you expect will happen if millions of jobs and tens of thousands of factories have been closed down and off shored to China, India, etc. What are the millions of unemployed going to do. The payments, food stamps, etc, are ways of keeping the idle masses passive. \nAt some point this will end as the US is bankrupt and austerity measures will be introduced and many of these payments will be withdrawn..no food stamps, no unemployment benefits, no medical support, etc. Then you will all get you wish and reap the consequences. Paul \ndoes a common shareholder contribute to the success of a company? \nIsn\u2019t the shareholder the true parasite? \nHe draws money out of the company and does nothing in return? Paul \nDo you have any dependents? \nYes, shareholders, managers, chairmen, bureaucrats and politicians. Paul \nIn Hong Kong, \nevery citizen has the right to medical treatment in public hospitals (only entrance fee of USD10 to be paid). \nThere is no VAT in Hong Kong. 66% of Hong Kong people do not pay any income tax. Max. income tax is 15% of gross salary. Minimum is 2% \nThe Hong Kong government does not have debts. Last year they had so much money left over, they paid every Hong Kong citizen over 18 about USD600. In addition they gave every tax payer a tax rebate of USD600. \nWhat are they doing wrong? de Malfosse \nre: \u201cEver since the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d began our debt has exploded\u201d\u2026 certain amount of accuracy in writing this BUT the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d ran alongside that other horse in the Imperial race: the Viet Nam War, and the Viet Nam War is the direct source for Americans monetary difficulties today. \nI argue the debt explosion has much, much more to do with the maintenance of Uncle Sam\u2019s Empire, an Imperium where tremendous amounts of American taxes continue to flow outward, then it does with the neighbor on welfare. \nI suggest the \u201cwelfare bum\u201d is an easy & obvious target deliberately promoted by Uncle Sam so as to divert attention from the Empire and it\u2019s 70+ year history of perpetual conflict, war, and interfernece in the affairs of other nations. \nExample: Country XXX (so as not to offend anyone) has itself received an average of 5 millions a day for more than 60 years off the American taxpayers back. Now if that doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cgov\u2019t parasite\u201d, what or who does? \nIs your neighbor on welfare more damaging then an entire company, say Lockheed-Martin, which hasn\u2019t been off the gov\u2019t teat since Truman was president? Tom Lowe \nExcellent points although they are clearly not directly related to the topic. \nWhat I actually see on the ground here is me working night and day for $800/month after 6 years of college long ago while the completely able bodied guy over there who never bothered to go to school does nothing all month but smoke dope and gets $900. NeoIsolationist \nI work. My wife worked for a long time and is now on unemployment. She would be one of that 49 percent collecting government benefits. She doesn\u2019t want to be on unemployment, and intends to vote against the current administration come November. While lots of that 49 percent wants to continue scamming the system, I\u2019d say there\u2019s some in that group like my wife who don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think 49 percent in and of itself will be enough of a percentage. I could be wrong of course, but I recall hearing that Obama wanted to get about 75 percent of the population getting some kind of government assistance. I think he would agree that 49 percent, while alot, is not enough. Michael \n\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201dIn America today, we deeply penalize hard work and we greatly reward government dependence. \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d \nsame Thing in france, for a longtime As a disabled, i could have until $1000 from government as benefits \u2026. but, no support to get a job, and once i get my own business, many taxes and no more benefits because of my disability \nstupid world chris \nGreat article Michael as usual. But imo it\u2019s overlooking a critical component to this problem: the breakdown of the family structure. I know your fully aware of this but I just thought it could use some mention. It will be a cold day in hell before I or anyone in my family accept any sort of assistance from .gov. jazzage \nYou are missing three important areas of government dependance in this article. One, the liberal blue states pay more in federal taxes than they get back. That excess goes to the conservative red states that whine about the government but could not exist without their excess of government contracts, military bases, etc. The states of the old Confederacy get almost $2 back for every dollar they pay in. Two, the greatest amount of welfare in this country is money taken by taxing the middle class to subsidize the rich and big business. An example is the private prison industry. We privatize the prisons, the private companies that run these prisons then become lobbyists to bribe the \u201clawmakers\u201d to make more laws making more things illegal so they have more prisoners and more revenue. Three, people with kids have more deductions and pay less taxes to the point where they have essentially zero taxes. Who has the most kids? Mothers on welfare, yes, but also Republicans who get away with paying little or no taxes. Guess who makes up the difference? Those of us with fewer or no kids, generally more liberal people. We also pay full freight on property taxes that fund the public schools. \nThe hypocrisy of conservative morons is astounding. I say let\u2019s get rid of public funding of schools, end all corporate welfare in all its guises, and set the losers in the Southern states out on their own and watch the size of the federal budget plummet. Gary2 \nyou are 100% correct. Michael will never acknowledge that you speak the truth as he does not let facts get in his conservative leanings. \nHow about the welfare of churches and pastors houses, err mansions being tax free. I do not want to subsidize some rich paster of a megachurch. \nPOOR Michael\u2013what ever are you goiong to do when the real facts about welfare are pointed out?? The church is the biggest welfare scam of all. jazzage \nYou are right, I forgot about the Churches that pay no taxes but yet butt their way onto every political conversation and use the power of the Church to promote their idiotic ideas. \nWelfare for those on the bottom exists to prevent rioting in the streets, and welfare for those on the top is the reason the government exists. Gary2 \nits not just churches but pastors homes. Tax payers subsidize these mega church mansions as they are also tax free. Barn Cat \nThe new gold rush is trying to qualify for SSI by being considered legally disabled. Tom Lowe \nI sprained my ankle walking to a job interview. Can I qualify for SSI?!! Dave \nHello All. \nI have been reading this blog for some time, it is good to read some non-mass media propaganda. I however do not subscribe to the notion that USA or the rest of the world will descend into anarchy overnight. It will continue to be a gradual decline over the next 3-5 years, as it has been so far. \nIt is not merely policymakers to blame, but a system that only operates on perpetal growth fuelled by cheap energy. As this energy rises in not only monetary cost,but also energy input costs, economic contraction is inevitable. \nPeak oil is definitely here. Shale and tar sands proves they\u2019re getting desperate. \nOver time, perhaps people may need to return to the rural agrarian lifestyle they had pre-indutrial age,in order to survive. But the sun will stil rise and set. \nI don\u2019t think that anarchy will come either, at least not where I live. Just a slow decay of order. Whatever happens, I would rather die helping my fellow man, content with this life I\u2019ve been lucky to have, than to go down defending my \u201cstash\u201d. \nAs for all this Dec 2012 rubbish, FYI our calendar (gregorian) ends every 400 years. Funnily enough we\u2019re still around. Another Richard \nThe Powerz that be, hold the rip cord on this Gargantuan Unpayable Debt of the USA and Europe. When they are satisfied with the ever growing level of this Debt \u2013 They will pull the rip cord on the Trillions of $ of Derivatives By The End Of 2012. That is their timeline to commence the New World Oder, I mean Order. I believe we will All be startled and frightened by the Suddeness and the Severity of the Collapse. Jack the Leper \nThe United States Government is the parasite on the hard working people. Gary2 \nJournalist Chris Mooney discusses his new book, \u201cThe Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Reject Science \u2014 and Reality.\u201d \nIn his new book, The Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Reject Science \u2014 And Reality, science journalist Chris Mooney surveys this growing body of data and explains its significance. \nI think the authors mistake is assuming republicans have a brain to begin with. chuck \nIsn\u2019t the government our biggest parasite? Michael \nThe government feeds off of hard working Americans. It\u2019s their lifeblood. Chris \nHmm\u2026 although this won\u2019t be a popular thought, I really feel that the government should not hand out a dime to anyone for any reason. This was what the church was suppose to do. It was suppose to help those, widows, disabled, poor, etc. But, in our \u201canti-Christian\u201d society now, we\u2019ve given, or better stated, expect the government to take care of these and pushed the church out. The church still should be taking care of it\u2019s own though. No matter what kinds of rules the gov\u2019t tries to push. \nAs a side note, what really burns me is that all the so-called atheists, anti-Christians, etc would try to justify that Jesus would have wanted socialism and that the government should take care or it\u2019s people via handouts. That is a completely different Bible from what I read however as the Jesus I knew was very clear about people taking care of themselves and their family. If hardship hit, then the church \u2013 more specifically, other church members (others in your congregation) were suppose to then help you out. But, sadly, most \u201cchurch\u201d goers are now so self-absorbed and Bible deficent that they aren\u2019t willing to help other church members because they think the government should. \nUgh \u2013 catch 22. \nSorry \u2013 my ramble on to a great article that hit a nerve! Eric Ferguson \nThis article is an example of why America is going into massive debt. We have gone from a nation of makers to a nation of takers. People are content to sit on their but and receive enough money from the govt to live on. Yet it is people like me who go to work to support these lazy a$$ people. nowwthen \nThis is not the country I grew up in. As I\u2019ve said before I remember the days in the 60s and 70s when anyone with a high school diploma (and many without one) could find a job with a living wage. There were smokestacks and office buildings all over the country that needed workers. Most from my generation hate that things have devolved into the semi-socialist society Michael has painted here. The corporate lobbyists have convinced our country\u2019s leaders to buy into the belief that tossing U.S. workers into a world labor pool is somehow good for us. Tens of millions of jobs have been lost as a result. Add to that the technological unemployment caused by all of the robotic and computerized replacements for human labor and it\u2019s no wonder that unemployment and underemployment remain at record levels. A person who\u2019s exhausted his or her 99 weeks of unemployment after losing a job they held for 20 years is likely to reason that \u201cthe government caused my job to go away so the government must pay me for what they took from me.\u201d I guess it\u2019s what they refer to as a \u201cmoral hazard\u201d. I\u2019d like to think that most Americans would still prefer to work at a job that paid a decent wage rather than stay on the dole. But sadly that will not happen as long as good American jobs are being eliminated by lopsided \u201cfree trade\u201d policies and productivity gains resulting from more automation with less human labor. Jeremy \nYou think clearly and make good points. Winston Smith \nthough I can agree with your assesment of lack of jobs and good paying ones at that, the problem in part is the result of your statements-we have encouraged and trained people in this nation not to be their own bosses, but employees (wage slaves) dependant on others. Guilds- destroyed largely during the \u201creformation\u201d, which then ushered in a dog-eat-dog, selfish economy, highly individualistic. Said guilds then and could now, provide training, placement, apprenticeships and benefits (health, insurance,etc). During the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, the RCC laity had land associations in the USA and Britain-due to lackluster support of clergy, none from Protestants and a depression/WW II, those died on the vine. Their purpose? to train men how to famr and then, to buy/rent a farm to provide for themselves and others. Ditchling survived, in sorts, until 1989. The men might have gotten training, but nowhere to go and nothing to buy/use/rent afterwards. They then were continually unemployed and stuck in filthy cities. \nOr many has to rely on a lot of ready cash, equity and suck to buy a franchise. A lot more to get a loan from them or a whole lot more to buy their own buisness, plus where then is training? Open a bar/grill? great, would love to do that-do not know the first thing about payroll, taxes, with holding, how and where to order products,etc\u2026. pete \nYes. This is all true and accurate information. \nHere\u2019s some more: \nAfter 27 months of being unemployed, the jobs I am being offered are for about 1/4th of my former salary, while the costs for about everything are about twice as much. \nSo, my choices are get back to work and suck it up like a good sheople\u2026..or do my best to drive a spear into the beast\u2019s heart and try to kill it. More of a mercy killing actually. \nIt boils down to this. Do you buckle down, stiff upper lip, shoulder to the wheel and nose to the grindstone\u2026..or give up? \nI\u2019m going with the idea that supporting the crooked, decietful and errant policies is a loosing game and I am going to be merciful by helping put the ailing beast (US ECONOMY)to death. Right now it\u2019s a wounded and dangerous animal. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2026.if it was possible to nurse it back to health\u2026I\u2019d be on board. However, Bernanke and the politicoes have decided that injecting growth hormones and a diet of five hour energy drinks is practicing good medicine\u2026.so am I evil by wanting to see a suffering animal put to sleep? Tom Lowe \nThis happened to me 25 years ago and I swore then to kill the Beast and I know I am going to win. Tom Lowe \nBTW I got zip in unemployment from the Corporate Pigs. \nZIP \nyou got that right\u2013the jobs are low pay walmart crap. Jeremy \nYour anger is about where I was last July. But, you are still accountable to God for your actions, and He requires that you work and do your best (Apostle Paul: if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat). \nThe misery on this website will not help you either. I used to visit this site daily, but I realized that, while providing some key facts, it is no more knowledgable of the future than you or I. \nDon\u2019t give up. Many days are difficult, but trust me, you WILL find peace in the valley, on the other side. Now I am encouraging people who actually have good jobs. THAT is service, and is a blessing. \nI take the bar exam in July, and look at it more as an adventure to where God will take me. Gemtap \nTrack what they use\u2026.make them pay it back whent they get a real job\u2026if not debtors prison! Cinderella Man \nGood topic, Michael. Now I know why my Dad gets so infuriated around tax time. When I was out of work and unemployment expired, I worked in the \u201cunderground economy\u201d paid under the table because that was the only work there was. I breifly had to get SNAP assistance cause I had no other way to feed myself. Now that Im working again reading articles like this I often have to ask myself Why do I work? Tax time pisses me off too\u2026 I already told you about the welfare mama that got back $8,000 on EIC. She also gets section 8 housing assistance, and food stamps. So basically all you have to do is produce illegetimate children, apply for aid and presto! Set for life!! Keep working fools, millions on welfare depend on you! Michael \nAlmost everyone needs help at some point, but the key is to pick yourself back up and get off of the help and that is exactly what you did. \nI don\u2019t blame those that are going through temporary troubles. But those that have gotten comfortable living off of the system year after year and they never try to get off of it trouble me. \nMichael davidmpark \nNot exactly. \nI\u2019ve been on both sides of this lately, so here\u2019s how things really work. \nI worked as a government contractor until my wife became severely disabled about 5 years ago. So, I left to get a part-time merchandising job with a big box to be closer to her and our young kids. \nThat \u201csafety net\u201d where I live is not very big. \nLIHEAP\u2019s funding, at most, is about 2 months worth of utilities per year. The paperwork cost us about $30 to process and mail, after 4 hours of filling in and photocopying. \nMedicaid is very limited to kids and the disabled \u2013 I\u2019m not covered at all. Every 3 months I have to fill out a 15 page review and send in all related documents to prove everything that I claim. Most of the time, I\u2019m either missing a document or not enough info, so it lapses for about 10 \u2013 15 days. \nSocial Security \u2013 Disability has been a trial and half! We finally got full disability after 4 years, more than 1000 documents, and a law firm. For this, it\u2019s not much; about $1100 per month. And since there really isn\u2019t housing assistance from everyone else already on that program (been on the waiting list for 4 years), almost all goes to rent. \nOur kids do an online charter school (and doing well, they can actually read and do the math! The school district is an abysmal failure), but we can\u2019t qualify for discounted (not free) internet because we have to cut service for 3 months before we can apply. We can\u2019t do that unless we let the kids fall way behind. \nWe don\u2019t qualify for the cell phone discount (again, not free) cause I\u2019m still working part-time. I need to quit to get that one; but if I do, the wife looses medical coverage and a few others. \nIt\u2019s not a fun system: and I don\u2019t spend time waiting for a check \u2013 I spend a lot of time trying to build what we can afford to create our own utilities and grow food, looking for a better job to work-from-home because, as I said before, she is severely disabled and needs me here! I get up at 5 AM, got work \u2019till 11 (if I\u2019m lucky and she doesn\u2019t have a seizure or something \u2013 then I have to stay home all day), then clean house, help the kids with school, fill out paperwork, cook what I can, and then, if I\u2019m blessed, do some stuff in the workshop and then go to bed at 12 AM. \nThis is not a paradise; it\u2019s near to hell! I don\u2019t know who is profiting so much from being on these programs, but I know it ain\u2019t us! And from the experiences while working for the federal government, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the bureaucrats running the programs that are living the sweet life! Some of those guys make over $100,000 per year salary alone and spend most of their time in meetings. Tom Lowe \nYour case just illustrates how those who really do need help have such difficulty getting it in a system clogged with rank freeloaders. \nI know numerous fully able bodied mentally competent people who get SSI of $900 +/- or large Veteran mental disability payments up to $2500 and more who do NOTHING. Most of them are actually alcoholics or pill people. \nI knew a guy who gets $2500\u2013plus SS\u2013for some concocted mental disability (PTSD from a military helicopter accident? Come on, liar-actor! This was not even in combat). He came to me on the 11th of the month whining that he was already broke. Well he has lived in a van for the past 43 years while he freeloaded off of the phony PTSD disability. So he spent $2500 in 11 days living it up to the tune of $225+ per day and shows up broke and whining on the 11th here where we self sufficient people have had way more than our share of dumpster meals just to keep this roof over our head. \nI sent him to Camp FEMA, so to speak. \nI often have to work for myself for as little as $1-$2 per hour, and have for many years now. All you out there who think there is some sort of automatic minimum wage had better realize there is no such thing if you intend to survive. davidmpark \nThanks Tom mondobeyondo \nAll one needs to do to see government efficiency at its best, is to go to the local Department of Motor Vehicles office to get your vehicle registered. There are 30 counters available. Two employees, at two counters, are assisting customers. Some 600 or so people sitting, staring at screens, or chasing their kids. Already a bad sign. \nPress the little green button on the machine near the entrance. Your ticket reads \u201cnumber 863\u2033. \nThe loudspeakers announce, \u201cNow serving number 108\u2033. \nCome on \u2013 even the Post Office is better than this! Gary2 \nthere are only 2 employees at the DMV because right wing gov like the soon to be replaced walker cut cut cut. \nStop voting repube. Diane C \nIt is really people like you who do need the help, and are not able to get enough. The problem is the entire system (government) is broke. There are those who really take advantage, and there are those who really need it. You would think because the government is so big and bloated, they would have enough people to check on these things. However you would have to be efficient in order to do that. Our government certainly is not. \nI wish you and your family the best. davidmpark davidmpark \nOkay, I need to clarify some things. \nMy wife has an actual disability: severe traumatic brain injury, that caused epilepsy and a few other things. She was in a coma for almost a year and had to relearn most everything. It will cost her her life. It\u2019s real \u2013 not easy to fake those CT scans and the other numerous tests. \nSecond, I don\u2019t know how to game this system: I give \u2019em all the requested info, they tell me what we can get. Honesty doesn\u2019t pay off with these guys: and that\u2019s the point! \nWe HATE being on these programs! Using that EBT card in public is the most embarrassing thing; and the stares the cashier gives me is just damning. I hide the card best I can when swiping it and then quickly stash the eyesore away. When the receptionist at the doc\u2019s office asks about insurance, I always whisper the answer. \nIf these gov people want to do something right and good (for once); then pass a law that voids zoning laws for families that have a legitimately disabled member. I am capable of rearing animals and producing things here, but am limited because these guys want us on castrating programs that serve themselves! \nWe have food storage, but it\u2019s pretty basic now. And as someone here mentioned: if we don\u2019t have these programs, they\u2019ll take the kids and force my wife into assisted living \u2013 a kind of partial divorce. \nThis isn\u2019t the society I wanted; this is where I\u2019m stuck! Phillip Sherwood \nThe people I personally know who \u201cwork the system\u201d aren\u2019t getting rich but just treading water since they double up with family members and work low wage jobs. If they didn\u2019t \u201cwork the system\u201d they wouldn\u2019t have enough to eat or their children wouldn\u2019t be able to access health care. Many are caught up in drug abuse or alcoholism and are hardly able to maintain themselves. Some work very hard at low wage jobs and some don\u2019t work at all. I agree at one level that throwing money at these people is worthless but cutting them off is just as bad since the children are the ones who suffer. I remember at the church I grew up in that what worked wasn\u2019t monetary policy but individual assistance and genuine caring. Our pastor went to great lengths to assist a member who had a mentally ill mother and neither the pastor nor the church got a thing out of it except the right thing was done and people knew that this man and this congregation cared. My youth pastor said \u201cam I my brothers keeper?\u201d I thought he was referring to the specific scripture and I fumbled the answer but the Bible is clear from cover to cover what the answer is. Tom Lowe \nYou missed the whole point of the article. It states that there are too many freeloaders burdening a well-intentioned system designed for the truly needy. It never says or even implies that needy people should not get help. What it says is that people who AREN\u2019T needy are robbing the system. Stan522 \nI agree with you. Government sustenance programs are over burdened. However, over burdening is inevitable. Since government defines \u201csuccess\u201d only when they can increase their budget, and/or getting as many people reliant on it, you will always grow a program of free-loaders. By definition, this will always happen. \nNow, we have politicians openly feeding people with guilt for not putting up with supporting these ridiculous programs. They equate charitable \u201cgiving\u201d of your money to private support programs to you supporting government taking your money and creating a program. They are not the same thing. Government will ALWAYS be more inefficient. Gary2 \nam I my brothers keeper \nThat passage is not in Michaels and the other \u201cChristians\u201d on this site. Stan522 \nGubamint programs are not supposed to make you rich. They are intended to keep you captive into a low level of sustenance where politicians can get you to keep voting for them as they play the system and put you into a voting block that will ensure their continued candidacy. That goes for ANY program: \nHome Mortgage Interest Deduction Hope or Lifetime Learning Tax Credit Student Loans Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit Earned Income Tax Credit Food Stamps (did I miss any\u2013?) \nNone of these will provide people with what they need. All they will do is get you hooked just like a crack addict. Tell you friend to break away from government handouts and find their own way to success. It\u2019s inside of every single one of us. It\u2019s God given and we just need to unleash it. Stan522 \nI believe we are at that point where there may be more takers than givers in our society. The politician\u2019s are now so open about how if you vote for them, they will give \u201cyou\u201d free stuff. This \u201csafety net\u201d and how politicians have leveraged it into voting blocks has destroyed our country. Their political greed (power and money) has enticed the weak to become weaker by accepting these bribes. It\u2019s immoral and should be illegal to destroy the drive for success, self-reliance, and determination out of American\u2019s. Michelle \nYou have no idea just how much that hit home. God bless you jox \nVery unfair and disappointing article! You talk about a pitiful state of things in America, and suddenly, without justification, you equates it with a \u201cEuropean-style socialist welfare\u201d that destroys your nation \u201csocially and financially\u201d. Even worse, you end with that picture, which has NOTHING to do with the content of the article. \nIf you don\u2019t like socialism, OK, let\u2019s discuss it with arguments. But this method of picking something that you don\u2019t like and associate it somehow with the socialism is very unfair and not appropriate for your otherwise brilliant articles. It is exactly the same as when the far left blames any problem in the world on America and capitalism. \nAnd, by the way, let me inform you that some of the more \u201csocially and economically\u201d advanced and prosperous countries in the world are European and socialists (or social-democrats, if this word exists in English). You are going to have a hard time finding arguments against the ethics and politics of those countries, which are a model for everybody. Tom Lowe \nEveryone but Europe knows that Europe are the biggest freeloaders in the entire world. \nThe biggest. Tom Lowe \nIn fact, Europe is nothing but a whole subcontinent wholly dedicated to freeloading off of the rest of the world, and has been for centuries now. Gary2 \nMichael is becoming an idological right wing warrior where facts are whatever he hears on fox. He can no longer think for him self. This crap was probably transcribed from rush pill head bimbo show. DownWithLibs \nI see you have even more screws loose than you did before. So sad\u2026we pity you!!!! knightowl77 \nWell they are not a model that I would like to emulate. We\u2019ll see where they are in 3 to 5 years, but I do not ever think I will support Gov\u2019ts taking from one group to provide to another\u2026. \nThat is not the role of any gov\u2019t that I would care to be subject to\u2026.you can keep it\u2026 Barn Cat \nA lot of government jobs are necessary jobs. A lot of those people are incredibly arrogant. They think they\u2019re God because they work for the government. I saw that when I worked for the Census and my superiors had to deal with people who worked for the Department of Commerce. But those people are nothing compared to God. Bobby \nthe line at 2:14 applies here\u2026 Bernadette \nEvery time I read something like this it makes my blood boil. It\u2019s this mindset which is making me fight tooth and nail to get my SSI which I worked most of my life paying into. I\u2019m dissabled now. I have a list of illnesses longer than my left arm, and SSI has denied me and now I have to try to find a way to drive 200 miles away to go to some court hearing. You people seem to think it\u2019s so easy to get gov help when you need it. It\u2019s NOT! I\u2019ve been trying to get my SSI benefits since 2009 when I finally became too sick to work. I worked for years with my illnesses, but they got too bad for me to manage in 2009 and I just couldn\u2019t do it any more. Bernadette \nBTW I would much rather be able to get up and go to work everyday like I used to. I miss working, it\u2019s ridiculous to think that people who were created to create and work would rather sit and be sick, just so that they could get a few hundred dollars every month for free. Talk about socialism, that was Hitler\u2019s mind set \u201cLet the strong survive and the weak go to the wall\u201d That\u2019s why I can\u2019t believe there are so many Believers who are against public assistance. The Church is supposed to take care of sick people like me, not the gov. The Church isn\u2019t supposed to be robbing old ladies of their SS, there supposed to be caring for them. And Christians certainly shouldn\u2019t be complaining about services to assist sick and old people. Oh well it will all come out of the wash when JESUS gets back. Even so Please come quickly Lord JESUS. Cinderella Man \nBernadette, I woundnt be mad at you for getting SSI its perfectly healthy young teenagers and 20 somethings that say they have \u201cdepression\u201d or \u201cbi-polar\u201d and get to sit around and goof off all day while the rest of us foot the bill. BTW the reason that most people are depressed is because your govt. is tyrranical and you are materialistic!! Tom Lowe \nEXACTLY!! \nAnd then there are all the phony 420 patients, PTSD phantoms, pain pill puppies, and more! Gary2 \nmost 90% Christians are hypoctrites to the max. All one need do is read this site for proof of that. Stan522 \nThey will be left behind\u2026\u2026.. Another Richard \nNo, you are wrong. All 90% Christians are hypocrites. Only 100% Christians are Truely Christian. Another news flash for you buster \u2013 Only God can see the heart of any person and He alone Knows the True from the Hypocrite. So, quit wasting your energy trying to pick who is and who isn\u2019t a True Christian,because it is useless. Examine your own life and relationship to God is the best thing you could do for yourself and others. Ozmo \nThank you so much for that post. It would do well for everyone to live by this. Just my 2 cents Stan522 \nIsn\u2019t that just like government\u2026. create programs with big promises, make it near impossible to attain, move the goal posts mid game (extending the qualifying years out farther and farther), then steal from it, bankrupt it and then pander to the voting block of retirees and near retirees to garner more votes for the ones who bastardized it in the first place. \nOur problem is \u201cwe\u201d keep believing these SOB\u2019s every time they speak. Be wary of ANY politician coming up with a gubamint program that takes care of \u201cus\u201d. Besides, there isn\u2019t enough to live on once you get it. I would have rather kept my own money for the 40+ years (and still going) instead of giving it to the ripoff artists. \nMy beef is not with you who worked their whole life and believed the promises of politicians. My issue is with bastard (redundant) politicians that make false promises and then leverage votes promising more free \u201cstuff\u201d. They all can go straight to hell\u2026\u2026 mondobeyondo \nRemember that scene in the movie \u201cTitanic\u201d, where Jack asks Rose to hold onto her hand as the ship sinks? \n\u201cYou jump, I jump!\u201d No, wrong scene! It\u2019s the scene where the ship is taking the final plunge to the bottom. The undertow would have sucked anyone near the ship under water. \nThe USA is the Titanic. The people abusing the system, depend on the U.S. government for their survival. They will be dragged underwater. (Some of them already are. \u201cUnderwater mortgages\u201d.. wink, wink!) And they will suck everyone else under along with them. Chris \nIn the pyramid of wealth that could describe the population you would have parasites at the very top and at the bottom. At the very top the 1% also live a parasitic existence. I mean people like bankers/ CEOs and others who produce nothing and get rich by scamming those below and basically living a parasitic existence on those that actually do work, the middle of the pyramid. Under the middle there is a large population of an underclass some of whom are genuine hardworking people and some who game the system. The middle supports the lower and the upper parts of the pyramid. A host can only support a certain amount of its energy going to a parasite living on it. Too much energy lost and too many parasites and the host will be killed. This stage must be getting close. Those at the top with their corruption and fraud and greed set the example for those below to follow. When faced with corruption at the top and indolence below the middle will lose heart, see it\u2019s supporting a unjust system and may give up. CitizenS \nBeen a Paramedic for 21 years now and I have continually see things worsening. People used to call for EMS when they or a loved one was sick, now it seems we\u2019re just a \u2018free\u2019 taxi service. Sadly they don\u2019t realize or care that while they are being hauled around someone may actually need our service. And even though they aren\u2019t paying foir it\u2026\u2026.. I AM!!! I\u2019m all about giving a people a hand up, but I\u2019m getting tired of a third of my pay going to buy them cell phone minutes and the like. I built my own house payday to payday and I own the land. My family and I are putting up feeder pigs and a calf and just broke the sod on 2 acres of ground for a garden. We have wind power when there\u2019s a breeze and 3 underground springs on site. By all means let it collapse. Then these parasites will be forced to work!! Again Michael, good article. Michael \nThey use you for a free taxi service? \nThat is just sad. \nMichael CitizenS \nIn this state (WV) an individual can activate EMS, not give a reason, and state which hospital they want to go to and we have to take them. They do not even have to give us there name if they so choose. We call it a \u2018you call we haul\u2019. And on top of that many use the non emergency ambulances because they don\u2019t want to spend the money on gas or the bus to go to Dr. Visits and other non urgent medicals. I love my state and only wish that we and other states would reform our system. That by itself could save countless money and lives\u2026.. the optimist \nOh Yay for you. Don\u2019t you get it \u2014 you built your house paycheck to paycheck \u2014 there are millions of us out here who don\u2019t have the paycheck! And we don\u2019t because of the CEO parasites and 1% parasites who are all about churning and grabbing money over jobs. Outsourcing, golden parachutes, whatever, the jobs are gone and they aren\u2019t coming back. \nDon\u2019t be so grossly smug and superior. I just lost my house, which was my prepping homestead. I did all those homesteading things for years too, but without a good source of income, when my business failed 2 years ago, I lost it. DON\u2019T think for a SINGLE SECOND that you are invulnerable and incapable of losing YOUR paycheck \u2014 YOU CAN LOSE IT ALL. \nThen maybe you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of reality. \n\u201cThen these parasites will be forced to work!!\u201d \nHateful. Don\u2019t you think \u201cwe\u201d WANT to have jobs?? FOOL, hateful fool. Please read Karol\u2019s comment below. The real parasites are at the top, in DC and in corporate boardrooms. CitizenS \nIf smug and being a fool means harsh austerity @ home (eating ramen, bologna sandwiches, working by myself til 3 in the morning on my house then getting up to be @ work @ 0800 (in which I couldn\u2019t even claim the $8000 tax credit because I didn\u2019t borrow from the banksters), and scratching odd jobs on days off) is smug then I guess that shoe fits. Did I work the system? No. Do I live in the lap of luxury? No. Have I gone without to provide a roof and food for my family? Yes. Am I prepared for what is coming? I hope so. I feel for anyone that looses their job, I really do, I\u2019ve been there before. My comment was not meant to be condescending towards anyone. But I will say this and its as timeless today as it ever has been\u2026\u2026. Judge only a man after you have traveled in his footsteps. libertyin413 \nIn the interest of not repeating what others have said, I would just like to add that I don\u2019t believe that we should have any of these government \u201cbenefits\u201d or \u201csafety nets\u201d at all. The only thing the government can to is tax (read:steal) from producers and assist (read:redistribute) others. And it\u2019s not just the \u201cpoor\u201d receiving benefits/entitlement [sic], the connected elite get their welfare too. Government setting up these safety nets only exacerbates any problem that may have existed because now prices skyrocket as providers know any increase will be backed by the full faith and credit of the US Tax Payer; this hurts the very people the program was intended to help in the first place. All assistance should be done by private local charity as it was before. This way it is truly just a temporary helping hand when someone hits hard times and the organization/church can monitor for fraud. For the Progressives who claim this doesn\u2019t work, we never read about having to step over alternating piles of child prostitutes and dying old people in the street as you tried to make your way to your sweatshop job. The standard of living was increasing like history has never seen before when people were allowed to keep the fruits of their own labor (a one income household could support 5-6 people, children were being better educated, new cars & appliances, etc\u2026). Now under the Progressive model the standard of living is decreasing drastically as once again everyone has to contribute to the household income and the need to hop on the safety net has reached unprecedented levels. Lastly, even if the producers are lucky enough to retain some of their earnings and try to defer some of it for later consumption, they are hit again with the hidden tax of inflation that destroys their wealth and actually decreases their purchasing power. All of this made possible through the criminal and malevolent actions of the Federal Reserve. Karol \nHi Michael, Thank you for writing such honest and informative articles. I no longer watch the news or read the local papers because it is mostly all rubbish. Your website is fascinating and I have recommended your site to all my friends and family. No body likes a lazy cheat who games the system for a living, but I am fed up with the parasitical Wall Street Fat Cats, the Politicians, the criminals in D.C. And the 1%, who having been gaming the system for decades at our expense. These rich crooks have stolen billions from the American people, far more than the food stamp family ever will in a life time. BofA paid no federal tax in 2010 and got a billion dollar rebate as well, and I read that they paid no federal tax in 2011 either. When companies that make billions of dollars and give out millions of dollars in bonuses every year don\u2019t pay federal or state tax then the tax payer is robbed. On a local level police and fire stations are affected, schools too. Bridges and roads aren\u2019t being repaired. These parasites send their children to the best schools, they vacation all over the world, own multiple homes with tennis courts and pools, multiple cars and jets, they get to eat the best food, probably cooked by the in-house chef, they have housekeepers and nannies, they have the best health care money can buy, I could go on and on. Disney, a multi-billionaire company, got welfare for a fireworks display and multi-millionaire Sam Donaldson got welfare for mohair. Really! Our schools suck, minimum wage adjusted to inflation should be $22.50 an hour, people are getting screwed out of time-and-a-half, over-time, vacation time, their pensions, health care, etc. And if you work you are lucky if you can get 20 hours a week! Wage theft is the best way for the 1% to steal from the 99%. Most people are so Ignorant they don\u2019t even realize they are being robbed. I worked for the 1% in a private club in Boston, they docked my paycheck for 3 weeks of work. I am a poor single mother, and the richest people felt the need to steal 3 weeks of my wages. Wow! I couldn\u2019t afford to work for free so I had to quit. Do I begrudge the obese, lazy, and unmotivated for scamming the system? Not really. Especially since there ain\u2019t a Benz or a Jag in their driveway, no lawn service for their patch of grass, or a maid to clean up after their sub-par, high-fructose, hydrogenated, sodium laced, junk food dinners, and if they get fuel assistance to keep warm while eating their food-stamp dinner and watching Judge Judy, then good for them. Michael \nKarol: \nYes, I have written many articles about the corruption of the banksters and the elite as well. \nI am definitely not on their side. \nMichael Mr. G \nYou are largely right, Karol. Many people who are not doing well would do far better if they were dishonest. \nThat\u2019s what bothers me about the US today \u2013 no real earned privilege, just lots and lots of unearned, unfair big cash going to some fat-cats who are RUINING THE COUNTRY at the same time they are getting all that money! I mean, they could at least do a good job for all that cash. I don\u2019t think they even try, really. \nGood luck!

Corey Lewis \nWOW! What a great article! Loved it! My ex-wife has been one of these friggin parasites for 15 years and doing her best to raise my kids in that lifestyle\u2026over my dead and rotting body I say. People who have never worked hard or refuse to work hard do not deserve to have residency in this country. Put them all on a boat and ship them off. I\u2019ll even pilot the boat. Rick \nI know of at least one parasite in particular that lived off my older sister for many years. After she finally divorced the leach, he\u2019s now on government subsistence. These type of people all have one thing in common; they just are not employable. Stan522 \n\u2026..and the rest of them have government jobs\u2026. have you ever been to the DMV\u2013?

Mike S. \nWhen a person loses their job the first thing you do is apply for unemployment. After that runs out and your savings run out and your food runs out and you have kids. Do you honestly think the government will let you live off dehydrated food that is on the shelf in the basement? You will be on foodstamps and medicaid or they WILL take your kids! If you can\u2019t show proof of income, regardless of my house paid for and enough money(at the time)to pay my bills for another year. The first time you take you kids to E.R. for something it opens up a whole crap of worms if you don\u2019t have insurence. Just for stitches from a bike accident I now have my kids on Medicaid and foodstamps. I try to be positive about the government waste and use all they give on foodstamps to restock my shelves for the next go around. I will be pleased to answer any questions about my situation, even negative ones. I get on this site daily and this is my first comment. Michael \nYou make some very good points there. \nMichael Tom Lowe \nYou are not the person we are talking about. We are talking about lots of fully able bodied people who not only scam for all the gummint benefits but who also work in the underground economy year in and year out. tex \nYeah you hypocrites are always talking about some other person- not the person in front of you who has real need. \nYes there are abusers- but in my experience most people would rather work for their money walking to work over broken glass than jump through all of the hoops the bureaucracy demands for their meager pittance. \nThe fact is that the US economy is in the toilet and the sheeple are going to let Romney flush it. There are not enough jobs, not even in the cash economy. $6 to $10 an hour jobs won\u2019t pay the rent and feed a man\u2019s kids. \nWhen there is no alternative, people will work the government system to eat or they will turn to crime or justice in the streets- and there are not enough guns in this country to turn that tide once it starts. \nI think it is time quit with the rhetoric and get real- or it is all going to end very badly for us all. mondobeyondo \nI forgot about the kids aspect of the situation (I do not have children). \nWhoa\u2026 talk about growing up fast! Children in these dire situations don\u2019t need to ask what a \u201cbudget\u201d is. erheault \nAs we wander down the road to total automation in our industrys the need for middle and lower semi skilled labor will dwindle and the unemployed and the unable to work will multiply we will face a revolt as all other nation in the past and present have or now undergoing, How this will work out is unknown but it will happen to us, it dont matter who is president or in congress. no nation or country in history has survived by devaluing their monies or massive unemployment which is where we are heading, Enjot the ride as it will be historic to say the least. Bryan \nit\u2019s simple people our nation has gotten so far from God that we are reaping what we are sowing it\u2019s only a matter of time before the Lord Jesus Christ returns the mark of the beast is coming! don\u2019t be here for it after seeing how the U.S.A has mare debt than most of the european countries alone and look what is happening to them only a matter of time\u2026how much only The Lord knows wheter you believe or not it is amazing to see prophecy being fullfilled right in front of our eyes who will fix this huge world financial mess!!! read revelations chapter 13 turn your hearts to God while will still live in this age of grace! monk \nCut down on spending.

There is almost nothing but professional freeloaders for as far as the eye can see from here. I could tell all of you stories about freeloaders that would make your blood boil right off. My only hope is that the gummint finally stops issuing the by-now absurd freeloader checks and benefits and sends all of the professional freeloaders to Camp FEMA, right next to the bankster criminals and right where they all belong until they get off their dead butts and start doing something for themselves. And I don\u2019t mean maybe! Cinderella Man \nMy goodness man!! You need to bulk up on protien powders and high fructose corn syrup immedietly!! 105?? Thats skinny!! no offense. Tom Lowe \nIt\u2019s scary. I\u2019m surrounded by a sea of human sinkers. That means I have to do everything for myself and half of what they need done for themselves. There\u2019s just not enough time or money to eat well enough\u2013especially after all the coffee, cigs, feeding several spoilt cats, and whatever else I might decide to indulge in, like several hours of reading blog comments. \nOK\u2013so ya caught me! !!!! Eva \nYup, it\u2019s not a good time for jobs or growth or prosperity and it won\u2019t be until we get rid of the man in the Oval Office and replace him with someone who takes creating a business-friendly environment seriously. And returning Congress to baseline budgeting. They haven\u2019t been since the 1974 Budget Reform Act, which adds 10% annually to each federal budget regardless of necessity and I hardly need add regardless of federal revenue. sharonsj \nArticles like this piss me off. Right-wingers like to blame anybody who is struggling to survive\u2013but they never attack corporate welfare. \nExxonMobil earned $5 billion a year for the past four years and not only paid no tax but got a tax refund! Corporations get away with murder and rob us blind, but their execs are not in prison, are they? But let some guy steal food from a grocer cause he can\u2019t afford to buy meat and he lands in jail. \nI don\u2019t know why I remain amazed at the stupidity of the American public to swallow Republican talking points, but I am. If you folks don\u2019t learn how to look up facts on your computers, instead of being yes men, you\u2019ll help the Repubs steal what\u2019s left of the country. Michael \nI have written quite a bit about the corporations that pay no taxes and about all of the corporate welfare that takes place. \nMichael Gary2 \n100 articles on the poor to 1 on the corporate welfare. Come on Michael\u2013I see through your bs. Michael \nGary you know that I hit Goldman Sachs far harder than I hit the poor. \nMichael Gary2 \nI said corporate welfare not just goldman sucks. and no you bash the poor way more than the corporate welfare which is a FAR bigger cost. sharonsj \nEconomist Richard Wolff pointed out that over the last 30 years, corporations (along with government) have rigged the system so that they now pay only 25 cents in taxes for each $1 of tax paid by the average citizen. He also said that if people understood how they were being screwed we\u2019d have a second American revolution. Michael \nYes, I discussed corporate taxation quite a bit in the article I just posted. \nMichael Winston Smith \nTrue, but that never seems to upset \u201cconservatives\u201d, who benefit a lot from Big Govt/Big Biz.Their answer? Just lower taxes (but not spending) and \u201cget the Govt out of the way\u201d. El Pollo de Oro \n\u201cI call them GC\u2019s three Gs: guns, gold and a getaway plan.\u201d\u2014Gerald Celente \nMichael T. Snyder write: \u201cAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance, and at some point, the safety net is going to break.\u201d Yes, and when it does break, God help The Banana Republic of America (formerly the USA). That\u2019s when things are going to get really nasty in this Third World nightmare. I\u2019ve often said that when the going gets tough, the desperate do desperate things. They rob, they steal, they sell drugs, they mug, they carjack, they kidnap. They do all the things that make it so dangerous to live in Caracas, Ciudad Juarez, Port Moresby, Guatemala City, Kingston and a long list of other Third World cities with high rates of violent crime. They collect the dreaded Desperate People Doing Desperate Things Tax (DPDDTT), which is what the wealthy minority end up paying when they\u2019re surrounded by a dirt-poor majority. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think people realize just how evil and what an abomination our country has become.\u201d\u2014Alex Jones \n\u201cAmerica\u2019s not the same place it used to be. And when you look at the decline going on in this country, how anybody can believe that the dollar is going to be a reserve currency is beyond me.\u201d\u2014Gerald Celente \nNot all Third World countries are ultra-dangerous. I\u2019ve visited Morocco, which has a lot of poverty but doesn\u2019t have a lot of violent crime (only a lot of touts trying to sell you a carpet that you don\u2019t need). But I definitely see the BRA moving in the direction of the really violent and dangerous Third World countries, where kidnappings are a way of life and the cops are often in cahoots with the thugs. So if you think Baltimore, Detroit, Philadelphia and St. Louis are bad now, just wait\u2014the worst is yet to come. And rural places aren\u2019t necessarily going to be all that safe either when the you-know-what hits the fan (some small towns in Mexico are extremely dangerous). \nOf course, smart preppers understand all these things. They\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve been listening to Alex Jones, Gerald Celente, Paul Craig Roberts, Gary Johnson and Ron Paul and realize that those guys aren\u2019t alarmists\u2014they\u2019re telling it like it is, and the truth ain\u2019t pretty. \nIf you have a gun, I recommend keeping it in a safe, secure place and knowing how to use it. That gun will come in handy when the DPDDTT collectors come a knockin\u2019 here in The Banana Republic of America. William \nThe real government \u201cparasites\u201d are actually 90% of all federal workers (GS & WG). These federal employees are grossly OVERPAID, and do little work. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to fire one of these slackers once they get tenure. My brother-in-law retired as a GS-14. In his last job in Wash DC, he TOOK NEWSPAPERS and MAGAZINES to work to read BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO Most civil service and wage grade federal workers sit around doing very little except for reading their benefits manual. That is a HARD FACT! TX4Life \nMost have tv\u2019s in their offices, paid for by the taxpayer, that they watch several hours a day. No one wants confrontation so they ignore it. Or they let it go because they also watch tv a good portion of the day. Some work other jobs during their required GS/WG hours even though it is prohibited. Again, no one wants confrontation so they look the other way. Some come and go as they please, never listing time off on their weekly time cards as required. At the end of the year, they take most of December off to \u201cuse or lose\u201d their accumulated \u201ctime off\u201d. It will continue and grow worse because no one is willing to do anything about it. Me \n$50,000 * 0.3 = $15,000 where 0.3 = 30% tax rate. \n$50,000 \u2013 $15,000 = $35,000 /12 = $2916 a month. \n$2916. \nNot $4000. $2916. It\u2019s even crazier than you think. By quite a wide margin. \nAdd to that I\u2019d love to see you find a rent of $1000 in Los Angeles. Anywhere. \nTry it. \nMinimum is $1400 and that\u2019s if you\u2019re living in hell with a bed that folds up into the wall. \nI\u2019m seriously considering building a cabin on some nice land in the middle of nowhere and buying a 20 year supply of Ramen noodles. I hear you can\u2026\u201cfeed\u201d (if it can be called such a thing) yourself on them for $142 a YEAR. Mr. G \nI have known plenty who are parasites. They really do work the system amazingly well. I once worked a charity-related job in a city where I found that people coming from Latin-American countries had welfare forms filled out before they even got on the plane to come here. That\u2019s rotten. \nBut it is also rotten that those who really try often can\u2019t get any help at all! That is why I know much welfare is a scam. We should be willing to help those who need it and deserve it. But, we tend to help those who don\u2019t deserve it. \nFor example, many poor American kids who can\u2019t read get no special help, while foreign nationals who are going here while their parents get educated or work fancy professional jobs get special English tutors on the tax-payers\u2019 dime. When are we going to wake up and help those we should? \nBut never, never turn against helping those who have it coming. This is one reason I cannot even support Republicans anymore. (I never did support Democrats) Too mean-spirited, too many people who have never been down and out! DaytoDay \nGood Article Michael, \nI had to take some time away from the doom and gloom for a while, although, it is impossible to escape it entirely. \nI agree with this article, I know people 1st hand who are on welfare, some in my own family who have been on welfare/govt assistance most of their adult lives. \nI worked at Walmart at one time, and one of the guys I worked with used to be a construction worker and was on welfare for 2yrs before they cut him off, he was receiving $1,000/month while on welfare compared to the $800/month working at Walmart. \nSo, I can understand why some people choose to leach off the system \u201cforever\u201d, because it literally pays more to be dependent than independent\u2026 \nStay Strong and Keep Up the Good Work! David Gurney \nNew GOP slogan:If you believe in hope,you must be a dope. Mad Max \nThe truth is, none of us really have to work hard anymore. Why get mad at the people who discovered that first. Only a sucker wants to work hard. Work is just a modern extension of slavery from ancient times. That\u2019s why people want to become rich. Because they want to be free. Free to do what they want when they please. Only a jaded fool wants to work hard, and only a jaded fool would criticize others that don\u2019t want to kill themselves making someone else\u2019s dream come true. I\u2019d rather spend more time with my family and doing the things I really love to do. Do you think the 1% care about working their butts off, NO! They care about working your butts off. It is the stupid 99% that persist in this nonsense and guess what? You\u2019ve gotten your wish.

Women bankrupted America. They sucked the system dry with all of their special women\u2019s rights and privledges, and also they drove away all of the big corporations who are afraid of frivilous lawsuits from women. \nAmerican women are sue-happy. They will sue a company or their employer for the stupidest of reasons. So can you really blame the corporations for outsourcing to countries that are not so radical feminist-like? \nAmerican women are the main ones that destroyed America. Feminism destroyed America. \nWhen are you going to start blaming the real culprits, Michael? When are you going to grow some balls and start speaking the TRUTH, instead of watering it down like a ? Michael \nMichael John Rambo \nYes but you RARELY call out WOMEN and FEMINISTS as being the main cause behind the economic collapse of America. \nAlso, American women destroyed TENS OF MILLIONS of men\u2019s lives FINANCIALLY through the divorce courts. \nSo financially destroying TENS OF MILLIONS of men\u2019s lives didn\u2019t help the economy either. \nWhen are you going to directly expose the WOMEN as the primary culprits behind this collapse? tex \nJoh Rambo?

Nobody is going to fill up a car 6 times a month here if they are employed. Try double that. \nSame goes for a $1000 a month rent or mortgage. That will barely get you a single in the worst area of the city. \nOne person could not make it under those circumstances. A family of four can completely forget about it, unless they all live in the car and eat out of the 7-11 they park behind.

This article is a shill for the fat cat rich who are so greedy that they would take social security from people who earned it and benefits from people who truly need it. \nWe never hear about the lazy government union parasites in these type of articles because thats what the real parasites who run america want to keep going. \nEven when these government employees were \u201clayed off\u201d they got full pay and benefits and did not have to apply for unemployment like private sector. Always getting some special privilege including the right to a paycheck without working. This amounts to alot of money payed for nothing and far exceeds the amount anyone receiving government benefits gets. \nAre they to work or just fill space and stand around and look stupid. Most of these \u201cjobs\u201d are not necessary but work to keep the corrupt political machine going. \nGovernment employees are a lazy pack of overpayed,overprivileged spoiled brats who think everything in life should be handed to them on a silver platter. Yet not one word will be uttered against them by their elite masters while these same masters seek to make the lives of those forced onto government benefits more miserable.

The Indians would never have understood that a person must continually pay to live on the piece of ground they were born on. So to those of you who think you are more noble for working and the poor are despicable \u2013 i say its because of you that the system keeps functioning and so its on your head. If people all thought like me then the system would end tomorrow. But they don\u2019t \u2013 so those of you who support it \u2013 its your mess so you deal with it and i will take what I can, because no man has the right to demand payment of me to live on the land so I have to take steps to circumvent the crime of what most of the rest of you created and continue to support. And by the way \u2013 this disdain for the poor \u201cparasites\u201d is one more psyop your rich masters are running on you to divide the lower and middle classes. nowwthen \nI guess if you try hard enough you can justify your disdain for taking care of yourself.

WE really don\u2019t need so much labor to make the world run \u2013 and much of our labor goes to supporting people above us, who want want want. I live happily in a lifestyle from the 1930\u2019s. It is a very full life and I have a great many hobbies and interests which do not require constant outlays of money, though oddly others who do the same things spend constantly and don\u2019t actually DO the things too much anymore. \nI can live like this, why can\u2019t they? And if they want more, fine by me \u2013 but they ought to work like dogs to produce their plastic crap, not enslave the little people! Mr. G Jeremy \nLots of anger in these comments. My suggestion: just log off (I come about once per week), and your blood pressure will drop. starr \nIt just makes me sick knowing the economic disaster America is in.

Aren\u2019t several southern conservative states among the top recipients of government aid for its citizens? Such states as Alabama and Mississippi have extremely high numbers of people on welfare. So, saying that this is a \u201cliberal\u201d problem is just being divisive. Please, keep objective in your reporting; it would lend more credibility to your articles, especially to those of us who are in the middle (like myself) or liberal (like Gary2), and not hard-core conservatives. Michael \nYes, it is true. There are people gaming the system all over the country. It just happens to be a little easier to do in very liberal areas such as Chicago. \nMichael \nEXCELLENT article. I was waiting for this one! Great job! Nex \nThis has been the case for years, just for the longest time no one wanted to notice it. We got hicks in Alabama who live off subsidies from cradle to grave and we got blacks in NY doing the same, just now when economy turned to (thank you mortgages for everyone), it all of the sudden became an issue. \nStop policing the world or conquer whoever we own money to. Or just default already and lets watch fly. Phoenix \nGreat, we\u2019ve seen the problem loud and clear. The solution however is here. This is for open minded free thinkers, those who can envision a different, better world. \nI like how you\u2019re talking solution-oriented instead of problem-oriented.

Oil country= $$$ Marcus \nWe spend less than we earn. Simple as that. Sweden is not an oil country! And we are not socialist, study our economy before ranting please!

Usually just below $900.00 dollars per month (many receive \u201cback pay\u201d which can be several thousand $). They also receive housing rental assistance, and EBT food cards. They lounge around all day and then buy alcohol and drugs with the money. This does not include all of the other freeloaders (Hoodrats-girls, having multiple children, illegals etc) who receive the same freebies.

InYoFace \nGo back to Mexico you are part of the problem Anonymous \nI will say say this\u2026 $4000 per month is MORE than enough to support a family of 5 people. \nThe problem with most Americans is they are not savvy or frugal. They are poor at micro managing and quite honestly, many suffer from narcissism and addiction. \nMany Americans live their lives ignorant of how their tools work, such as; automobiles, home appliances, computers, clothing, their own bodies. \nIf a family of 5 cannot live off of $4000 per month, they might be terrible at management, likely spending heavily on things they do NOT need to survive. Buying in excess of expensive food, luxury items, luxury clothing and accessories, cigarettes, drugs, bars, new automobiles, automobiles with poor gas mileage. \nOf course many Americans are bred in the system to believe that they were not be socially accepted if they do not own new cars, new houses, new clothes, new appliances, worship sports teams\u2026 \nThe future of many Americans will likely end up as a giant temper tantrum, with riots\u2026 followed by scores of military hosing them down and telling them to \u201cshut the fuck up and deal with it.\u201d \nI\u2019m not going to judge people, but it\u2019s the truth, people need to micro manage their lives better, not be lazy and learn how to care for their bodies and their tools. tom singa \njust had a conversation about this, how to cut back, but they cant live without a $120+ cable bill a mo, their landline with internet access, two smart phones at almost 200 a mo, I explain to them even turning up the AC o 81 or 82 during the day and no lower than 78 at night will cut that bill some 40 or more a mo, (they cant sleep if its not set at 70 degrees, My gosh, and these people thing tthey are entitled tto get GOC help! and they do! Jan Honeycutt \nThe National Guard requires my husband to have internet access and we have to pay it out of pocket. I coupon constantly, my kids get clearance clothes that are cheaper than Walmart its worth the hunt. We have about 950 a month come in after taxes every other week before taxes 1400, we have honestly needed help before and deserved it, and couldn\u2019t get it. My husband had to have surgery to remove a tumor luckily it wasn\u2019t cancerous, but he was still out of work and our insurance left us with a 1,000 dollar copay. I was in the ICU at the time of his surgery complications from a heart condition, a UTI, and extreme IBS. He ended up going back to work early, we have medical bills coming in everyday despite paying for 2 insurances. Both of our children have asthma, I have several bad health problems, and our daughter has extreme IBS and GERD on top of her asthma. I worked everyday I would now it just isn\u2019t possible and I can\u2019t get a penny of the disability I paid in despite having a non working bladder, heart condition, and epilepsy, while I watch healthy people walk around on it for Fibromyalgia and I even know of one government moocher getting 800 a month because her daughter has dyslexia! On top of that most of these people have never worked or paid a penny into disability! Our daughter has dyslexia and I would rather not manipulate the system to use my daughter as a pay check, these people have no integrity. I will admit we do have to keep our air on 71 at night due to my heart condition if I get too hot my heart rate goes up but blood pressure plummets, I seriously doubt most of the people getting their bills paid have a real need to keep their air low though, they just know they can. My husband works at a factory but he has an education and he is a staff sergeant in the Guard but still we only gross a round 42,000 a yr and one time while he was on orders he didn\u2019t get paid until a week later because of the system being down, we had to use credit cards and ask family for money. My husband only gets 2 sick days a yr I was in the hospital over 10 days last yr. We desperately needed help and because my husband is home now his 3 tours of duty count for nothing and we could not get military aid. We sunk to the ultimate low of applying for food stamps just to get a through a few months and were denied. We get cut out the wazoo to support people who refuse to help themselves, and when we needed help the door was slammed in our face. Now we\u2019re drowning in more debt due to 401k loans and credit cards we had to use during the hard times we were also forced to refinance to an armed interest rate to get by, I really hope it is easy to refinance out of it as we were told, but I doubt it, and we had no choice. Our government is horribly flawed. What this article is saying is that 4,000 a month is before taxes not after if we got half of the taxes we pay monthly we would be fine.

They\u2019re smarter and have a better culture in terms of work ethic, norms about work, etc, on average. They also live in tiny homes and drive tiny cars to achieve some of this \u201cprosperity\u201d. They also don\u2019t have much military spending, which is why they were conquered in a few weeks the last time anyone tried. A uniform ethnic makeup has helped with cultural issues of socialism as well, though this is changing. \nThere is also something to be said for the way socialist programs are administered. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to beat us at that. \nThe fact is, before the 60\u2019s welfare state we had virtually no debt problem. That is a FACT. \nWe are not Trillions in debt because of free markets and lack of government programs. That is a ridiculous leap of logic. Buckaroo Banzai \nUm, also don\u2019t forget the fact that the Scandinavian countries have been pumping oil (and wealth) out of the North Sea for 30 years now.

The monumental bureaucratic waste kind of gets lost in the shuffle of endless free money. John \nSome good comments that ring true, Brunot. NO NATION is greater than the productivity of its citizens.

Just last week, I wrote about how U.S. GDP growth numbers have been declining for three quarters in a row , and previously I wrote about how corporate defaults have surged to their highest level since the last financial crisis . Well, now we are getting some very depressing numbers from the rail industry. As you will see below, U.S. rail traffic was down more than 11 percent from a year ago in April. That is an absolutely catastrophic number, and the U.S. rail industry is feeling an enormous amount of pain right now. This also tells us that \u201cthe real economy\u201d is really slowing down, because less stuff is being shipped by rail all over the nation. \nOne of the economic commentators that I have really come to respect is Wolf Richter of WolfStreet.com . He has a really sharp eye for   in the economy and in the financial world, and I find myself quoting him more and more as time goes by. If you have not checked out his site yet, I very much encourage you to do so. \nOn Wednesday, he posted a very alarming article about what is happening to our rail industry. The kinds of numbers that we have been seeing recently are the kinds of numbers that we would expect if an economic depression was starting. The following is an excerpt from that article \u2026 \nTotal US rail traffic in April plunged 11.8% from a year ago, the Association of American Railroads reported today. Carloads of bulk commodities such as coal, oil, grains, and chemicals plummeted 16.1% to 944,339 units. \nThe coal industry is in a horrible condition and cannot compete with US natural gas at current prices. Coal-fired power plants are being retired. Demand for steam coal is plunging. Major US coal miners \u2013 even the largest one \u2013 are now bankrupt. So in April, carloads of coal plummeted 40% from the already beaten-down levels a year ago. \nBecause rail traffic is down so dramatically, many operators have large numbers of engines that are just sitting around collecting dust. In his article, Wolf Richter shared photographs from Google Earth that show some of the 292 Union Pacific engines that are sitting in the middle of the Arizona desert doing absolutely nothing. The following is one of those photographs\u2026 \nAs Wolf Richter pointed out, it costs a lot of money for these engines to just sit there doing nothing\u2026 \nThese engines are expensive pieces of equipment. When they just sit there, not pulling trains, they become \u201covercapacity,\u201d and they get very expensive. Then there are engineers and other personnel who suddenly become unproductive. Some of them have already been laid off or are getting laid off. \nAll over the world, similar numbers are coming in. For example, the Baltic Dry Index fell 30 more points on Wednesday after falling 21 on Tuesday. Global trade is really, really slowing down during the early portion of 2016. What this means on a practical level is that a lot less stuff is being bought, sold and shipped around the planet. \nIt is becoming increasingly difficult for authorities to deny that a new global recession has begun, and at this moment we are only in the very early chapters of this new crisis. \nAnother thing that I watch very closely is the velocity of money. When an economy is healthy, people feel pretty good about things and money tends to circulate fairly rapidly. For example, I may buy something from you, then you may buy something from someone else, etc. \nBut when times get tough, people tend to hold on to their money more tightly, and that is why the velocity of money goes down when recessions hit. In the chart below, the shaded areas represent recessions, and you can see that the velocity of money has declined during every single recession in the post-World War II era\u2026 \nDuring the last recession, the velocity of money declined precipitously, and that makes perfect sense. But then a funny thing happened. There was a slight bump up once the recession was over, but then it turned down again and it has kept going down ever since. \nIn fact, the velocity of money has now dropped to an all-time low. The velocity of M2 just recently dipped below 1.5 for the first time ever. \nThis is not a sign of an \u201ceconomic recovery\u201d. What this tells us is that our economy is very, very sick. \nAnd we can see evidence of this sickness all around us. For instance, the Los Angeles Times is reporting that homelessness in Los Angeles increased by 11 percent last year, and this marked the fourth year in a row that homelessness in the city has increased\u2026 \nHomelessness rose 11% in the city of Los Angeles and 5.7% in the county last year despite an intensive federal push that slashed the county ranks of homeless veterans by nearly a third, according to a report released Wednesday . \nThe increase marks the fourth consecutive year of rising homelessness in L.A., as local officials struggle to identify funding for billion-dollar plans they approved to solve the nation\u2019s most intractable homeless problem. \nLet us also not forget that about half the country is basically flat broke at this point. \nJust recently, the Federal Reserve found that 47 percent of all Americans could not pay an unexpected $400 emergency room bill without selling something or borrowing the money from somewhere. \nWith numbers such as these being reported, how in the world can anyone possibly claim that the U.S. economy is in good shape? \nIt boggles the mind, and yet there are people out there that would actually have you believe that everything is just fine. \nThe current occupant of the White House is one of them. \nWith each passing month, the real economy is getting even worse. We may not have slipped into a full-blown economic depression just yet, but it is coming. \nFor now, let us be thankful for whatever remains of our debt-fueled prosperity, because we don\u2019t deserve the massively inflated standard of living that we have been enjoying. \nWe have been consuming far more than we produce for decades, but it won\u2019t last for much longer. And when those days are gone for good, we will mourn them bitterly.

The railroad then can write them off on insurance, problem solved. Jim Speaker \nI bet A lot of those engines get graffitied soon. Randy \nThe spot price of copper is too low right now to make it worthwhile. Have you ever seen how difficult it is to take wire out of a motor or generator? It\u2019s not like peeling a grape. The health of the economy of any nation can be gauged by the price of its copper. Scarcity of copper due to it being used for motors, generators and conductors in conduits makes the price go high, lack of expansion means the price will be low. Outside of industrial use and as a medium of exchange, there\u2019s not much use for copper. Except in the brass used for bullet casings.

Unused engines are stored in large train yards where they are kept maintained until used or sold off. I doubt they are stored in AZ as aircraft. Google photos can be years out of date. \nI am not doubting the numbers for freight traffic decline but the photo is not evidence. Jim Speaker \nI know where those locomotives are stored at. They are stored on the old Southern Pacific out of service Pheonix line east of Wellington,AZ. I took A picture of A few trains their back in 1996. Amtrak used to use that line.

Especially the Treasury vault. Once in there it can only do one thing, pay the Treasury Bonds that are coming back from the BRICS countries, which makes it disappear. The black holes they tried to fill (with QE programs) and never was able to blow it away from existence are still there, and are still doing damages to the economy. . And with the energy crisis increasing, new black hole vaults have started to appear around the world, because they are trying to decouple the US dollar from the energy sector.

A person with a god complex may refuse to admit the possibility of their error or failure, even in the face of irrefutable evidence, complex, or intractable problems or difficult or impossible tasks, or may regard their personal opinions as unquestionably correct.

History repeats. Oh, sorry! That first was the book! sistersoldier \nI think the bomb shell that Trump dropped after winning the GOP nomination left a bad taste in the mouths of his supporters. He reported that he is not self funding the general election but rather will put together a finance committee with ties to George Soros to help raise the money to defeat Hillary. I\u2019m not sure but I think that some are suffering a hangover this morning as it is now apparent you cannot be a DC insider with out enlisting DC aid. Only the future will tell the whole story. But you are correct about the book. \ud83d\ude00 watchmannonthewall \nDon\u2019t know if you ever heard of Larry Burkett, was a mentor of Dave Ramsey. He wrote one novel, \u201cThe Illuminati\u201d about 1990 before his death. Seems a lot of what was in the book are actually being played out in events of today in the US. \nIt will be very interesting, and seems most likely, if Trump were to chose a running mate with strong ties to inside the Beltway and spcifically (though not actually known) with the elite. In the book, the president the people wanted but the elite didn\u2019t, was forced to chose a female VP the elite wanted and then they orchestrated events such that the Pres had to step down and, wow, they still got what they wanted! Interesting times!! sistersoldier \nWow! That is compelling! No I am not familiar with Larry Burkett but I most certainly will search to see if one of my local libraries has the novel you mentioned. If I am able to find it I will work it in with my fishing trip this weekend \u2013 if the fish are not biting I will be gearing up for the next leg of this race. We must enjoy the simple things while they last. Thanks for the heads up! watchmannonthewall \nIf I remember correctly Larry said, in the Forward, the only reason he wrote the book was because so many Christians were asking him to write a novel where he would lay out the events he thought would be most likely to occur to bring the anti-christ to power. When I read the book I sensed the content may have been prompted by the Holy Spirit, and Larry may have been more acccurate on events than he could have hoped for or dreamed. Funny thing is, I came across the book as a throwaway, cleaning out lockers, at an assembly plant I worked at 15 years ago. I need to get it out again and reread it. The book started with a major earthquake in Japan. sistersoldier \nI must find it! You appear to be a fellow truth seeker and the similarities to what is going on today appear to be striking to say the least. There is just too much going on in the world today and so much has been hidden from the masses that the truth is often buried in our past or by those who were not afraid to print what the Holy Spirit was leading them to do for a time such as this! Good information and good post! Bill \nIt is great to read good economic discourse and understand the true picture. Now let\u2019s get to some solutions. Chris \nWork hard. Stay out of debt.

Guest \nFor some, staying out of debt and saving is hard work (as in self-discipline). If you fit in either one of those two categories, then you can say the first one applies to you, too. grumpyhillbilly \nBetween the decades of lousy education and mass drug use, there is no simple fix. Steming the inflow of poverty might be a good start. End the war on men, especially white ones, would be another. And killing the Fed. Chris \nForget the trains!!

Such a confluence of events all at once\u2026. Richard O. Mann \nInformation overload. Oh yeah, that is problem too. Yes, it is an exciting time to be alive. Something about the tech market bubble deflating on one of the morning report programs. May have been Fox. Think I\u2019ll take a nap. Gay Veteran \nnot to mention outrage overload CASTIEL \none problem at a time friend K \nIn my area it was defiantly the war on coal, that killed the trains. Coal trains was about all that ran on the line. In my case it was CSX that was involved. Quite a few people were laid off. Because it ended up closing a repair shop for the railroad. People do not understand why Trump has the support, he has. Simple, people are sick and tired of D.C. making decisions, that cost them their jobs. It is really just that simple. When D.C. boasts they shut down the coal industry. You will have to excuse coal men, and railroad personnel for not cheering. SmallerGovNow2 \ngreat post k, thanks\u2026 Steeve Girard \nEven if the coal men did decide, it would not last long, because the coal they would produce would not be in acceptable standards for the buyers, for very long. K \nWould have to disagree, because I lived it. I live in the smoky mountains in Tn. Every winter, I could tell you how cold it was in Virginia, by how much smoke was in my area. This was from the coal fired electrical plants. Then around 2010 it all changed. The latest filters were installed on the stacks, and you know what. They worked. I seldom saw smoke during the winter. When it was cold enough. The ice went from opaque to being perfectly clear. But they had already decided to kill coal. So no amount of improvement mattered. The simple fact is. Once D.C. makes a decision, no amount of facts will make a difference. Their arrogance knows no bounds. sistersoldier \nYes indeed \u2018K\u2019 I agree. States such as Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia(s) are all under the same mandate by the \u201cEPA\u201d (supposedly) to reduce carbon emissions 32% by the year 2030. Converting the coal plants to natural gas which is reported to be cheaper and cleaner energy is underway where I live and near completion. There are trains collecting rust in my town as well. There is also a spike in my area of solar powered energy. Solar panels and equipment sales are soaring. Currently under construction are solar powered businesses, hotels, homes, new police station and state of the art hospital. I am not surprised to see the trains parked as they say \u201cthe only thing that is constant is change.\u201d jsmith \nCoal is an asset that this country has relied on for ages. And as you pointed out, much cleaner, and through the process of hydrogenation a cleaner gasoline than fracking can be made. I just can\u2019t understand if the Germans were relying on hydrogenation during WW2, why haven\u2019t we done it? Steeve Girard \nIt does not matter where the mercury ends, in the environment or the filters as you say. It\u2019s the quality of coal that is the problem: it\u2019s EROEI, Coal is getting more and more costly to produce and contains more impurities with passing time. It is only a matter of time before, it\u2019s grade is not acceptable. Mark \nGood observation and agree. mtntrek3 \nCoal will always have a part in the energy sector, but I\u2019m not seeing it returning to levels in the days of yesteryear. I\u2019ve suffered job losses because of the downturn in coal as well. The thing is all of the shale gas production has brought natural gas cost down considerably in the country, and of course gas burns cleaner. It has an unfair advantage in that respect over coal easily. We need some suitable substitutes for the coal industry jobs lost in the country for sure. If corporate greed would stand aside to allow our jobs to come back to the country\u2026\u2026. it would be a big help. We manufacture little of what we use/consume in the country. Globalism is another factor in all of this. God help. Mike_Travis \nCoal would be much less expensive were it not for the insane regulations that no one else in the world follows. Besides, it is NOT a function of the government to choose winners and losers in the market, nor is it within their power to CREATE losers which they frequently do. \nGlobalism is the driving force behind all this mess which is why we are in this mess as governments everywhere WANT a collapse so they can force their criminal NWO on us all, then rule over us as subjects, NOT citizens. mtntrek3 \nYes\u2026. globalism being pushed by the powers that be in this world the main problem. We don\u2019t need all the reg\u2019s on coal , but some are needed to keep pollution down. Nat. gas very cheap now and burns cleaner that coal that\u2019s been scrubbed\u2026\u2026.. so that\u2019s why coal is hurting so much now. Coal may make somewhat of a comeback in the future depending on what happens to gas production and geopolitical events here/worldwide. XSANDIEGOCA \n\u201cHow did you go bankrupt?\u201d \nTwo ways.

I think Obama & our economists that are so optimistic about our economy are running out of lipstick.

Randy \n  that truth since 1996, the year I found out just how the world wide fiat paper currency/electronic bookkeeping entry financial system scam is actually set up and runs! And who wanted to listen to me and take real steps to get out of the way of that runaway train that is going to fly off the rails when it hits the curve? NOBODY!! Everyone I talked to said that I was a nut job, didn\u2019t know what I was talking about, et cetera, except for one guy. He did some preps, but then let life get in the way and undid most of it. Now he and his family are left standing nearly naked out in the cold night air. 1996 was also the year I wrote my first treatise on the subject, called What is Money? and it was ignored by most whom I shared it with. Steeve Girard \nYou can\u2019t make blind people read or deaf people hear. Randy \nYes, I have seen that over and over again. But I still do my best to give them sight and make them hear. Mark Sivad \nWhere I live in South Texas, I see many fairly new tank cars and bottom-dropping bulk carriers similarly stockpiled in places they never have been before (causing some local cities to complain).

JustBill \nIf the American household is the center of the American economy, then the products and services it purchases, the wages earned by and the taxes/rent from collected from would drive the economy. \nIf the economy and financial systems were not artificial then I think Production and Consumption would be shackled together. \nWe\u2019ve been provided data that displays the retail slowdown, slowdown of both CONUS and OCONUS shipping, decreasing velocity of money, and many traditional concrete indicators of activity and economic health and all are trending down. \nCollapse or not nothing financial or economically appear to be healthy. \nIs this the new normal?

They have put out there for some R&R and to soak up some rays. mister_roboto \nThe same would be true if a caucasian member of the other major party were sitting in the Oval Office right now. Obama is as bought and paid for as nearly any other politician, so he says exactly what he is payed and commanded to say. The Kool-Aid drinkers of both of the major parties who are in the economic top 20%, as well as those who identify with them, have been increasingly adopted what I would call a \u201cprison guard\u201d sort of mentality towards the rest of society! House of Cards \nThe most alarming stat here is the crashing velocity of money, how fast money changes hands. If money isn\u2019t changing hands often, then the economy is slowing, period. These zero interest rates are creating more distortions. And the fact that the velocity of money is crashing along with zero rates is quite alarming. A major divergence. This cannot continue indefinitely. Orange Jean \nI wouldn\u2019t put too much stock in a photo from Goggle Earth showing a bunch of trains in the desert\u2026 unless there was other data proving they are idle. \nYears ago I took Amtrack cross country (from New Orleans to Chicago and then from Chicago to Orange County, CA). Going through the desert they had to stop and creep \u2026 no more than 30 mph they said because it was too hot and if it gets too hot the train could derail. We were 11 hrs late getting into CA from the last leg of my journey where I stopped in SLC for a week. WTP1776 \nObama promised that he would destroy the coal industry. sharonsj \nWell, if the stupid politicians had not taken bribes from the auto and gas industry, we might still have a functioning rail system instead so that ordinary people could still travel by train. \nI live in a rural area with no public transportation. All the small towns still have a rail line (and railroad stations) that are hardly used. If I could take a trail to the big city for shopping and entertainment, I would do it a minute. \nMeanwhile, as the rich get richer and the rest of us are impoverished, there is no extra money for us to buy anything other than the necessities. angie hoekstra \nHelpful writing .

                              "text": "Follow @ZeeNews \nMadam Speaker, \nOn this auspicious day of Vasant Panchami, I rise to present the Budget for 2017-18. Spring is a season of optimism. I extend my warm greetings to everyone on this occasion. \n2. Madam Speaker, our Government was elected amidst huge expectations of the people. The underlying theme of countless expectations was good governance. The expectations included burning issues like inflation and price rise, corruption in day to day transactions and crony capitalism. There was also expectation for a major change in the way the country\u2019s natural resources were allocated, processed and deployed. \n3. In the last two and half years, it has been our mission to bring a Transformative Shift in the way our country is governed. We have moved from a discretionary administration to a policy and system based administration; from favouritism to transparency and objectivity in decision making; from blanket and loose entitlements to targeted delivery; and from informal economy to formal economy. \nInflation, which was in double digits, has been controlled; sluggish growth has been replaced by high growth; and a massive war against black money has been launched. We have worked tirelessly on all these fronts and feel encouraged by the unstinted support of the people to our initiatives. The Government is now seen as a trusted custodian of public money. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the people of India for their strong support. \n4. We shall continue to undertake many more measures to ensure that the fruits of growth reach the farmers, the workers, the poor, the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, women and other vulnerable sections of our society. Our focus will be on energising our youth to reap the benefits of growth and employment. \n5. Madam Speaker, I am presenting this Budget when the world economy faces considerable uncertainty, in the aftermath of major economic and political developments during the last one year. Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that world GDP will grow by 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017. The advanced economies are expected to increase their growth from 1.6% to 1.9% and the emerging economies from 4.1% to 4.5%. As per current indications, macro-economic policy is expected to be more expansionary in certain large economies. Growth in a number of emerging economies is expected to recover in 2017, after relatively poor performance in 2016. These are positive signs and point to an optimistic outlook for the next year. \n6. There are, however, three major challenges for emerging economies. First, the current monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve, to increase the policy rates more than once in 2017, may lead to lower capital inflows and higher outflows from the emerging economies. Second, the uncertainty around commodity prices, especially that of crude oil, has implications for the fiscal situation of emerging economies. It is however expected that increase, if any, in oil prices would get tempered by quick response from producers of shale gas and oil. This would have a sobering impact on prices of crude and petroleum. Third, in several parts of the world, there are signs of increasing retreat from globalisation of goods, services and people, as pressures for protectionism are building up. These developments have the potential to affect exports from a number of emerging markets, including India. \n7. Amidst all these developments, India stands out as a bright spot in the world economic landscape. India\u2019s macro-economic stability continues to be the foundation of economic success. CPI inflation declined from 6% in July 2016 to 3.4% in December, 2016 and is expected to remain within RBI\u2019s mandated range of 2% to 6%. Favourable price developments reflect prudent macro-economic management, resulting in higher agricultural production, especially in pulses. India\u2019s Current Account Deficit declined from about 1% of GDP last year to 0.3% of GDP in the first half of 2016-17. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) increased from Rs 1,07,000 crores in the first half of last year to Rs 1,45,000 crores in the first half of 2016-17. This marks an increase by 36%, despite 5% reduction in global FDI inflows. Foreign exchange reserves have reached 361 billion US Dollars as on 20th January, 2017, which represents a comfortable cover for about 12 months of imports. \n8. The Government has also continued on the steady path of fiscal consolidation, without compromising on the public investment requirements of the economy. Externally, the economy successfully weathered a number of shocks, the redemption of FCNR deposits, volatility from the US elections and the Fed rate hike. According to IMF forecast, India is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in 2017. \n9. A number of global reports and assessments, over the last two years, have shown that India has considerably improved its policies, practices and economic profile. These are reflected in Doing Business Report of the World Bank; World Investment Report 2016 of UNCTAD; Global Competitiveness Report of 2015-16 and 2016-17 of the World Economic Forum; and several other Reports. India has become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth previously. We are seen as an engine of global growth. \n10. In the last one year, our country has witnessed historic and impactful economic reforms and policy making. In fact, India was one of the very few economies undertaking transformational reforms. There were two tectonic policy initiatives, namely, passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill for GST and the progress for its implementation ; and demonetisation of high denomination bank notes. The advantages of GST for our economy in terms of spurring growth, competitiveness, indirect tax simplification and greater transparency have already been extensively discussed in both Houses of Parliament. I thank all Members of both the Houses for having passed the Constitution Amendment unanimously. I also thank the State Governments for resolving all relevant issues in the GST Council. \n11. Demonetisation of high denomination bank notes was in continuation of a series of measures taken by our Government during the last two years. It is a bold and decisive measure. For several decades, tax evasion for many has become a way of life. This compromises the larger public interest and creates unjust enrichment in favour of the tax evader, to the detriment of the poor and deprived. This has bred a parallel economy which is unacceptable for an inclusive society. Demonetisation seeks to create a new \u2018normal\u2019 wherein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real. This exercise is part of our Government\u2019s resolve to eliminate corruption, black money, counterfeit currency and terror funding. Like all reforms, this measure is obviously disruptive, as it seeks to change the retrograde status quo. Drop in economic activity, if any, on account of the currency squeeze during the remonetisation period is expected to have only a transient impact on the economy. I am reminded here of what the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, had said: \u201cA right cause never fails\u201d. \n12. Demonetisation has strong potential to generate long-term benefits in terms of reduced corruption, greater digitisation of the economy, increased flow of financial savings and greater formalisation of the economy, all of which would eventually lead to higher GDP growth and tax revenues. Demonetisation helps to transfer resources from the tax evaders to the Government, which can use these resources for the welfare of the poor and the deprived. There is early evidence of an increased capacity of Banks to lend at reduced interest rates and a huge shift towards digitisation among all sections of society. We firmly believe that demonetisation and GST which were built on the third transformational achievement of our Government, namely, the JAM vision, will have an epoch making impact on our economy and the lives of our people. \n13. Madam Speaker, we are at an important turning point in the path of our growth and development. \nIs Mod pe ghabrakar na thamm jaiye aap \nJo baat nayi hai ussey apnaiye aap \nDarte hain nayi raah pe kyon chalne se aap \nHum aagey aagey chalte hain aa jaiye aap \n\n14. The pace of remonetisation has picked up and will soon reach comfortable levels. The effects of demonetisation are not expected to spill over into the next year. Thus IMF, even while revising India\u2019s GDP forecast for 2016 downwards, has projected a GDP growth of 7.2% and 7.7% in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The World Bank, however, is more optimistic and has projected a GDP growth of 7% in 2016-17, 7.6% in 2017-18 and 7.8% in 2018-19. This pick up in our economy is premised upon our policy and determination to continue with economic reforms; increase in public investment in infrastructure and development projects; and export growth in the context of the expected rebound in world economy. The surplus liquidity in the banking system, created by demonetisation, will lower borrowing costs and increase the access to credit. This will boost economic activity, with multiplier effects. \n15. The announcements made by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st December, 2016 address many of the key concerns of our economy at this juncture, such as, housing for the poor; relief to farmers; credit support to MSMEs; encouragement to digital transactions; assistance to pregnant women and senior citizens; and priority to dalits, tribals, backward classes and women under the Mudra Yojana. \n16. My overall approach, while preparing this Budget, has been to spend more in rural areas, infrastructure and poverty alleviation and yet maintain the best standards of fiscal prudence. I have also kept in mind the need to continue with economic reforms, promote higher investments and accelerate growth. \n17. The last one year was a witness to other major reforms, namely, enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; amendment to the RBI Act for inflation targeting; enactment of the Aadhar bill for disbursement of financial subsidies and benefits; significant reforms in FDI policy; the job creating package for textile sector; and several other measures. We will continue the process of economic reforms for the benefit of the poor and the underprivileged. \n18. Madam Speaker, the Budget for 2017-18 contains three major reforms. First, the presentation of the Budget has been advanced to 1st February to enable the Parliament to avoid a Vote on Account and pass a single Appropriation Bill for 2017-18, before the close of the current financial year. This would enable the Ministries and Departments to operationalise all schemes and projects, including the new schemes, right from the commencement of the next financial year. They would be able to fully utilise the available working season before the onset of the monsoon. Second, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget is a historic step. We have discontinued the colonial practice prevalent since 1924. This decision brings the Railways to the centre stage of Government\u2019s fiscal policy and would facilitate multi modal transport planning between railways, highways and inland waterways. The functional autonomy of Railways will, however, continue. Third, we have done away with the plan and non-plan classification of expenditure. This will give us a holistic view of allocations for sectors and ministries. This would facilitate optimal allocation of resources. \n19. Madam Speaker, we are aware that we need to do more for our people. Continuing with the task of fulfilling the people\u2019s expectations, our agenda for the next year is : \u201cTransform, Energise and Clean India\u201d, that is, TEC India. This agenda of TEC India seeks to Transform the quality of governance and quality of life of our people; Energise various sections of society, especially the youth and the vulnerable, and enable them to unleash their true potential; and Clean the country from the evils of corruption, black money and non-transparent political funding. \nI propose to present my Budget proposals under ten distinct themes to foster this broad agenda. The themes are : \n(i) Farmers : for whom we have committed to double the income in 5 years; \n(ii) Rural Population : providing employment and basic infrastructure; \n(iii) Youth : energising them through education, skills and jobs; \n(iv) Poor and the Underprivileged : strengthening the systems of social security, health care and affordable housing; \n(v) Infrastructure: for efficiency, productivity and quality of life; \n(vi) Financial Sector : growth and stability through stronger institutions; \n(vii) Digital Economy : for speed, accountability and transparency; \n(viii) Public Service : effective governance and efficient service delivery through people\u2019s participation; \n(ix) Prudent Fiscal Management : to ensure optimal deployment of resources and preserve fiscal stability; and \n(x) Tax Administration : honouring the honest. \nI. FARMERS \n20. The Indian farmer has once again shown his commitment and resilience in the current year. The total area sown under kharif and rabi seasons are higher than the previous year. With a better monsoon, agriculture is expected to grow at 4.1% in the current year. \n21. In last year\u2019s Budget speech, I focused on \u2018income security\u2019 of farmers to double their income in 5 years. I had also announced a number of measures. We have to take more steps and enable the farmers to increase their production and productivity; and to deal with post-harvest challenges. \n22. For a good crop, adequate credit should be available to farmers in time. The target for agricultural credit in 2017-18 has been fixed at a record level of Rs 10 lakh crores. We will take special efforts to ensure adequate flow of credit to the under serviced areas, the Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir. The farmers will also benefit from 60 days\u2019 interest waiver announced by Honourable Prime Minister in respect of their loans from the cooperative credit structure. \n23. About 40% of the small and marginal farmers avail credit from the cooperative structure. The Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) act as the front end for loan disbursements. We will support NABARD for computerisation and integration of all 63,000 functional PACS with the Core Banking System of District Central Cooperative Banks. This will be done in 3 years at an estimated cost of Rs 1,900 crores, with financial participation from State Governments. This will ensure seamless flow of credit to small and marginal farmers. \n24. At the time of sowing, farmers should feel secure against natural calamities. The Fasal Bima Yojana launched by our Government is a major step in this direction. The coverage of this scheme will be increased from 30% of cropped area in 2016-17 to 40% in 2017-18 and 50% in 2018-19. The Budget provision of Rs 5,500 crores for this Yojana in BE 2016-17 was increased to Rs 13,240 crores in RE 2016-17 to settle the arrear claims. For 2017-18, I have provided a sum of Rs 9,000 crores. The sum insured under this Yojana has more than doubled from Rs 69,000 crores in Kharif 2015 to Rs 1,41,625 crores in Kharif 2016. \n25. Issuance of Soil Health Cards has gathered momentum. The real benefit to farmers would be available only when the soil samples are tested quickly and nutrient level of the soil is known. Government will therefore set up new mini labs in Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and ensure 100% coverage of all 648 KVKs in the country. In addition, 1000 mini labs will be set up by qualified local entrepreneurs. Government will provide credit linked subsidy to these entrepreneurs. \n26. A Long Term Irrigation Fund has already been set up in NABARD. Honourable Prime Minister has announced an addition of Rs 20,000 crores to its corpus. This will take the total corpus of this Fund to Rs 40,000 crores. \n27. A dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund will be set up in NABARD to achieve the goal, \u2018per drop more crop\u2019. The Fund will have an initial corpus of Rs 5,000 crores. \n28. For the post-harvest phase, we will take steps to enable farmers to get better prices for their produce in the markets. The coverage of National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) will be expanded from the current 250 markets to 585 APMCs. Assistance up to a ceiling of Rs 75 lakhs will be provided to every e-NAM market for establishment of cleaning, grading and packaging facilities. This will lead to value addition of farmers\u2019 produce. \n29. Market reforms will be undertaken and the States would be urged to denotify perishables from APMC. This will give opportunity to farmers to sell their produce and get better prices. \n30. We also propose to integrate farmers who grow fruits and vegetables with agro processing units for better price realisation and reduction of post-harvest losses. A model law on contract farming would therefore be prepared and circulated among the States for adoption. \n31. Dairy is an important source of additional income for the farmers. Availability of milk processing facility and other infrastructure will benefit the farmers through value addition. A large number of milk processing units set up under the Operation Flood Programme has since become old and obsolete. A Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund would be set up in NABARD with a corpus of Rs 8,000 crores over 3 years. Initially, the Fund will start with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crores. \nII. RURAL POPULATION \n32. I now turn to the Rural Sector, which was so dear to the heart of Mahatma Gandhi. \n33. Over Rs 3 lakh crores are spent in rural areas every year, if we add up all the programmes meant for rural poor from the Central Budget, State Budgets, Bank linkage for self-help groups, etc. With a clear focus on improving accountability, outcomes and convergence, we will undertake a Mission Antyodaya to bring one crore households out of poverty and to make 50,000 gram panchayats poverty free by 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji. We will utilise the existing resources more effectively along with annual increases. This mission will work with a focused micro plan for sustainable livelihood for every deprived household. A composite index for poverty free gram panchayats would be developed to monitor the progress from the baseline. \n34. Our Government has made a conscious effort to reorient MGNREGA to support our resolve to double farmers\u2019 income. While providing at least 100 days employment to every rural household, MGNREGA should create productive assets to improve farm productivity and incomes. The target of 5 lakh farm ponds and 10 lakh compost pits announced in the last Budget from MGNREGA funds will be fully achieved. In fact, against 5 lakh farm ponds, it is expected that about 10 lakh farm ponds would be completed by March 2017. During 2017-18, another 5 lakh farm ponds will be taken up. This single measure will contribute greatly to drought proofing of gram panchayats. \n35. Participation of women in MGNREGA has increased to 55% from less than 48% in the past. \n36. Honourable Members would be happy to note that the budget provision of Rs 38,500 crores under MGNREGA in 2016-17 has been increased to Rs 48,000 crores in 2017-18. This is the highest ever allocation for MGNREGA. The initiative to geo-tag all MGNREGA assets and putting them in public domain has established greater transparency. We are also using space technology in a big way to plan MGNREGA works. \n37. The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is now being implemented as never before. The pace of construction of PMGSY roads has accelerated to reach 133 km roads per day in 2016-17, as against an average of 73 km during the period 2011-2014. We have also taken up the task of connecting habitations with more than 100 persons in left wing extremism affected Blocks. We have committed to complete the current target under PMGSY by 2019. I have provided a sum of Rs 19,000 crores in 2017-18 for this scheme. Together with the contribution of States, an amount of Rs 27,000 crores will be spent on PMGSY in 2017-18. \n38. We propose to complete 1 crore houses by 2019 for the houseless and those living in kutcha houses. I have stepped up the allocation for Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana \u2013 Gramin from Rs 15,000 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 23,000 crores in 2017-18. \n39. We are well on our way to achieving 100% village electrification by 1st May 2018. An increased allocation of Rs 4,814 crores has been proposed under the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana in 2017-18. \n40. I have also proposed to increase the allocations for Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission for promotion of skill development and livelihood opportunities for people in rural areas to Rs 4,500 in 2017-18. The allocation for Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) and credit support schemes has been increased more than 3 times. \n41. Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) has made tremendous progress in promoting safe sanitation and ending open defecation. Sanitation coverage in rural India has gone up from 42% in October 2014 to about 60%. Open Defecation Free villages are now being given priority for piped water supply. \n42. We propose to provide safe drinking water to over 28,000 arsenic and fluoride affected habitations in the next four years. This will be a sub mission of the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). \n43. For imparting new skills to the people in the rural areas, mason training will be provided to 5 lakh persons by 2022, with an immediate target of training at least 20,000 persons by 2017-18. \n44. Panchayati raj institutions still lack human resources for implementing development programmes. A programme of \u201chuman resource reforms for results\u201d will be launched during 2017-18 for this purpose. \n45. The Government will continue to work closely with the farmers and the people in the rural areas to improve their life and environment. This is a non-negotiable agenda for our Government. The total allocation for the rural, agriculture and allied sectors in 2017-18 is Rs 1,87,223 crores, which is 24% higher than the previous year. \nIII. YOUTH \n46. Let me now focus on my proposals for the youth. \n47. Quality education will energise our youth. In the words of Swami Vivekananda, \u201cThe education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for the struggle for life \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 is it worth the name?\u201d \n48. We have proposed to introduce a system of measuring annual learning outcomes in our schools. Emphasis will be given on science education and flexibility in curriculum to promote creativity through local innovative content. \n49. An Innovation Fund for Secondary Education will be created to encourage local innovation for ensuring universal access, gender parity and quality improvement. This will include ICT enabled learning transformation. The focus will be on 3479 educationally backward blocks. \n50. In higher education, we will undertake reforms in the UGC. Good quality institutions would be enabled to have greater administrative and academic autonomy. Colleges will be identified based on accreditation and ranking, and given autonomous status. A revised framework will be put in place for outcome based accreditation and credit based programmes. \n51. We propose to leverage information technology and launch SWAYAM platform with at least 350 online courses. This would enable students to virtually attend the courses taught by the best faculty; access high quality reading resources; participate in discussion forums; take tests and earn academic grades. Access to SWAYAM would be widened by linkage with DTH channels, dedicated to education. \n52. We propose to establish a National Testing Agency as an autonomous and self-sustained premier testing organisation to conduct all entrance examinations for higher education institutions. This would free CBSE, AICTE and other premier institutions from these administrative responsibilities so that they can focus more on academics. \n53. We have a huge demographic advantage. Skill India mission was launched in July 2015 to maximise the potential of our youth. \n54. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKK) have already been promoted in more than 60 districts. We now propose to extend these Kendras to more than 600 districts across the country. 100 India International Skills Centres will be established across the country. These Centres would offer advanced training and also courses in foreign languages. This will help those of our youth who seek job opportunities outside the country. \n55. In 2017-18, we also propose to launch the Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion programme (SANKALP) at a cost of Rs 4,000 crores. SANKALP will provide market relevant training to 3.5 crore youth. \n56. The next phase of Skill Strengthening for Industrial Value Enhancement (STRIVE) will also be launched in 2017-18 at a cost of Rs 2,200 crores. STRIVE will focus on improving the quality and market relevance of vocational training provided in ITIs and strengthen the apprenticeship programmes through industry cluster approach. \n57. A special scheme for creating employment in the textile sector has already been launched. A similar scheme will be implemented for the leather and footwear industries. \n58. Tourism is a big employment generator and has a multiplier impact on the economy. Five Special Tourism Zones, anchored on SPVs, will be set up in partnership with the States. Incredible India 2.0 Campaign will be launched across the world. \nIV. THE POOR AND THE UNDERPRIVILEGED \n59. Madam Speaker, I now turn to my proposals for the poor and the underprivileged. \n60. Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas begins with the girl child and women. Mahila Shakti Kendra will be set up at village level with an allocation of Rs 500 crores in 14 lakh ICDS Anganwadi Centres. This will provide one stop convergent support services for empowering rural women with opportunities for skill development, employment, digital literacy, health and nutrition. A nationwide scheme for financial assistance to pregnant women has already been announced by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st December, 2016. Under this scheme, Rs 6,000 each will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children. \n61. For the welfare of Women and Children under various schemes across all Ministries, I have stepped up the allocation from Rs 1,56,528 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 1,84,632 crores in 2017-18. \n62. We propose to facilitate higher investment in affordable housing. Affordable housing will now be given infrastructure status, which will enable these projects to avail the associated benefits. \n63. The National Housing Bank will refinance individual housing loans of about Rs 20,000 crore in 2017-18. Thanks to the surplus liquidity created by demonetisation, the Banks have already started reducing their lending rates, including those for housing. In addition, interest subvention for housing loans has also been announced by the Honourable Prime Minister. \n64. Poverty is usually associated with poor health. It is the poor who suffer the maximum from various chronic diseases. Government has therefore prepared an action plan to eliminate Kala-Azar and Filariasis by 2017, Leprosy by 2018 and Measles by 2020. Elimination of tuberculosis by 2025 is also targeted. Similarly, action plan has been prepared to reduce IMR from 39 in 2014 to 28 by 2019 and MMR from 167 in 2011-13 to 100 by 2018-2020. 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres will be transformed into Health and Wellness Centres. \n65. We need to ensure adequate availability of specialist doctors to strengthen Secondary and Tertiary levels of health care. We have therefore decided to take steps to create additional 5,000 Post Graduate seats per annum. In addition, steps will be taken to roll out DNB courses in big District Hospitals; strengthen PG teaching in select ESI and Municipal Corporation Hospitals; and encourage reputed Private Hospitals to start DNB courses. We will work with the State Governments to take these tasks forward. The Government is committed to take necessary steps for structural transformation of the Regulatory framework of Medical Education and Practice in India. \n66. Two new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences will be set up in the States of Jharkhand and Gujarat. \n67. We propose to amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to ensure availability of drugs at reasonable prices and promote use of generic medicines. New rules for regulating medical devices will also be formulated. These rules will be internationally harmonised and attract investment into this sector. This will reduce the cost of such devices. \n68. We are keen on fostering a conducive labour environment wherein labour rights are protected and harmonious labour relations lead to higher productivity. Legislative reforms will be undertaken to simplify, rationalise and amalgamate the existing labour laws into 4 Codes on (i) wages; (ii) industrial relations; (iii) social security and welfare; and (iv) safety and working conditions. The Model Shops and Establishment Bill 2016 has been circulated to all States for consideration and adoption. This would open up additional avenues for employment of women. The amendment made to the Payment of Wages Act, is another initiative of our Government for the benefit of the labour and ease of doing business. \n69. Our Government is giving special importance to implementation of the schemes for welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities. The allocation for the welfare of Scheduled Castes has been stepped up from Rs 38,833 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 52,393 crores in 2017-18, representing an increase of about 35%. The allocation for Scheduled Tribes has been increased to Rs 31,920 crores and for Minority Affairs to Rs 4,195 crores. The Government will introduce outcome based monitoring of expenditure in these sectors by the NITI Aayog. \n70. For senior citizens, Aadhar based Smart Cards containing their health details will be introduced. A beginning will be made through a pilot in 15 districts during 2017-18. The LIC will implement a scheme for senior citizens to provide assured pension, with a guaranteed return of 8% per annum for 10 years. \nV. INFRASTRUCTURE \n71. The fifth component of TEC India agenda is Infrastructure. \n72. Railways, roads and rivers are the lifeline of our country. I feel privileged to present the first combined Budget of independent India that includes the Railways also. We are now in a position to synergise the investments in railways, roads, waterways and civil aviation. For 2017-18, the total capital and development expenditure of Railways has been pegged at Rs 1,31,000 crores. This includes Rs 55,000 crores provided by the Government. \n73. Among other things, the Railways will focus on four major areas, namely : \n(i) Passenger safety; \n(ii) Capital and development works; \n(iii) Cleanliness; and \n(iv) Finance and accounting reforms. \n74. For passenger safety, a Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh will be created with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crores over a period of 5 years. Besides seed capital from the Government, the Railways will arrange the balance resources from their own revenues and other sources. Government will lay down clear cut guidelines and timeline for implementing various safety works to be funded from this Kosh. Unmanned level crossings on Broad Gauge lines will be eliminated by 2020. Expert international assistance will be harnessed to improve safety preparedness and maintenance practices. \n75. In the next 3 years, the throughput is proposed to be enhanced by 10%. This will be done through modernisation and upgradation of identified corridors. Railway lines of 3,500 kms will be commissioned in 2017-18, as against 2,800 kms in 2016-17. Steps will be taken to launch dedicated trains for tourism and pilgrimage. \n76. Railways have set up joint ventures with 9 State Governments. 70 projects have been identified for construction and development. \n77. A beginning has been made with regard to station redevelopment. At least 25 stations are expected to be awarded during 2017-18 for station redevelopment. 500 stations will be made differently abled friendly by providing lifts and escalators. \n78. It is proposed to feed about 7,000 stations with solar power in the medium term. A beginning has already been made in 300 stations. Works will be taken up for 2,000 railway stations as part of 1000 MW solar mission. \n79. Our focus is on swachh rail. SMS based Clean My Coach Service has been started. It is now proposed to introduce \u2018Coach Mitra\u2019 facility, a single window interface, to register all coach related complaints and requirements. By 2019, all coaches of Indian Railways will be fitted with bio toilets. Pilot plants for environment friendly disposal of solid waste and conversion of biodegradable waste to energy are being set up at New Delhi and Jaipur railway stations. Five more such solid waste management plants are now being taken up. \n80. Today Indian Railways face stiff competition from other modes of transportation which are dominated by the private sector. Transformative measures have to be undertaken to make Indian Railways competitive to retain their position of pre-eminence. The following steps will therefore be taken : \n(i) Railways will implement end to end integrated transport solutions for select commodities through partnership withlogistics players, who would provide both front and back end connectivity. Rolling stocks and practices will be customised to transport perishable goods, especially agricultural products. \n(ii) Railways will offer competitive ticket booking facility to the public at large. Service charge on e-tickets booked through IRCTC has been withdrawn. Cashless reservations have gone up from 58% to 68%. \n(iii) As part of accounting reforms, accrual based financial statements will be rolled out by March 2019. \n81. It will be our continuous endeavour to improve the Operating Ratio of the Railways. The tariffs of Railways would be fixed, taking into consideration costs, quality of service, social obligations and competition from other forms of transport. \n82. Metro rail is emerging as an important mode of urban transportation. A new Metro Rail Policy will be announced with focus on innovative models of implementation and financing, as well as standardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software. This will open up new job opportunities for our youth. \n83. A new Metro Rail Act will be enacted by rationalising the existing laws. This will facilitate greater private participation and investment in construction and operation. \n84. In the road sector, I have stepped up the Budget allocation for highways from Rs 57,976 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 64,900 crores in 2017-18. 2,000 kms of coastal connectivity roads have been identified for construction and development. This will facilitate better connectivity with ports and remote villages. The total length of roads, including those under PMGSY, built from 2014-15 till the current year is about 1,40,000 kms which is significantly higher than previous three years. \n85. An effective multi modal logistics and transport sector will make our economy more competitive. A specific programme for development of multi-modal logistics parks, together with multi modal transport facilities, will be drawn up and implemented. \n86. Select airports in Tier 2 cities will be taken up for operation and maintenance in the PPP mode. Airport Authority of India Act will be amended to enable effective monetisation of land assets. The resources, so raised, will be utilised for airport upgradation. \n87. For transportation sector as a whole, including rail, roads, shipping, I have provided Rs 2,41,387 crores in 2017-18. This magnitude of investment will spur a huge amount of economic activity across the country and create more job opportunities. \n88. Telecom sector is an important component of our infrastructure eco system. The recent spectrum auctions have removed spectrum scarcity in the country. This will give a major fillip to mobile broadband and Digital India for the benefit of people living in rural and remote areas. \n89. Under the BharatNet Project, OFC has been laid in 1,55,000 kms. I have stepped up the allocation for BharatNet Project to Rs 10,000 crores in 2017-18. By the end of 2017-18, high speed broadband connectivity on optical fibre will be available in more than 1,50,000 gram panchayats, with wifi hot spots and access to digital services at low tariffs. A DigiGaon initiative will be launched to provide tele-medicine, education and skills through digital technology. \n90. For strengthening our Energy sector, Government has decided to set up Strategic Crude Oil Reserves. In the first phase, 3 such Reserves facilities have been set up. Now in the second phase, it is proposed to set up caverns at 2 more locations, namely, Chandikhole in Odisha and Bikaner in Rajasthan. This will take our strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 MMT. \n91. In solar energy, we now propose to take up the second phase of Solar Park development for additional 20,000 MW capacity. \n92. We are also creating an eco-system to make India a global hub for electronics manufacturing. Over 250 investment proposals for electronics manufacturing have been received in the last 2 years, totalling an investment of Rs 1.26 lakh crores. A number of global leaders and mobile manufacturers have set up production facilities in India. I have therefore exponentially increased the allocation for incentive schemes like M-SIPS and EDF to Rs 745 crores in 2017-18. This is an all-time high. \n93. We have to focus on our export infrastructure in a competitive world. A new and restructured Central scheme, namely, Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) will be launched in 2017-18. \n94. The total allocation for infrastructure development in 2017-18 stands at Rs 3,96,135 crores. \nVI. FINANCIAL SECTOR \n95. I now turn to the Financial Sector. The focus of TEC India agenda in this sector is on building stable and stronger institutions. We will continue with our reform agenda with several new measures. \n96. Our Government has already undertaken substantive reforms in FDI policy in the last two years. More than 90% of the total FDI inflows are now through the automatic route. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has successfully implemented e-filing and online processing of FDI applications. We have now reached a stage where FIPB can be phased out. We have therefore decided to abolish the FIPB in 2017-18. A roadmap for the same will be announced in the next few months. In the meantime, further liberalisation of FDI policy is under consideration and necessary announcements will be made in due course. \n97. The Commodities markets require further reforms for the benefits of farmers. An expert committee will be constituted to study and promote creation of an operational and legal framework to integrate spot market and derivatives market for commodities trading. e-NAM would be an integral part of such framework. \n98. The draft bill to curtail the menace of illicit deposit schemes has been placed in the public domain and will be introduced shortly after its finalisation. There is an urgent need to protect the poor and gullible investors from another set of dubious schemes, operated by unscrupulous entities who exploit the regulatory gaps in the Multi State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002. We will amend this Act in consultation with various stakeholders, as part of our \u2018Clean India\u2019 agenda. \n99. The bill relating to resolution of financial firms will be introduced in the current Budget Session of Parliament. This will contribute to stability and resilience of our financial system. It will also protect the consumers of various financial institutions. Together with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a resolution mechanism for financial firms will ensure comprehensiveness of the resolution system in our country. \n100. I had stated in my last Budget speech that a Bill will be introduced to streamline institutional arrangements for resolution of disputes in infrastructure related construction contracts, PPP and public utility contracts. After extensive stakeholders\u2019 consultations, we have decided that the required mechanism would be instituted as part of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. An amendment Bill will be introduced in this regard. \n101. Cyber security is critical for safeguarding the integrity and stability of our financial sector. A Computer Emergency Response Team for our Financial Sector (CERT-Fin) will be established. This entity will work in close coordination with all financial sector regulators and other stakeholders. \n102. I have also proposed several other measures in the financial sector which are listed in Annex I. \n103. Listing of Public Sector enterprises will foster greater public accountability and unlock the true value of these companies. The Government will put in place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure time bound listing of identified CPSEs on stock exchanges. The disinvestment policy announced by me in the last budget will continue. \n104. The shares of Railway PSEs like IRCTC, IRFC and IRCON will be listed in stock exchanges. \n105. We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector. We propose to create an integrated public sector \u2018oil major\u2019 which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies. \n106. Our ETF, comprising shares of ten CPSEs, has received overwhelming response in the recent Further Fund Offering (FFO). We will continue to use ETF as a vehicle for further disinvestment of shares. Accordingly, a new ETF with diversified CPSE stocks and other Government holdings will be launched in 2017-18. \n107. The focus on resolution of stressed legacy accounts of Banks continues. The legal framework has been strengthened to facilitate resolution, through the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the amendments to the SARFAESI and Debt Recovery Tribunal Acts. In line with the \u2018Indradhanush\u2019 roadmap, I have provided Rs 10,000 crores for recapitalisation of Banks in 2017-18. Additional allocation will be provided, as may be required. \n108. Listing and trading of Security Receipts issued by a securitization company or a reconstruction company under the SARFAESI Act will be permitted in SEBI registered stock exchanges. This will enhance capital flows into the securitization industry and will particularly be helpful to deal with bank NPAs. \n109. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana has contributed significantly to funding the unfunded and the underfunded. Last year, the target of Rs 1.22 lakh crores was exceeded. For 2017-18, I propose to double the lending target of 2015-16 and set it at Rs 2.44 lakh crores. Priority will be given to Dalits, Tribals, Backward Classes, Minorities and Women. \n110. The Stand Up India scheme was launched by our Government in April 2016 to support Dalit, Tribal and Women entrepreneurs to set up greenfield enterprises and become job creators. Over 16,000 new enterprises have come up through this scheme in activities, as diverse as food processing, garments, diagnostic centres, etc. \nVII. DIGITAL ECONOMY \n111. Promotion of a digital economy is an integral part of Government\u2019s strategy to clean the system and weed out corruption and black money. It has a transformative impact in terms of greater formalisation of the economy and mainstreaming of financial savings into the banking system. This, in turn, is expected to energise private investment in the country through lower cost of credit. India is now on the cusp of a massive digital revolution. \n112. A shift to digital payments has huge benefits for the common man. The earlier initiative of our Government to promote financial inclusion and the JAM trinity were important precursors to our current push for digital transactions. \n113. Already there is evidence of increased digital transactions. The BHIM app has been launched. It will unleash the power of mobile phones for digital payments and financial inclusion. 125 lakh people have adopted the BHIM app so far. The Government will launch two new schemes to promote the usage of BHIM; these are, Referral Bonus Scheme for individuals and a Cashback Scheme for merchants. \n114. Aadhar Pay, a merchant version of Aadhar Enabled Payment System, will be launched shortly. This will be specifically beneficial for those who do not have debit cards, mobile wallets and mobile phones. A Mission will be set up with a target of 2,500 crore digital transactions for 2017-18 through UPI, USSD, Aadhar Pay, IMPS and debit cards. Banks have targeted to introduce additional 10 lakh new PoS terminals by March 2017. They will be encouraged to introduce 20 lakh Aadhar based PoS by September 2017. \n115. Increased digital transactions will enable small and micro enterprises to access formal credit. Government will encourage SIDBI to refinance credit institutions which provide unsecured loans, at reasonable interest rates, to borrowers based on their transaction history. \n116. The digital payment infrastructure and grievance handling mechanisms shall be strengthened. The focus would be on rural and semi urban areas through Post Offices, Fair Price Shops and Banking Correspondents. Steps would be taken to promote and possibly mandate petrol pumps, fertilizer depots, municipalities, Block offices, road transport offices, universities, colleges, hospitals and other institutions to have facilities for digital payments, including BHIM App. A proposal to mandate all Government receipts through digital means, beyond a prescribed limit, is under consideration. \n117. Government will strengthen the Financial Inclusion Fund to augment resources for taking up these initiatives. \n118. Government will consider and work with various stakeholders for early implementation of the interim recommendations of the Committee of Chief Ministers on digital transactions. \n119. The Committee on Digital Payments constituted by Department of Economic Affairs has recommended structural reforms in the payment eco system, including amendments to the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. Government will undertake a comprehensive review of this Act and bring about appropriate amendments. To begin with, it is proposed to create a Payments Regulatory Board in the Reserve Bank of India by replacing the existing Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems. Necessary amendments are proposed to this effect in the Finance Bill 2017. \n120. As we move faster on the path of digital transactions and cheque payments, we need to ensure that the payees of dishonoured cheques are able to realise the payments. Government is therefore considering the option of amending the Negotiable Instruments Act suitably. \nVIII. PUBLIC SERVICE \n121. I now turn to Public Service. Our focus here is on effective government and efficient service delivery. \n122. We have made a strong beginning with regard to Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to LPG and kerosene consumers. Chandigarh and eight districts of Haryana have become kerosene free. 84 Government schemes have also boarded on the DBT platform. \n123. The Government e-market place which is now functional for procurement of goods and services, has been selected as one of the winners of the South Asia Procurement Innovation Awards of the World Bank. \n124. Our citizens in far flung regions of the country find it difficult to obtain passports and redress passport related grievances. We have decided to utilise the Head Post Offices as front offices for rendering passport services. \n125. Our defence forces keep the country safe from both external and internal threats. A Centralised Defence Travel System has now been developed through which travel tickets can be booked online by our soldiers and officers. They do not have to face the hassle of standing in queues with railway warrants. \n126. A comprehensive web based interactive Pension Disbursement System for Defence Pensioners will be established. This system will receive pension proposals and make payments centrally. This will reduce the grievances of defence pensioners. \n127. At present our citizens, especially those belonging to the poor and unprivileged sections, go through cumbersome procedures of Government recruitment. There are multiplicity of agencies and examinations. We propose to introduce a system of single registration and two tier system of examination. \n128. Over the years, the number of tribunals have multiplied with overlapping functions. We propose to rationalise the number of tribunals and merge tribunals wherever appropriate. \n129. In the recent past, there have been instances of big time offenders, including economic offenders, fleeing the country to escape the reach of law. We have to ensure that the law is allowed to take its own course. Government is therefore considering introduction of legislative changes, or even a new law, to confiscate the assets of such persons located within the country, till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum. Needless to say that all necessary constitutional safeguards will be followed in such cases. \n130. Our Government will continue to remain committed to improve the standards of public service and transparent governance. Service to the people was the life-long commitment of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. As we approach, the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Mahatma, we will take all steps to celebrate it in a befitting manner. A High Level Committee under the Chairmanship of Honourable Prime Minister is proposed to be set up for the same. We will also commemorate the centenary year of Champaran Satyagrah this year. Government of India will support Government of Gujarat to commemorate 100 years of Sabarmati Ashram in 2017, in a befitting manner. 200 years ago in 1817, a valiant uprising of soldiers led by Buxi Jagabandhu took place in Khordha of Odisha. We will commemorate the same appropriately. \nIX. PRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT \n131. I now turn to the fiscal situation in the context of the Budget for 2017-18. \n132. The total expenditure in Budget for 2017-18 has been placed at Rs 21.47 lakh crores. With the abolition of Plan-Non Plan classification of expenditure, the focus is now on Revenue and Capital expenditure. I have stepped up the allocation for Capital expenditure by 25.4% over the previous year. This will have multiplier effects and lead to higher growth. The total resources being transferred to the States and the Union Territories with Legislatures is Rs 4.11 lakh crores, against Rs 3.60 lakh crores in BE 2016-17. Details of allocations for important sectors and schemes and transfer of resources to States are given in Annex II of my Speech. \n133. I have made a provision of Rs 3,000 crores under the Department of Economic Affairs to implement various Budget announcements and other new schemes in 2017-18. For Defence expenditure excluding pensions, I have provided a sum of Rs 2,74,114 crores including Rs 86,488 crores for Defence capital. I have increased the allocation for Scientific Ministries to Rs 37,435 crore in 2017-18. \n134. For the first time, a consolidated Outcome Budget, covering all Ministries and Departments, is being laid along with the other Budget documents. This will improve accountability of Government expenditure. \n135. The FRBM Review Committee has given its report recently. The Committee has done an elaborate exercise and has recommended that a sustainable debt path must be the principal macro-economic anchor of our fiscal policy. The Committee has favoured Debt to GDP of 60% for the General Government by 2023, consisting of 40% for Central Government and 20% for State Governments. Within this framework, the Committee has derived and recommended 3% fiscal deficit for the next three years. The Committee has also provided for \u2018Escape Clauses\u2019, for deviations upto 0.5% of GDP, from the stipulated fiscal deficit target. Among the triggers for taking recourse to these Escape Clauses, the Committee has included \u201cfar-reaching structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal implications\u201d as one of the factors. Although there is a strong case now to invoke this Escape Clause, I am refraining from doing so. The Report of the Committee will be carefully examined and appropriate decisions taken in due course. \n136. Nevertheless, I take note of the fiscal deficit roadmap of 3% recommended by the Committee for the next three years. I have taken into consideration the need for higher public expenditure in the context of sluggish private sector investment and slow global growth. I have kept in mind the recommendation of the Committee that a sustainable debt should be the underlying basis of prudent fiscal management. Considering all these aspects, I have pegged the fiscal deficit for 2017-18 at 3.2% of GDP and remain committed to achieve 3% in the following year. With this gradual approach, I have ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation, without compromising the requirements of public investment. \n137. I have taken due care to limit the net market borrowing of Government to Rs 3.48 lakh crores after buyback, much lower than Rs 4.25 lakh crores of the previous year. More importantly, the Revenue Deficit of 2.3% in BE 2016-17 stands reduced to 2.1% in the Revised Estimates. The Revenue Deficit for next year is pegged at 1.9% , against 2% mandated by the FRBM Act. \n138. It will be our endeavour to improve upon these fiscal numbers, especially the fiscal deficit, in the next year, through greater focus on quality of expenditure and higher tax realisation from the huge cash deposits in Banks, triggered by demonetisation. \nPART B \nMadam Speaker, \n139. I shall now present my tax proposals: \n140. India\u2019s tax to GDP ratio is very low, and the proportion of direct tax to indirect tax is not optimal from the view point of social justice. I place before you certain data to indicate that our direct tax collection is not commensurate with the income and consumption pattern of Indian economy. As against estimated 4.2 crore persons engaged in organised sector employment, the number of individuals filing return for salary income are only 1.74 crore. As against 5.6 crore informal sector individual enterprises and firms doing small business in India, the number of returns filed by this category are only 1.81 crore. Out of the 13.94 lakh companies registered in India upto 31st March, 2014, 5.97 lakh companies have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17. Of the 5.97 lakh companies which have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17 so far, as many as 2.76 lakh companies have shown losses or zero income. 2.85 lakh companies have shown profit before tax of less than Rs 1 crore. 28,667 companies have shown profit between Rs 1 crore to Rs 10 crore, and only 7781 companies have profit before tax of more than Rs 10 crores. \n141. Among the 3.7 crore individuals who filed the tax returns in 2015-16, 99 lakh show income below the exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh p.a., 1.95 crore show income between Rs 2.5 to Rs 5 lakh, 52 lakh show income between Rs 5 to Rs 10 lakhs and only 24 lakh people show income above Rs 10 lakhs. Of the 76 lakh individual assesses who declare income above Rs 5 lakh, 56 lakh are in the salaried class. The number of people showing income more than Rs 50 lakh in the entire country is only 1.72 lakh. We can contrast this with the fact that in the last five years, more than 1.25 crore cars have been sold, and number of Indian citizens who flew abroad, either for business or tourism, is 2 crore in the year 2015. From all these figures we can conclude that we are largely a tax non-compliant society. The predominance of cash in the economy makes it possible for the people to evade their taxes. When too many people evade taxes, the burden of their share falls on those who are honest and compliant. \n142. After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture. During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs 5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs 3.31 crores. \nThis data mining will help us immensely in expanding the tax net as well as increasing the revenues, which was one of the objectives of demonetisation. \n143. Madam Speaker, one of the main priorities of our Government is to eliminate the black money component from the economy. We are committed to make our taxation rates more reasonable, our tax administration more fair and expand the tax base in the country. This approach will change the colour of money. \nNayi Duniya hai naya daur hai, nayi hai umang \nKuch thhey pehle ke tarikey, toh hai kuch aaj ke dhang \nRoshni aake andhere se jo takrayi hai \nKaaley dhan ko bhi badalna paada, aaj apna rang \n144. The net tax revenue of 2013-14 was Rs 11.38 lakh crores. This grew by 9.4% in 2014-15 and 17% in 2015-16. As per the RE of 2016-17, we will end the year with a high growth rate of 17% for the second year in a row. Because of the serious efforts made by the Government, the rate of growth of advance tax in personal income tax in the first three quarters of the current financial is 34.8%. \n145. Madam Speaker, the thrust of my tax proposals in this Budget is stimulating growth, relief to middle class, affordable housing, curbing black money, promoting digital economy, transparency of political funding and simplification of tax administration. \nMeasures for Promoting Affordable Housing and Real Estate Sector \n146. In my budget proposals last year, I had announced a scheme for profit-linked income tax exemption for promoters of affordable housing scheme which has received a very good response. However, in order to make this scheme more attractive, I propose certain changes in the scheme. First of all, instead of built up area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr., the carpet area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr. will be counted. Also the 30 sq.mtr. limit will apply only in case of municipal limits of 4 metropolitan cities while for the rest of the country including in the peripheral areas of metros, limit of 60 sq.mtr. will apply. In order to be eligible, the scheme was to be completed in 3 years after commencement. I propose to extend this period to 5 years. \n147. At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting completion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income. For builders for whom constructed buildings are stock-in-trade, I propose to apply this rule only after one year of the end of the year in which completion certificate is received so that they get some breathing time for liquidating their inventory. \n148. We also propose to make a number of changes in the capital gain taxation provisions in respect of land and building. The holding period for considering gain from immovable property to be long term is 3 years now. This is proposed to be reduced to 2 years. Also, the base year for indexation is proposed to be shifted from 1.4.1981 to 1.4.2001 for all classes of assets including immovable property. This move will significantly reduce the capital gain tax liability while encouraging the mobility of assets. We also plan to extend the basket of financial instruments in which the capital gains can be invested without payment of tax. \n149. For Joint Development Agreement signed for development of property, the liability to pay capital gain tax will arise in the year the project is completed. \n150. The new capital for State of Andhra Pradesh is being constructed by innovative land-pooling mechanism without use of the Land Acquisition Act. I propose to exempt from capital gain tax, persons holding land on 2.6.2014, the date on which the State of Andhra Pradesh was reorganised, and whose land is being pooled for creation of capital city under the Government scheme. \nMeasures for Stimulating Growth \n151. A concessional with-holding rate of 5% is being charged on interest earned by foreign entities in external commercial borrowings or in bonds and Government securities. This concession is available till 30.6.2017. I propose to extend it to 30.6.2020. This benefit is also extended to Rupee Denominated (Masala) Bonds. \n152. The Government gave income tax exemptions to start-ups with certain conditions last year. For the purpose of carry forward of losses in respect of such start-ups, the condition of continuous holding of 51% of voting rights has been relaxed subject to the condition that the holding of the original promoter/promoters continues. Also the profit linked deduction available to the start-ups for 3 years out of 5 years is being changed to 3 years out of 7 years. \n153. Minimum Alternate Tax is at present levied as an advance tax. There is a strong demand for abolition of MAT. Although the plan for phasing out of exemptions will kick in from 1.4.2017, the full benefit of revenue out of phase-out will be available to Government only after 7 to 10 years when all those who are already availing exemptions at present complete their period of availment. Therefore, it is not practical to remove or reduce MAT at present. However, in order to allow companies to use MAT credit in future years, I propose to allow carry forward of MAT upto a period of 15 years instead of 10 years at present. \n154. In my Budget proposals in 2015, I had announced that I would be bringing the corporate income tax rate down to 25% gradually. In 2016 Budget, I had announced a reduction by 1% in case of those companies whose turnover is less than Rs 5 crore. In the same Budget, I had also announced that new manufacturing companies who do not avail of any exemption would be charged only 25% income tax. \n155. Medium and Small Enterprises occupy bulk of economic activities and are also instrumental in providing maximum employment to people. However, since they do not get many exemptions, they end up paying more taxes as compared to large companies. As per data of financial year 2015-16, 2.85 lakh companies making profit of less than Rs 1 crore pay effective tax rate of 30.26% while 298 companies making profit above Rs 500 crores pay effective tax rate of 25.90%. \n156. In order to make MSME companies more viable and also to encourage firms to migrate to company format, I propose to reduce the income tax for smaller companies with annual turnover upto Rs 50 crore to 25%. As per data of Assessment Year 2015-16, there are 6.94 lakh companies filing returns of which 6.67 lakh companies fall in this category and, therefore, percentage-wise 96% of companies will get this benefit of lower taxation. This will make our MSME sector more competitive as compared to large companies. The revenue forgone estimate for this measure is expected to be Rs 7,200 crore per annum. \n157. In order to give a boost to banking sector, I propose to increase allowable provision for Non-Performing Asset from 7.5% to 8.5%. This will reduce the tax liability of banks. I also propose to tax interest receivable on actual receipt instead of accrual basis in respect of NPA accounts of all non-scheduled cooperative banks also at par with scheduled banks. This will remove hardship of having to pay tax even when interest income is not realised. \n158. Considering the wide range of use of LNG as fuel as well as feed stock for petro-chemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on LNG from 5% to 2.5%. \n159. In order to incentivise domestic value addition and to promote Make in India, I propose to make changes in Customs & Central Excise duties in respect of certain items which are given in the Annex III of this speech. Some of these proposals are also for addressing duty inversion. \nPromoting Digital Economy \n160. There is a scheme of presumptive income tax for small and medium tax payers whose turnover is upto Rs 2 crores. At present, 8% of their turnover is counted as presumptive income. I propose to make this 6% in respect of turnover which is received by non-cash means. This benefit will be applicable for transactions undertaken in the current year also. \n161. I propose to limit the cash expenditure allowable as deduction, both for revenue as well as capital expenditure, to Rs 10,000. Similarly, the limit of cash donation which can be received by a charitable trust is being reduced from Rs 10,000/- to Rs 2000/-. \n162. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Government for black money has suggested that no transaction above Rs 3 lakh should be permitted in cash. The Government has decided to accept this proposal. Suitable amendment to the Income-tax Act is proposed in the Finance Bill for enforcing this decision. \n163. To promote cashless transactions, I propose to exempt BCD, Excise/CV duty and SAD on miniaturised POS card reader for m-POS, micro ATM standards version 1.5.1, Finger Print Readers/Scanners and Iris Scanners. Simultaneously, I also propose to exempt parts and components for manufacture of such devices, so as to encourage domestic manufacturing of these devices. \nTransparency in Electoral Funding \n164. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy. Political parties are an essential ingredient of a multi-party Parliamentary democracy. Even 70 years after Independence, the country has not been able to evolve a transparent method of funding political parties which is vital to the system of free and fair elections. An attempt was made in the past by amending the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, the Companies Act and the Income Tax Act to incentivise donations by individuals, partnership firms, HUFs and companies to political parties. Both the donor and the donee were granted exemption from payment of tax if the accounts were transparently maintained and returns were filed with the competent authorities. Additionally, a list of donors who contributed more than Rs 20,000/- to any party in cash or cheque is required to be maintained. The situation has only marginally improved since these provisions were brought into force. Political parties continue to receive most of their funds through anonymous donations which are shown in cash. \n165. An effort, therefore, requires to be made to cleanse the system of political funding in India. Donors have also expressed reluctance in donating by cheque or other transparent methods as it would disclose their identity and entail adverse consequences. I, therefore, propose the following scheme as an effort to cleanse the system of funding of political parties: \na) In accordance with the suggestion made by the Election Commission, the maximum amount of cash donation that a political party can receive will be Rs 2000/- from one person. \nb) Political parties will be entitled to receive donations by cheque or digital mode from their donors. \nc) As an additional step, an amendment is being proposed to the Reserve Bank of India Act to enable the issuance of electoral bonds in accordance with a scheme that the Government of India would frame in this regard. Under this scheme, a donor could purchase bonds from authorised banks against cheque and digital payments only. They shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party. These bonds will be redeemable within the prescribed time limit from issuance of bond. \nd) Every political party would have to file its return within the time prescribed in accordance with the provision of the Income-tax Act. \nNeedless to say that the existing exemption to the political parties from payment of income-tax would be available only subject to the fulfilment of these conditions. This reform will bring about greater transparency and accountability in political funding, while preventing future generation of black money. \nEase of Doing Business \n166. As an anti-avoidance measure, the provision of domestic transfer pricing in respect of related entities was brought in the Finance Act of 2012. Since then the number of entities being covered under domestic pricing has gone up substantially necessitating a longer scrutiny, which causes hardship to domestic companies. In order to reduce the compliance burden due to domestic transfer pricing provisions, I propose to restrict the scope of domestic transfer pricing only if one of the entities involved in related party transaction enjoys specified profit-linked deduction. \n167. I propose to increase the threshold limit for audit of business entities who opt for presumptive income scheme from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crores. Similarly, the threshold for maintenance of books for individuals and HUF is being increased from turnover of Rs 10 lakhs to Rs 25 lakhs or income from Rs 1.2 lakhs to Rs 2.5 lakhs. \n168. In 2012, Income-tax Act was amended to provide for taxation of those transactions of transfer of shares or interest in a foreign entity deriving its value substantially from Indian assets. Apprehensions have been raised about some difficulties which arise because of this provision in case of transfer of stake of investors of India-based funds located abroad but investing in India-based companies. \n169. In order to remove this difficulty, I propose to exempt Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Category I & II from indirect transfer provision. I also propose to issue a clarification that indirect transfer provision shall not apply in case of redemption of shares or interests outside India as a result of or arising out of redemption or sale of investment in India which is chargeable to tax in India. \n170. As on today, a TDS of 5% is being deducted from commission payable to individual insurance agents even if the income of some of them may be below taxable limit. I propose to exempt them from the requirement of TDS subject to their filing a self-declaration that their income is below taxable limit. \n171. Last year, I had announced a new scheme for presumptive taxation for professionals with receipt upto Rs 50 lakhs p.a. In respect of such assesses, they are being given further benefit in terms of paying advance tax in one instalment instead of four. \n172. In order to allow the people to claim the refund expeditiously, the time period for revising a tax return is being reduced to 12 months from completion of financial year, at par with the time period for filing of return. Also the time for completion of scrutiny assessments is being compressed further from 21 months to 18 months for Assessment Year 2018-19 and further to 12 months for Assessment Year 2019-20 and thereafter. \nPersonal Income-Tax \n173. While the Government is trying to bring within tax-net more people who are evading taxes, the present burden of taxation is mainly on honest tax payers and salaried employees who are showing their income correctly. Therefore, post-demonetisation, there is a legitimate expectation of this class of people to reduce their burden of taxation. Also an argument is made that if a nominal rate of taxation is kept for lower slab, many more people will prefer to come within the tax net. \n174. I, therefore, propose to reduce the existing rate of taxation for individual assesses between income of Rs 2.5 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs to 5% from the present rate of 10%. This would reduce the tax liability of all persons below Rs 5 lakh income either to zero (with rebate) or 50% of their existing liability. In order not to have duplication of benefit, the existing benefit of rebate available to the same group of beneficiaries is being reduced to Rs 2500 available only to assessees upto income of Rs 3.5 lakhs. The combined effect of both these measures will mean that there would be zero tax liability for people getting income upto Rs 3 lakhs p.a. and the tax liability will only be Rs 2,500 for people with income between Rs 3 and Rs 3.5 lakhs. If the limit of Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C for investment is used fully the tax would be zero for people with income of Rs 4.5 lakhs. While the taxation liability of people with income upto Rs 5 lakhs is being reduced to half, all the other categories of tax payers in the subsequent slabs will also get a uniform benefit of Rs 12,500/- per person. The total amount of tax foregone on account of this measure is Rs 15,500 crores. \n175. In order to make good some of this revenue loss on account of this relief, I propose to levy a surcharge of 10% of tax payable on categories of individuals whose annual taxable income is between Rs 50 lakhs and Rs 1 crore. The existing surcharge of 15% of Tax on people earning more than Rs 1 crore will continue. This is likely to give additional revenue of Rs 2,700 crores. \n176. In order to expand tax net, I also plan to have a simple one-page form to be filed as Income Tax Return for the category of individuals having taxable income upto Rs 5 lakhs other than business income. Also a person of this category who files income tax return for the first time would not be subjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information available with the Department regarding his high value transaction. I appeal to all citizens of India to contribute to Nation Building by making a small payment of 5% tax if their income is falling in the lowest slab of Rs 2.5 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs. \n177. Some other important proposals for amendment in Tax Laws which are not covered by me in my speech are given in Annex III of this speech. \nGoods and Services Tax \n178. There has been substantial progress towards ushering in GST, by far, the biggest tax reform since independence. Since the enactment of the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, the preparatory work for this path-breaking reform has been a top priority for the Government. In this context, several teams of officers both from the States and Central Board of Excise and Customs have been working tirelessly to give finishing touch to the Model GST law and rules and other details. Government on its part has promptly given effect to various provisions of the Constitutional Amendment Act, including constitution of the GST Council. Since then, the GST Council held 9 meetings to discuss various issues relating to GST, including broad contours of the GST rate structure, threshold exemption and parameters for composition scheme, details for compensation to States due to implementation of GST, examination of draft model GST law, draft IGST law and the Compensation Law and administrative mechanism for GST. It is my privilege to inform this august house that the GST Council has finalised its recommendations on almost all the issues based on consensus and after spirited debate and discussions. The preparation of IT system for GST is also on schedule. The extensive reach-out efforts to trade and industry for GST will start from 1st April, 2017 to make them aware of the new taxation system. \n179. Centre, through the Central Board of Excise & Customs, shall continue to strive to achieve the goal of implementation of GST as per schedule without compromising the spirit of co-operative federalism. Implementation of GST is likely to bring more taxes both to Central and State Governments because of widening of tax net. I have preferred not to make many changes in current regime of Excise & Service Tax because the same are to be replaced by GST soon. \nRAPID \n180. In the Annual Conclave of Tax officers called \u2018Rajaswa Gyan Sangam\u2019 held in June 2016, the Prime Minister had expressed his desire to bring reforms in tax administration in the form of an approach of RAPID which stands for Revenue, Accountability, Probity, Information and Digitisation. This approach precisely reflects the strategy of Tax Department which is now formulated. While revenue considerations always remain the focus of Revenue Department, we are trying to bring in maximum use of Information Technology to remove human contact with assesses as well as to plug tax avoidance. We will try to maximise our efforts for e-assessment in the coming year. We are also using a lot of data mining capability, both in-house and outsourced. We plan to enforce greater accountability of officers of Tax Department for specific act of commission and omission. I would like to assure everyone that honest, tax-compliant person would be treated with dignity and courtesy. \n181. Madam Speaker, my direct tax proposals for exemptions, etc. would result in revenue loss of Rs 22,700 crore but after counting for revenue gain of Rs 2,700 crore for additional resource mobilisation proposal, the net revenue loss in direct tax would come to Rs 20,000 crore. There is no significant loss or gain in my indirect tax proposals. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n182. Madam Speaker, I have outlined the Budget proposals under our overarching agenda: \u201cTransform, Energise and Clean India\u201d. Our emphasis will now be on implementing all these proposals for the benefit of the farmers, the poor and the underprivileged sections of our society. \n183. Madam Speaker, it is said: \u201cWhen my aim is right, when my goal is in sight, the winds favour me and I fly\u201d. There is no other day, which is more appropriate for this, than today. \n184. With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the House. First Published: Wednesday, February 1, 2017 - 14:51 ",

                              "text": "Madam Speaker, \n\nOn this auspicious day of Vasant Panchami, I rise to present the Budget for 2017-18. Spring is a season of optimism. I extend my warm greetings to everyone on this occasion. \n\n2. Madam Speaker, our Government was elected amidst huge expectations of the people. The underlying theme of countless expectations was good governance. The expectations included burning issues like inflation and price rise, corruption in day to day transactions and crony capitalism. There was also expectation for a major change in the way the country\u2019s natural resources were allocated, processed and deployed. \n\n3. In the last two and half years, it has been our mission to bring a Transformative Shift in the way our country is governed. We have moved \n\na. from a discretionary administration to a policy and system based administration; \nb. from favouritism to transparency and objectivity in decision making; \nc. from blanket and loose entitlements to targeted delivery; and \nd. from informal economy to formal economy \n\nInflation, which was in double digits, has been controlled; sluggish growth has been replaced by high growth; and a massive war against black money has been launched. We have worked tirelessly on all these fronts and feel encouraged by the unstinted support of the people to our initiatives. The Government is now seen as a trusted custodian of public money. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the people of India for their strong support. \n\n4. We shall continue to undertake many more measures to ensure that the fruits of growth reach the farmers, the workers, the poor, the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, women and other vulnerable sections of our society. Our focus will be on energising our youth to reap the benefits of growth and employment. \n\n5. Madam Speaker, I am presenting this Budget when the world economy faces considerable uncertainty, in the aftermath of major economic and political developments during the last one year. Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that world GDP will grow by 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017. The advanced economies are expected to increase their growth from 1.6% to 1.9% and the emerging economies from 4.1% to 4.5%. As per current indications, macro-economic policy is expected to be more expansionary in certain large economies. Growth in a number of emerging economies is expected to recover in 2017, after relatively poor performance in 2016. These are positive signs and point to an optimistic outlook for the next year. \n\n6. There are, however, three major challenges for emerging economies. First, the current monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve, to increase the policy rates more than once in 2017, may lead to lower capital inflows and higher outflows from the emerging economies. Second, the uncertainty around commodity prices, especially that of crude oil, has implications for the fiscal situation of emerging economies. It is however expected that increase, if any, in oil prices would get tempered by quick response from producers of shale gas and oil. This would have a sobering impact on prices of crude and petroleum. Third, in several parts of the world, there are signs of increasing retreat from globalisation of goods, services and people, as pressures for protectionism are building up. These developments have the potential to affect exports from a number of emerging markets, including India. \n\n7. Amidst all these developments, India stands out as a bright spot in the world economic landscape. India\u2019s macro-economic stability continues to be the foundation of economic success. CPI inflation declined from 6% in July 2016 to 3.4% in December, 2016 and is expected to remain within RBI\u2019s mandated range of 2% to 6%. Favourable price developments reflect prudent macro-economic management, resulting in higher agricultural production, especially in pulses. India's Current Account Deficit declined from about 1% of GDP last year to 0.3% of GDP in the first half of 2016-17. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) increased from Rs 1,07,000 crores in the first half of last year to Rs 1,45,000 crores in the first half of 2016-17. This marks an increase by 36%, despite 5% reduction in global FDI inflows. Foreign exchange reserves have reached 361 billion US Dollars as on 20th January, 2017, which represents a comfortable cover for about 12 months of imports. \n\n8. The Government has also continued on the steady path of fiscal consolidation, without compromising on the public investment requirements of the economy. Externally, the economy successfully weathered a number of shocks, the redemption of FCNR deposits, volatility from the US elections and the Fed rate hike. According to IMF forecast, India is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in 2017. \n\n9. A number of global reports and assessments, over the last two years, have shown that India has considerably improved its policies, practices and economic profile. These are reflected in Doing Business Report of the World Bank; World Investment Report 2016 of UNCTAD; Global Competitiveness Report of 2015-16 and 2016-17 of the World Economic Forum; and several other Reports. India has become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth previously. We are seen as an engine of global growth. \n\n10. In the last one year, our country has witnessed historic and impactful economic reforms and policy making. In fact, India was one of the very few economies undertaking transformational reforms. There were two tectonic policy initiatives, namely, passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill for GST and the progress for its implementation; and demonetisation of high denomination bank notes. The advantages of GST for our economy in terms of spurring growth, competitiveness, indirect tax simplification and greater transparency have already been extensively discussed in both Houses of Parliament. I thank all Members of both the Houses for having passed the Constitution Amendment unanimously. I also thank the State Governments for resolving all relevant issues in the GST Council. \n\n11. Demonetisation of high denomination bank notes was in continuation of a series of measures taken by our Government during the last two years. It is a bold and decisive measure. For several decades, tax evasion for many has become a way of life. This compromises the larger public interest and creates unjust enrichment in favour of the tax evader, to the detriment of the poor and deprived. This has bred a parallel economy which is unacceptable for an inclusive society. Demonetisation seeks to create a new \u2018normal\u2019 wherein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real. This exercise is part of our Government\u2019s resolve to eliminate corruption, black money, counterfeit currency and terror funding. Like all reforms, this measure is obviously disruptive, as it seeks to change the retrograde status quo. Drop in economic activity, if any, on account of the currency squeeze during the remonetisation period is expected to have only a transient impact on the economy. I am reminded here of what the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, had said: \"A right cause never fails\". \n\n12. Demonetisation has strong potential to generate long-term benefits in terms of reduced corruption, greater digitisation of the economy, increased flow of financial savings and greater formalisation of the economy, all of which would eventually lead to higher GDP growth and tax revenues. Demonetisation helps to transfer resources from the tax evaders to the Government, which can use these resources for the welfare of the poor and the deprived. There is early evidence of an increased capacity of Banks to lend at reduced interest rates and a huge shift towards digitisation among all sections of society. We firmly believe that demonetisation and GST which were built on the third transformational achievement of our Government, namely, the JAM vision, will have an epoch making impact on our economy and the lives of our people. \n\n13. Madam Speaker, we are at an important turning point in the path of our growth and development. \n\nIss mod pe ghabra ke na tham jaiye aap \nJo baat nayi hai usse apnaiye aap \nDarte hain nayi raah pe kyun chalne se \nHum aage-aage chalte hain aazmaiye aap \n\n14. The pace of remonetisation has picked up and will soon reach comfortable levels. The effects of demonetisation are not expected to spill over into the next year. Thus IMF, even while revising India\u2019s GDP forecast for 2016 downwards, has projected a GDP growth of 7.2% and 7.7% in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The World Bank, however, is more optimistic and has projected a GDP growth of 7% in 2016-17, 7.6% in 2017-18 and 7.8% in 2018-19. This pick up in our economy is premised upon our policy and determination to continue with economic reforms; increase in public investment in infrastructure and development projects; and export growth in the context of the expected rebound in world economy. The surplus liquidity in the banking system, created by demonetisation, will lower borrowing costs and increase the access to credit. This will boost economic activity, with multiplier effects. \n\n15. The announcements made by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st December, 2016 address many of the key concerns of our economy at this juncture, such as, housing for the poor; relief to farmers; credit support to MSMEs; encouragement to digital transactions; assistance to pregnant women and senior citizens; and priority to dalits, tribals, backward classes and women under the Mudra Yojana. \n\n16. My overall approach, while preparing this Budget, has been to spend more in rural areas, infrastructure and poverty alleviation and yet maintain the best standards of fiscal prudence. I have also kept in mind the need to continue with economic reforms, promote higher investments and accelerate growth. \n\n17. The last one year was a witness to other major reforms, namely, enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; amendment to the RBI Act for inflation targeting; enactment of the Aadhar bill for disbursement of financial subsidies and benefits; significant reforms in FDI policy; the job creating package for textile sector; and several other measures. We will continue the process of economic reforms for the benefit of the poor and the underprivileged. \n\n18. Madam Speaker, the Budget for 2017-18 contains three major reforms. First, the presentation of the Budget has been advanced to 1st February to enable the Parliament to avoid a Vote on Account and pass a single Appropriation Bill for 2017-18, before the close of the current financial year. This would enable the Ministries and Departments to operationalise all schemes and projects, including the new schemes, right from the commencement of the next financial year. They would be able to fully utilise the available working season before the onset of the monsoon. Second, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget is a historic step. We have discontinued the colonial practice prevalent since 1924. This decision brings the Railways to the centre stage of Government\u2019s fiscal policy and would facilitate multi modal transport planning between railways, highways and inland waterways. The functional autonomy of Railways will, however, continue. Third, we have done away with the plan and non-plan classification of expenditure. This will give us a holistic view of allocations for sectors and ministries. This would facilitate optimal allocation of resources. \n\n19. Madam Speaker, we are aware that we need to do more for our people. Continuing with the task of fulfilling the people\u2019s expectations, our agenda for the next year is : \"Transform, Energise and Clean India\", that is, TEC India. This agenda of TEC India seeks to \n\na. Transform the quality of governance and quality of life of our people; \nb. Energise various sections of society, especially the youth and the vulnerable, and enable them to unleash their true potential; and \nc. Clean the country from the evils of corruption, black money and non-transparent political funding \n\nI propose to present my Budget proposals under ten distinct themes to foster this broad agenda. The themes are : \n\n1. Farmers: for whom we have committed to double the income in 5 years; \n2. Rural Population: providing employment and basic infrastructure; \n3. Youth: energising them through education, skills and jobs; \n4. Poor and the Underprivileged: strengthening the systems of social security, health care and affordable housing; \n5. Infrastructure: for efficiency, productivity and quality of life; \n6. Financial Sector: growth and stability through stronger institutions; \n7. Digital Economy: for speed, accountability and transparency; \n8. Public Service: effective governance and efficient service delivery through people\u2019s participation; \n9. Prudent Fiscal Management: to ensure optimal deployment of resources and preserve fiscal stability; and \n10. Tax Administration: honouring the honest \n\nFARMERS \n\n20. The Indian farmer has once again shown his commitment and resilience in the current year. The total area sown under kharif and rabi seasons are higher than the previous year. With a better monsoon, agriculture is expected to grow at 4.1% in the current year. 21. In last year\u2019s Budget speech, I focused on 'income security' of farmers to double their income in 5 years. I had also announced a number of measures. We have to take more steps and enable the farmers to increase their production and productivity; and to deal with post-harvest challenges. \n\n22. For a good crop, adequate credit should be available to farmers in time. The target for agricultural credit in 2017-18 has been fixed at a record level of Rs 10 lakh crores. We will take special efforts to ensure adequate flow of credit to the under serviced areas, the Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir. The farmers will also benefit from 60 days' interest waiver announced by Honourable Prime Minister in respect of their loans from the cooperative credit structure. \n\n23. About 40% of the small and marginal farmers avail credit from the cooperative structure. The Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) act as the front end for loan disbursements. We will support NABARD for computerisation and integration of all 63,000 functional PACS with the Core Banking System of District Central Cooperative Banks. This will be done in 3 years at an estimated cost of Rs 1,900 crores, with financial participation from State Governments. This will ensure seamless flow of credit to small and marginal farmers. \n\n24. At the time of sowing, farmers should feel secure against natural calamities. The Fasal Bima Yojana launched by our Government is a major step in this direction. The coverage of this scheme will be increased from 30% of cropped area in 2016-17 to 40% in 2017-18 and 50% in 2018-19. The Budget provision of Rs 5,500 crores for this Yojana in BE 2016-17 was increased to Rs 13,240 crores in RE 2016-17 to settle the arrear claims. For 2017-18, I have provided a sum of Rs 9,000 crores. The sum insured under this Yojana has more than doubled from Rs 69,000 crores in Kharif 2015 to Rs 1,41,625 crores in Kharif 2016. \n\n25. Issuance of Soil Health Cards has gathered momentum. The real benefit to farmers would be available only when the soil samples are tested quickly and nutrient level of the soil is known. Government will therefore set up new mini labs in Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and ensure 100% coverage of all 648 KVKs in the country. In addition, 1000 mini labs will be set up by qualified local entrepreneurs. Government will provide credit linked subsidy to these entrepreneurs. \n\n26. A Long Term Irrigation Fund has already been set up in NABARD. Honourable Prime Minister has announced an addition of Rs 20,000 crores to its corpus. This will take the total corpus of this Fund to Rs 40,000 crores. \n\n27. A dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund will be set up in NABARD to achieve the goal, 'per drop more crop'. The Fund will have an initial corpus of Rs 5,000 crores. \n\n28. For the post-harvest phase, we will take steps to enable farmers to get better prices for their produce in the markets. The coverage of National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) will be expanded from the current 250 markets to 585 APMCs. Assistance up to a ceiling of Rs 75 lakhs will be provided to every e-NAM market for establishment of cleaning, grading and packaging facilities. This will lead to value addition of farmers\u2019 produce. \n\n29. Market reforms will be undertaken and the States would be urged to denotify perishables from APMC. This will give opportunity to farmers to sell their produce and get better prices. \n\n30. We also propose to integrate farmers who grow fruits and vegetables with agro processing units for better price realisation and reduction of post-harvest losses. A model law on contract farming would therefore be prepared and circulated among the States for adoption. \n\n31. Dairy is an important source of additional income for the farmers. Availability of milk processing facility and other infrastructure will benefit the farmers through value addition. A large number of milk processing units set up under the Operation Flood Programme has since become old and obsolete. A Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund would be set up in NABARD with a corpus of Rs 8,000 crores over 3 years. Initially, the Fund will start with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crores. \n\nRURAL POPULATION \n\n32. I now turn to the Rural Sector, which was so dear to the heart of Mahatma Gandhi. \n\n33. Over Rs 3 lakh crores are spent in rural areas every year, if we add up all the programmes meant for rural poor from the Central Budget, State Budgets, Bank linkage for self-help groups, etc. With a clear focus on improving accountability, outcomes and convergence, we will undertake a Mission Antyodaya to bring one crore households out of poverty and to make 50,000 gram panchayats poverty free by 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji. We will utilise the existing resources more effectively along with annual increases. This mission will work with a focused micro plan for sustainable livelihood for every deprived household. A composite index for poverty free gram panchayats would be developed to monitor the progress from the baseline. \n\n34. Our Government has made a conscious effort to reorient MGNREGA to support our resolve to double farmers\u2019 income. While providing at least 100 days employment to every rural household, MGNREGA should create productive assets to improve farm productivity and incomes. The target of 5 lakh farm ponds and 10 lakh compost pits announced in the last Budget from MGNREGA funds will be fully achieved. In fact, against 5 lakh farm ponds, it is expected that about 10 lakh farm ponds would be completed by March 2017. During 2017-18, another 5 lakh farm ponds will be taken up. This single measure will contribute greatly to drought proofing of gram panchayats. \n\n35. Participation of women in MGNREGA has increased to 55% from less than 48% in the past. \n\n36. Honourable Members would be happy to note that the budget provision of Rs 38,500 crores under MGNREGA in 2016-17 has been increased to Rs 48,000 crores in 2017-18. This is the highest ever allocation for MGNREGA. The initiative to geo-tag all MGNREGA assets and putting them in public domain has established greater transparency. We are also using space technology in a big way to plan MGNREGA works. \n\n37. The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is now being implemented as never before. The pace of construction of PMGSY roads has accelerated to reach 133 km roads per day in 2016-17, as against an average of 73 km during the period 2011-2014. We have also taken up the task of connecting habitations with more than 100 persons in left wing extremism affected Blocks. We have committed to complete the current target under PMGSY by 2019. I have provided a sum of Rs 19,000 crores in 2017-18 for this scheme. Together with the contribution of States, an amount of Rs 27,000 crores will be spent on PMGSY in 2017-18. \n\n38. We propose to complete 1 crore houses by 2019 for the houseless and those living in kutcha houses. I have stepped up the allocation for Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana \u2013 Gramin from Rs 15,000 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 23,000 crores in 2017-18. \n\n39. We are well on our way to achieving 100% village electrification by 1st May 2018. An increased allocation of Rs 4,814 crores has been proposed under the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana in 2017-18. \n\n40. I have also proposed to increase the allocations for Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission for promotion of skill development and livelihood opportunities for people in rural areas to Rs 4,500 in 2017-18. The allocation for Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) and credit support schemes has been increased more than 3 times. \n\n41. Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) has made tremendous progress in promoting safe sanitation and ending open defecation. Sanitation coverage in rural India has gone up from 42% in October 2014 to about 60%. Open Defecation Free villages are now being given priority for piped water supply. \n\n42. We propose to provide safe drinking water to over 28,000 arsenic and fluoride affected habitations in the next four years. This will be a sub mission of the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). \n\n43. For imparting new skills to the people in the rural areas, mason training will be provided to 5 lakh persons by 2022, with an immediate target of training at least 20,000 persons by 2017-18. \n\n44. Panchayati raj institutions still lack human resources for implementing development programmes. A programme of \"human resource reforms for results\" will be launched during 2017-18 for this purpose. \n\n45. The Government will continue to work closely with the farmers and the people in the rural areas to improve their life and environment. This is a non-negotiable agenda for our Government. The total allocation for the rural, agriculture and allied sectors in 2017-18 is ` 1,87,223 crores, which is 24% higher than the previous year. \n\nYOUTH \n\n46. Let me now focus on my proposals for the youth. \n\n47. Quality education will energise our youth. In the words of Swami Vivekananda, \"The education which does not help the common mass of people to equip themselves for the struggle for life... is it worth the name?\" \n\n48. We have proposed to introduce a system of measuring annual learning outcomes in our schools. Emphasis will be given on science education and flexibility in curriculum to promote creativity through local innovative content. \n\n49. An Innovation Fund for Secondary Education will be created to encourage local innovation for ensuring universal access, gender parity and quality improvement. This will include ICT enabled learning transformation. The focus will be on 3479 educationally backward blocks. \n\n50. In higher education, we will undertake reforms in the UGC. Good quality institutions would be enabled to have greater administrative and academic autonomy. Colleges will be identified based on accreditation and ranking, and given autonomous status. A revised framework will be put in place for outcome based accreditation and credit based programmes. \n\n51. We propose to leverage information technology and launch SWAYAM platform with at least 350 online courses. This would enable students to virtually attend the courses taught by the best faculty; access high quality reading resources; participate in discussion forums; take tests and earn academic grades. Access to SWAYAM would be widened by linkage with DTH channels, dedicated to education. \n\n52. We propose to establish a National Testing Agency as an autonomous and self-sustained premier testing organisation to conduct all entrance examinations for higher education institutions. This would free CBSE, AICTE and other premier institutions from these administrative responsibilities so that they can focus more on academics. \n\n53. We have a huge demographic advantage. Skill India mission was launched in July 2015 to maximise the potential of our youth. \n\n54. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKK) have already been promoted in more than 60 districts. We now propose to extend these Kendras to more than 600 districts across the country. 100 India International Skills Centres will be established across the country. These Centres would offer advanced training and also courses in foreign languages. This will help those of our youth who seek job opportunities outside the country. \n\n55. In 2017-18, we also propose to launch the Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion programme (SANKALP) at a cost of Rs 4,000 crores. SANKALP will provide market relevant training to 3.5 crore youth. \n\n56. The next phase of Skill Strengthening for Industrial Value Enhancement (STRIVE) will also be launched in 2017-18 at a cost of Rs 2,200 crores. STRIVE will focus on improving the quality and market relevance of vocational training provided in ITIs and strengthen the apprenticeship programmes through industry cluster approach. \n\n57. A special scheme for creating employment in the textile sector has already been launched. A similar scheme will be implemented for the leather and footwear industries. \n\n58. Tourism is a big employment generator and has a multiplier impact on the economy. Five Special Tourism Zones, anchored on SPVs, will be set up in partnership with the States. Incredible India 2.0 Campaign will be launched across the world. \n\nTHE POOR AND THE UNDERPRIVILEGED \n\n59. Madam Speaker, I now turn to my proposals for the poor and the underprivileged. \n\n60. Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas begins with the girl child and women. Mahila Shakti Kendra will be set up at village level with an allocation of Rs 500 crores in 14 lakh ICDS Anganwadi Centres. This will provide one stop convergent support services for empowering rural women with opportunities for skill development, employment, digital literacy, health and nutrition. A nationwide scheme for financial assistance to pregnant women has already been announced by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st December, 2016. Under this scheme, Rs 6,000 each will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children. \n\n61. For the welfare of Women and Children under various schemes across all Ministries, I have stepped up the allocation from Rs 1,56,528 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 1,84,632 crores in 2017-18. \n\n62. We propose to facilitate higher investment in affordable housing. Affordable housing will now be given infrastructure status, which will enable these projects to avail the associated benefits. \n\n63. The National Housing Bank will refinance individual housing loans of about Rs 20,000 crore in 2017-18. Thanks to the surplus liquidity created by demonetisation, the Banks have already started reducing their lending rates, including those for housing. In addition, interest subvention for housing loans has also been announced by the Honourable Prime Minister. \n\n64. Poverty is usually associated with poor health. It is the poor who suffer the maximum from various chronic diseases. Government has therefore prepared an action plan to eliminate Kala-Azar and Filariasis by 2017, Leprosy by 2018 and Measles by 2020. Elimination of tuberculosis by 2025 is also targeted. Similarly, action plan has been prepared to reduce IMR from 39 in 2014 to 28 by 2019 and MMR from 167 in 2011-13 to 100 by 2018-2020. 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres will be transformed into Health and Wellness Centres. \n\n65. We need to ensure adequate availability of specialist doctors to strengthen Secondary and Tertiary levels of health care. We have therefore decided to take steps to create additional 5,000 Post Graduate seats per annum. In addition, steps will be taken to roll out DNB courses in big District Hospitals; strengthen PG teaching in select ESI and Municipal Corporation Hospitals; and encourage reputed Private Hospitals to start DNB courses. We will work with the State Governments to take these tasks forward. The Government is committed to take necessary steps for structural transformation of the Regulatory framework of Medical Education and Practice in India. \n\n66. Two new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences will be set up in the States of Jharkhand and Gujarat. \n\n67. We propose to amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to ensure availability of drugs at reasonable prices and promote use of generic medicines. New rules for regulating medical devices will also be formulated. These rules will be internationally harmonised and attract investment into this sector. This will reduce the cost of such devices. \n\n68. We are keen on fostering a conducive labour environment wherein labour rights are protected and harmonious labour relations lead to higher productivity. Legislative reforms will be undertaken to simplify, rationalise and amalgamate the existing labour laws into 4 Codes on (i) wages; (ii) industrial relations; (iii) social security and welfare; and (iv) safety and working conditions. The Model Shops and Establishment Bill 2016 has been circulated to all States for consideration and adoption. This would open up additional avenues for employment of women. The amendment made to the Payment of Wages Act, is another initiative of our Government for the benefit of the labour and ease of doing business. \n\n69. Our Government is giving special importance to implementation of the schemes for welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities. The allocation for the welfare of Scheduled Castes has been stepped up from Rs 38,833 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 52,393 crores in 2017-18, representing an increase of about 35%. The allocation for Scheduled Tribes has been increased to Rs 31,920 crores and for Minority Affairs to Rs 4,195 crores. The Government will introduce outcome based monitoring of expenditure in these sectors by the NITI Aayog. \n\n70. For senior citizens, Aadhar based Smart Cards containing their health details will be introduced. A beginning will be made through a pilot in 15 districts during 2017-18. The LIC will implement a scheme for senior citizens to provide assured pension, with a guaranteed return of 8% per annum for 10 years. \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE \n\n71. The fifth component of TEC India agenda is Infrastructure. \n\n72. Railways, roads and rivers are the lifeline of our country. I feel privileged to present the first combined Budget of independent India that includes the Railways also. We are now in a position to synergise the investments in railways, roads, waterways and civil aviation. For 2017-18, the total capital and development expenditure of Railways has been pegged at Rs 1,31,000 crores. This includes Rs 55,000 crores provided by the Government. \n\n73. Among other things, the Railways will focus on four major areas, namely: \n\n1. Passenger safety; \n2. Capital and development works; \n3. Cleanliness; and \n4. Finance and accounting reforms. \n\n74. For passenger safety, a Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh will be created with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crores over a period of 5 years. Besides seed capital from the Government, the Railways will arrange the balance resources from their own revenues and other sources. Government will lay down clear cut guidelines and timeline for implementing various safety works to be funded from this Kosh. Unmanned level crossings on Broad Gauge lines will be eliminated by 2020. Expert international assistance will be harnessed to improve safety preparedness and maintenance practices. \n\n75. In the next 3 years, the throughput is proposed to be enhanced by 10%. This will be done through modernisation and upgradation of identified corridors. Railway lines of 3,500 kms will be commissioned in 2017-18, as against 2,800 kms in 2016-17. Steps will be taken to launch dedicated trains for tourism and pilgrimage. \n\n76. Railways have set up joint ventures with 9 State Governments. 70 projects have been identified for construction and development. \n\n77. A beginning has been made with regard to station redevelopment. At least 25 stations are expected to be awarded during 2017-18 for station redevelopment. 500 stations will be made differently abled friendly by providing lifts and escalators. \n\n78. It is proposed to feed about 7,000 stations with solar power in the medium term. A beginning has already been made in 300 stations. Works will be taken up for 2,000 railway stations as part of 1000 MW solar mission. \n\n79. Our focus is on swachh rail. SMS based Clean My Coach Service has been started. It is now proposed to introduce 'Coach Mitra' facility, a single window interface, to register all coach related complaints and requirements. By 2019, all coaches of Indian Railways will be fitted with bio toilets. Pilot plants for environment friendly disposal of solid waste and conversion of biodegradable waste to energy are being set up at New Delhi and Jaipur railway stations. Five more such solid waste management plants are now being taken up. \n\n80. Today Indian Railways face stiff competition from other modes of transportation which are dominated by the private sector. Transformative measures have to be undertaken to make Indian Railways competitive to retain their position of pre-eminence. The following steps will therefore be taken: \n\na. Railways will implement end to end integrated transport solutions for select commodities through partnership with logistics players, who would provide both front and back end connectivity. Rolling stocks and practices will be customised to transport perishable goods, especially agricultural products. \nb. Railways will offer competitive ticket booking facility to the public at large. Service charge on e-tickets booked through IRCTC has been withdrawn. Cashless reservations have gone up from 58% to 68%. \nc. As part of accounting reforms, accrual based financial statements will be rolled out by March 2019. \n\n81. It will be our continuous endeavour to improve the Operating Ratio of the Railways. The tariffs of Railways would be fixed, taking into consideration costs, quality of service, social obligations and competition from other forms of transport. \n\n82. Metro rail is emerging as an important mode of urban transportation. A new Metro Rail Policy will be announced with focus on innovative models of implementation and financing, as well as standardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software. This will open up new job opportunities for our youth. \n\n83. A new Metro Rail Act will be enacted by rationalising the existing laws. This will facilitate greater private participation and investment in construction and operation. \n\n84. In the road sector, I have stepped up the Budget allocation for highways from Rs 57,976 crores in BE 2016-17 to Rs 64,900 crores in 2017-18. 2,000 kms of coastal connectivity roads have been identified for construction and development. This will facilitate better connectivity with ports and remote villages. The total length of roads, including those under PMGSY, built from 2014-15 till the current year is about 1,40,000 kms which is significantly higher than previous three years. \n\n85. An effective multi modal logistics and transport sector will make our economy more competitive. A specific programme for development of multi-modal logistics parks, together with multi modal transport facilities, will be drawn up and implemented. \n\n86. Select airports in Tier 2 cities will be taken up for operation and maintenance in the PPP mode. Airport Authority of India Act will be amended to enable effective monetisation of land assets. The resources, so raised, will be utilised for airport upgradation. \n\n87. For transportation sector as a whole, including rail, roads, shipping, I have provided Rs 2,41,387 crores in 2017-18. This magnitude of investment will spur a huge amount of economic activity across the country and create more job opportunities. \n\n88. Telecom sector is an important component of our infrastructure eco system. The recent spectrum auctions have removed spectrum scarcity in the country. This will give a major fillip to mobile broadband and Digital India for the benefit of people living in rural and remote areas. \n\n89. Under the BharatNet Project, OFC has been laid in 1,55,000 kms. I have stepped up the allocation for BharatNet Project to ` 10,000 crores in 2017-18. By the end of 2017-18, high speed broadband connectivity on optical fibre will be available in more than 1,50,000 gram panchayats, with wifi hot spots and access to digital services at low tariffs. A DigiGaon initiative will be launched to provide tele-medicine, education and skills through digital technology. \n\n90. For strengthening our Energy sector, Government has decided to set up Strategic Crude Oil Reserves. In the first phase, 3 such Reserves facilities have been set up. Now in the second phase, it is proposed to set up caverns at 2 more locations, namely, Chandikhole in Odisha and Bikaner in Rajasthan. This will take our strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 MMT. \n\n91. In solar energy, we now propose to take up the second phase of Solar Park development for additional 20,000 MW capacity. \n\n92. We are also creating an eco-system to make India a global hub for electronics manufacturing. Over 250 investment proposals for electronics manufacturing have been received in the last 2 years, totalling an investment of Rs 1.26 lakh crores. A number of global leaders and mobile manufacturers have set up production facilities in India. I have therefore exponentially increased the allocation for incentive schemes like M-SIPS and EDF to Rs 745 crores in 2017-18. This is an all-time high. \n\n93. We have to focus on our export infrastructure in a competitive world. A new and restructured Central scheme, namely, Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) will be launched in 2017-18. \n\n94. The total allocation for infrastructure development in 2017-18 stands at Rs 3,96,135 crores. \n\nFINANCIAL SECTOR \n\n95. I now turn to the Financial Sector. The focus of TEC India agenda in this sector is on building stable and stronger institutions. We will continue with our reform agenda with several new measures. \n\n96. Our Government has already undertaken substantive reforms in FDI policy in the last two years. More than 90% of the total FDI inflows are now through the automatic route. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has successfully implemented e-filing and online processing of FDI applications. We have now reached a stage where FIPB can be phased out. We have therefore decided to abolish the FIPB in 2017-18. A roadmap for the same will be announced in the next few months. In the meantime, further liberalisation of FDI policy is under consideration and necessary announcements will be made in due course. \n\n97. The Commodities markets require further reforms for the benefits of farmers. An expert committee will be constituted to study and promote creation of an operational and legal framework to integrate spot market and derivatives market for commodities trading. e-NAM would be an integral part of such framework. \n\n98. The draft bill to curtail the menace of illicit deposit schemes has been placed in the public domain and will be introduced shortly after its finalisation. There is an urgent need to protect the poor and gullible investors from another set of dubious schemes, operated by unscrupulous entities who exploit the regulatory gaps in the Multi State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002. We will amend this Act in consultation with various stakeholders, as part of our 'Clean India' agenda. \n\n99. The bill relating to resolution of financial firms will be introduced in the current Budget Session of Parliament. This will contribute to stability and resilience of our financial system. It will also protect the consumers of various financial institutions. Together with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a resolution mechanism for financial firms will ensure comprehensiveness of the resolution system in our country. \n\n100. I had stated in my last Budget speech that a Bill will be introduced to streamline institutional arrangements for resolution of disputes in infrastructure related construction contracts, PPP and public utility contracts. After extensive stakeholders\u2019 consultations, we have decided that the required mechanism would be instituted as part of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. An amendment Bill will be introduced in this regard. \n\n101. Cyber security is critical for safeguarding the integrity and stability of our financial sector. A Computer Emergency Response Team for our Financial Sector (CERT-Fin) will be established. This entity will work in close coordination with all financial sector regulators and other stakeholders. \n\n102. I have also proposed several other measures in the financial sector which are listed in Annex I . \n\n103. Listing of Public Sector enterprises will foster greater public accountability and unlock the true value of these companies. The Government will put in place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure time bound listing of identified CPSEs on stock exchanges. The disinvestment policy announced by me in the last budget will continue. \n\n104. The shares of Railway PSEs like IRCTC, IRFC and IRCON will be listed in stock exchanges. \n\n105. We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector. We propose to create an integrated public sector \u2018oil major\u2019 which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies. \n\n106. Our ETF, comprising shares of ten CPSEs, has received overwhelming response in the recent Further Fund Offering (FFO). We will continue to use ETF as a vehicle for further disinvestment of shares. Accordingly, a new ETF with diversified CPSE stocks and other Government holdings will be launched in 2017-18. \n\n107. The focus on resolution of stressed legacy accounts of Banks continues. The legal framework has been strengthened to facilitate resolution, through the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the amendments to the SARFAESI and Debt Recovery Tribunal Acts. In line with the ' Indradhanush ' roadmap, I have provided Rs 10,000 crores for recapitalisation of Banks in 2017-18. Additional allocation will be provided, as may be required. \n\n108. Listing and trading of Security Receipts issued by a securitization company or a reconstruction company under the SARFAESI Act will be permitted in SEBI registered stock exchanges. This will enhance capital flows into the securitization industry and will particularly be helpful to deal with bank NPAs. \n\n109. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana has contributed significantly to funding the unfunded and the underfunded. Last year, the target of Rs 1.22 lakh crores was exceeded. For 2017-18, I propose to double the lending target of 2015-16 and set it at Rs 2.44 lakh crores. Priority will be given to Dalits, Tribals, Backward Classes, Minorities and Women. \n\n110. The Stand Up India scheme was launched by our Government in April 2016 to support Dalit, Tribal and Women entrepreneurs to set up greenfield enterprises and become job creators. Over 16,000 new enterprises have come up through this scheme in activities, as diverse as food processing, garments, diagnostic centres, etc. \n\nDIGITAL ECONOMY \n\n111. Promotion of a digital economy is an integral part of Government\u2019s strategy to clean the system and weed out corruption and black money. It has a transformative impact in terms of greater formalisation of the economy and mainstreaming of financial savings into the banking system. This, in turn, is expected to energise private investment in the country through lower cost of credit. India is now on the cusp of a massive digital revolution. \n\n112. A shift to digital payments has huge benefits for the common man. The earlier initiative of our Government to promote financial inclusion and the JAM trinity were important precursors to our current push for digital transactions. \n\n113. Already there is evidence of increased digital transactions. The BHIM app has been launched. It will unleash the power of mobile phones for digital payments and financial inclusion. 125 lakh people have adopted the BHIM app so far. The Government will launch two new schemes to promote the usage of BHIM; these are, Referral Bonus Scheme for individuals and a Cashback Scheme for merchants. \n\n114. Aadhar Pay, a merchant version of Aadhar Enabled Payment System, will be launched shortly. This will be specifically beneficial for those who do not have debit cards, mobile wallets and mobile phones. A Mission will be set up with a target of 2,500 crore digital transactions for 2017-18 through UPI, USSD, Aadhar Pay, IMPS and debit cards. Banks have targeted to introduce additional 10 lakh new PoS terminals by March 2017. They will be encouraged to introduce 20 lakh Aadhar based PoS by September 2017. \n\n115. Increased digital transactions will enable small and micro enterprises to access formal credit. Government will encourage SIDBI to refinance credit institutions which provide unsecured loans, at reasonable interest rates, to borrowers based on their transaction history. \n\n116. The digital payment infrastructure and grievance handling mechanisms shall be strengthened. The focus would be on rural and semi urban areas through Post Offices, Fair Price Shops and Banking Correspondents. Steps would be taken to promote and possibly mandate petrol pumps, fertilizer depots, municipalities, Block offices, road transport offices, universities, colleges, hospitals and other institutions to have facilities for digital payments, including BHIM App. A proposal to mandate all Government receipts through digital means, beyond a prescribed limit, is under consideration. \n\n117. Government will strengthen the Financial Inclusion Fund to augment resources for taking up these initiatives. \n\n118. Government will consider and work with various stakeholders for early implementation of the interim recommendations of the Committee of Chief Ministers on digital transactions. \n\n119. The Committee on Digital Payments constituted by Department of Economic Affairs has recommended structural reforms in the payment eco system, including amendments to the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. Government will undertake a comprehensive review of this Act and bring about appropriate amendments. To begin with, it is proposed to create a Payments Regulatory Board in the Reserve Bank of India by replacing the existing Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems. Necessary amendments are proposed to this effect in the Finance Bill 2017. \n\n120. As we move faster on the path of digital transactions and cheque payments, we need to ensure that the payees of dishonoured cheques are able to realise the payments. Government is therefore considering the option of amending the Negotiable Instruments Act suitably. \n\nPUBLIC SERVICE \n\n121. I now turn to Public Service. Our focus here is on effective government and efficient service delivery. \n\n122. We have made a strong beginning with regard to Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to LPG and kerosene consumers. Chandigarh and eight districts of Haryana have become kerosene free. 84 Government schemes have also boarded on the DBT platform. \n\n123. The Government e-market place which is now functional for procurement of goods and services, has been selected as one of the winners of the South Asia Procurement Innovation Awards of the World Bank. \n\n124. Our citizens in far flung regions of the country find it difficult to obtain passports and redress passport related grievances. We have decided to utilise the Head Post Offices as front offices for rendering passport services. \n\n125. Our defence forces keep the country safe from both external and internal threats. A Centralised Defence Travel System has now been developed through which travel tickets can be booked online by our soldiers and officers. They do not have to face the hassle of standing in queues with railway warrants. \n\n126. A comprehensive web based interactive Pension Disbursement System for Defence Pensioners will be established. This system will receive pension proposals and make payments centrally. This will reduce the grievances of defence pensioners. \n\n127. At present our citizens, especially those belonging to the poor and unprivileged sections, go through cumbersome procedures of Government recruitment. There are multiplicity of agencies and examinations. We propose to introduce a system of single registration and two tier system of examination. \n\n128. Over the years, the number of tribunals have multiplied with overlapping functions. We propose to rationalise the number of tribunals and merge tribunals wherever appropriate. \n\n129. In the recent past, there have been instances of big time offenders, including economic offenders, fleeing the country to escape the reach of law. We have to ensure that the law is allowed to take its own course. Government is therefore considering introduction of legislative changes, or even a new law, to confiscate the assets of such persons located within the country, till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum. Needless to say that all necessary constitutional safeguards will be followed in such cases. \n\n130. Our Government will continue to remain committed to improve the standards of public service and transparent governance. Service to the people was the life-long commitment of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. As we approach, the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Mahatma, we will take all steps to celebrate it in a befitting manner. A High Level Committee under the Chairmanship of Honourable Prime Minister is proposed to be set up for the same. We will also commemorate the centenary year of Champaran Satyagrah this year. Government of India will support Government of Gujarat to commemorate 100 years of Sabarmati Ashram in 2017, in a befitting manner. 200 years ago in 1817, a valiant uprising of soldiers led by Buxi Jagabandhu took place in Khordha of Odisha. We will commemorate the same appropriately. \n\nPRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT \n\n131. I now turn to the fiscal situation in the context of the Budget for 2017-18. \n\n132. The total expenditure in Budget for 2017-18 has been placed at Rs 21.47 lakh crores. With the abolition of Plan-Non Plan classification of expenditure, the focus is now on Revenue and Capital expenditure. I have stepped up the allocation for Capital expenditure by 25.4% over the previous year. This will have multiplier effects and lead to higher growth. The total resources being transferred to the States and the Union Territories with Legislatures is Rs 4.11 lakh crores, against Rs 3.60 lakh crores in BE 2016-17. Details of allocations for important sectors and schemes and transfer of resources to States are given in Annex II of my Speech. \n\n133. I have made a provision of Rs 3,000 crores under the Department of Economic Affairs to implement various Budget announcements and other new schemes in 2017-18. For Defence expenditure excluding pensions, I have provided a sum of Rs 2,74,114 crores including Rs 86,488 crores for Defence capital. I have increased the allocation for Scientific Ministries to Rs 37,435 crore in 2017-18. \n\n134. For the first time, a consolidated Outcome Budget, covering all Ministries and Departments, is being laid along with the other Budget documents. This will improve accountability of Government expenditure. \n\n135. The FRBM Review Committee has given its report recently. The Committee has done an elaborate exercise and has recommended that a sustainable debt path must be the principal macro-economic anchor of our fiscal policy. The Committee has favoured Debt to GDP of 60% for the General Government by 2023, consisting of 40% for Central Government and 20% for State Governments. Within this framework, the Committee has derived and recommended 3% fiscal deficit for the next three years. The Committee has also provided for 'Escape Clauses', for deviations upto 0.5% of GDP, from the stipulated fiscal deficit target. Among the triggers for taking recourse to these Escape Clauses, the Committee has included \"far-reaching structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal implications\" as one of the factors. Although there is a strong case now to invoke this Escape Clause, I am refraining from doing so. The Report of the Committee will be carefully examined and appropriate decisions taken in due course. \n\n136. Nevertheless, I take note of the fiscal deficit roadmap of 3% recommended by the Committee for the next three years. I have taken into consideration the need for higher public expenditure in the context of sluggish private sector investment and slow global growth. I have kept in mind the recommendation of the Committee that a sustainable debt should be the underlying basis of prudent fiscal management. Considering all these aspects, I have pegged the fiscal deficit for 2017-18 at 3.2% of GDP and remain committed to achieve 3% in the following year. With this gradual approach, I have ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation, without compromising the requirements of public investment. \n\n137. I have taken due care to limit the net market borrowing of Government to Rs 3.48 lakh crores after buyback, much lower than Rs 4.25 lakh crores of the previous year. More importantly, the Revenue Deficit of 2.3% in BE 2016-17 stands reduced to 2.1% in the Revised Estimates. The Revenue Deficit for next year is pegged at 1.9%, against 2% mandated by the FRBM Act. \n\n138. It will be our endeavour to improve upon these fiscal numbers, especially the fiscal deficit, in the next year, through greater focus on quality of expenditure and higher tax realisation from the huge cash deposits in Banks, triggered by demonetisation. \n\nPART B \n\nMadam Speaker, \n\n139. I shall now present my tax proposals: \n\n140. India's tax to GDP ratio is very low, and the proportion of direct tax to indirect tax is not optimal from the view point of social justice. I place before you certain data to indicate that our direct tax collection is not commensurate with the income and consumption pattern of Indian economy. As against estimated 4.2 crore persons engaged in organised sector employment, the number of individuals filing return for salary income are only 1.74 crore. As against 5.6 crore informal sector individual enterprises and firms doing small business in India, the number of returns filed by this category are only 1.81 crore. Out of the 13.94 lakh companies registered in India upto 31st March, 2014, 5.97 lakh companies have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17. Of the 5.97 lakh companies which have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17 so far, as many as 2.76 lakh companies have shown losses or zero income. 2.85 lakh companies have shown profit before tax of less than Rs 1 crore. 28,667 companies have shown profit between Rs 1 crore to Rs 10 crore, and only 7781 companies have profit before tax of more than Rs 10 crores. 141. Among the 3.7 crore individuals who filed the tax returns in 2015-16, 99 lakh show income below the exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh p.a., 1.95 crore show income between Rs 2.5 to Rs 5 lakh, 52 lakh show income between Rs 5 to Rs 10 lakhs and only 24 lakh people show income above Rs 10 lakhs. Of the 76 lakh individual assesses who declare income above Rs 5 lakh, 56 lakh are in the salaried class. The number of people showing income more than Rs 50 lakh in the entire country is only 1.72 lakh. We can contrast this with the fact that in the last five years, more than 1.25 crore cars have been sold, and number of Indian citizens who flew abroad, either for business or tourism, is 2 crore in the year 2015. From all these figures we can conclude that we are largely a tax non-compliant society. The predominance of cash in the economy makes it possible for the people to evade their taxes. When too many people evade taxes, the burden of their share falls on those who are honest and compliant. \n\n142. After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture. During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs 5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs 3.31 crores. This data mining will help us immensely in expanding the tax net as well as increasing the revenues, which was one of the objectives of demonetisation. \n\n143. Madam Speaker, one of the main priorities of our Government is to eliminate the black money component from the economy. We are committed to make our taxation rates more reasonable, our tax administration more fair and expand the tax base in the country. This approach will change the colour of money. \n\nNayi duniya hai, naya daur hai, nayi umang hai \nKuchh the pehle ke tareeke, to hain kuchh aaj ke dhang \nRoshni aake andheron se jo takraegi \nKaale dhan ko bhi badalna pada, aaj apna rang \n\n144. The net tax revenue of 2013-14 was Rs 11.38 lakh crores. This grew by 9.4% in 2014-15 and 17% in 2015-16. As per the RE of 2016-17, we will end the year with a high growth rate of 17% for the second year in a row. Because of the serious efforts made by the Government, the rate of growth of advance tax in personal income tax in the first three quarters of the current financial is 34.8%. \n\n145. Madam Speaker, the thrust of my tax proposals in this Budget is stimulating growth, relief to middle class, affordable housing, curbing black money, promoting digital economy, transparency of political funding and simplification of tax administration. \n\nMeasures for Promoting Affordable Housing and Real Estate Sector \n\n146. In my budget proposals last year, I had announced a scheme for profit-linked income tax exemption for promoters of affordable housing scheme which has received a very good response. However, in order to make this scheme more attractive, I propose certain changes in the scheme. First of all, instead of built up area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr., the carpet area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr. will be counted. Also the 30 sq.mtr. limit will apply only in case of municipal limits of 4 metropolitan cities while for the rest of the country including in the peripheral areas of metros, limit of 60 sq.mtr. will apply. In order to be eligible, the scheme was to be completed in 3 years after commencement. I propose to extend this period to 5 years. \n\n147. At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting completion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income. For builders for whom constructed buildings are stock-in-trade, I propose to apply this rule only after one year of the end of the year in which completion certificate is received so that they get some breathing time for liquidating their inventory. \n\n148. We also propose to make a number of changes in the capital gain taxation provisions in respect of land and building. The holding period for considering gain from immovable property to be long term is 3 years now. This is proposed to be reduced to 2 years. Also, the base year for indexation is proposed to be shifted from 1.4.1981 to 1.4.2001 for all classes of assets including immovable property. This move will significantly reduce the capital gain tax liability while encouraging the mobility of assets. We also plan to extend the basket of financial instruments in which the capital gains can be invested without payment of tax. \n\n149. For Joint Development Agreement signed for development of property, the liability to pay capital gain tax will arise in the year the project is completed. \n\n150. The new capital for State of Andhra Pradesh is being constructed by innovative land-pooling mechanism without use of the Land Acquisition Act. I propose to exempt from capital gain tax, persons holding land on 2.6.2014, the date on which the State of Andhra Pradesh was reorganised, and whose land is being pooled for creation of capital city under the Government scheme. \n\nMeasures for Stimulating Growth \n\n151. A concessional with-holding rate of 5% is being charged on interest earned by foreign entities in external commercial borrowings or in bonds and Government securities. This concession is available till 30.6.2017. I propose to extend it to 30.6.2020. This benefit is also extended to Rupee Denominated (Masala) Bonds. \n\n152. The Government gave income tax exemptions to start-ups with certain conditions last year. For the purpose of carry forward of losses in respect of such start-ups, the condition of continuous holding of 51% of voting rights has been relaxed subject to the condition that the holding of the original promoter/promoters continues. Also the profit linked deduction available to the start-ups for 3 years out of 5 years is being changed to 3 years out of 7 years. \n\n153. Minimum Alternate Tax is at present levied as an advance tax. There is a strong demand for abolition of MAT. Although the plan for phasing out of exemptions will kick in from 1.4.2017, the full benefit of revenue out of phase-out will be available to Government only after 7 to 10 years when all those who are already availing exemptions at present complete their period of availment. Therefore, it is not practical to remove or reduce MAT at present. However, in order to allow companies to use MAT credit in future years, I propose to allow carry forward of MAT upto a period of 15 years instead of 10 years at present. \n\n154. In my Budget proposals in 2015, I had announced that I would be bringing the corporate income tax rate down to 25% gradually. In 2016 Budget, I had announced a reduction by 1% in case of those companies whose turnover is less than Rs 5 crore. In the same Budget, I had also announced that new manufacturing companies who do not avail of any exemption would be charged only 25% income tax. \n\n155. Medium and Small Enterprises occupy bulk of economic activities and are also instrumental in providing maximum employment to people. However, since they do not get many exemptions, they end up paying more taxes as compared to large companies. As per data of financial year 2015-16, 2.85 lakh companies making profit of less than ` 1 crore pay effective tax rate of 30.26% while 298 companies making profit above ` 500 crores pay effective tax rate of 25.90%. \n\n156. In order to make MSME companies more viable and also to encourage firms to migrate to company format, I propose to reduce the income tax for smaller companies with annual turnover upto ` 50 crore to 25%. As per data of Assessment Year 2015-16, there are 6.94 lakh companies filing returns of which 6.67 lakh companies fall in this category and, therefore, percentage-wise 96% of companies will get this benefit of lower taxation. This will make our MSME sector more competitive as compared to large companies. The revenue forgone estimate for this measure is expected to be ` 7,200 crore per annum. \n\n157. In order to give a boost to banking sector, I propose to increase allowable provision for Non-Performing Asset from 7.5% to 8.5%. This will reduce the tax liability of banks. I also propose to tax interest receivable on actual receipt instead of accrual basis in respect of NPA accounts of all nonscheduled cooperative banks also at par with scheduled banks. This will remove hardship of having to pay tax even when interest income is not realised. \n\n158. Considering the wide range of use of LNG as fuel as well as feed stock for petro-chemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on LNG from 5% to 2.5%. \n\n159. In order to incentivise domestic value addition and to promote Make in India, I propose to make changes in Customs & Central Excise duties in respect of certain items which are given in the Annex III of this speech. Some of these proposals are also for addressing duty inversion. \n\nPromoting Digital Economy \n\n160. There is a scheme of presumptive income tax for small and medium tax payers whose turnover is upto Rs 2 crores. At present, 8% of their turnover is counted as presumptive income. I propose to make this 6% in respect of turnover which is received by non-cash means. This benefit will be applicable for transactions undertaken in the current year also. \n\n161. I propose to limit the cash expenditure allowable as deduction, both for revenue as well as capital expenditure, to Rs 10,000. Similarly, the limit of cash donation which can be received by a charitable trust is being reduced from Rs 10,000/- to Rs 2000/-. \n\n162. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Government for black money has suggested that no transaction above Rs 3 lakh should be permitted in cash. The Government has decided to accept this proposal. Suitable amendment to the Income-tax Act is proposed in the Finance Bill for enforcing this decision. \n\n163. To promote cashless transactions, I propose to exempt BCD, Excise/CV duty and SAD on miniaturised POS card reader for m-POS, micro ATM standards version 1.5.1, Finger Print Readers/Scanners and Iris Scanners. Simultaneously, I also propose to exempt parts and components for manufacture of such devices, so as to encourage domestic manufacturing of these devices. \n\nTransparency in Electoral Funding \n\n164. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy. Political parties are an essential ingredient of a multi-party Parliamentary democracy. Even 70 years after Independence, the country has not been able to evolve a transparent method of funding political parties which is vital to the system of free and fair elections. An attempt was made in the past by amending the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, the Companies Act and the Income Tax Act to incentivise donations by individuals, partnership firms, HUFs and companies to political parties. Both the donor and the donee were granted exemption from payment of tax if the accounts were transparently maintained and returns were filed with the competent authorities. Additionally, a list of donors who contributed more than Rs 20,000/- to any party in cash or cheque is required to be maintained. The situation has only marginally improved since these provisions were brought into force. Political parties continue to receive most of their funds through anonymous donations which are shown in cash. \n\n165. An effort, therefore, requires to be made to cleanse the system of political funding in India. Donors have also expressed reluctance in donating by cheque or other transparent methods as it would disclose their identity and entail adverse consequences. I, therefore, propose the following scheme as an effort to cleanse the system of funding of political parties: \n\na) In accordance with the suggestion made by the Election Commission, the maximum amount of cash donation that a political party can receive will be Rs 2000/- from one person. \nb) Political parties will be entitled to receive donations by cheque or digital mode from their donors. \nc) As an additional step, an amendment is being proposed to the Reserve Bank of India Act to enable the issuance of electoral bonds in accordance with a scheme that the Government of India would frame in this regard. Under this scheme, a donor could purchase bonds from authorised banks against cheque and digital payments only. They shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party. These bonds will be redeemable within the prescribed time limit from issuance of bond. \nd) Every political party would have to file its return within the time prescribed in accordance with the provision of the Income-tax Act. Needless to say that the existing exemption to the political parties from payment of income-tax would be available only subject to the fulfilment of these conditions. This reform will bring about greater transparency and accountability in political funding, while preventing future generation of black money. \n\nEase of Doing Business \n\n166. As an anti-avoidance measure, the provision of domestic transfer pricing in respect of related entities was brought in the Finance Act of 2012. Since then the number of entities being covered under domestic pricing has gone up substantially necessitating a longer scrutiny, which causes hardship to domestic companies. In order to reduce the compliance burden due to domestic transfer pricing provisions, I propose to restrict the scope of domestic transfer pricing only if one of the entities involved in related party transaction enjoys specified profit-linked deduction. \n\n167. I propose to increase the threshold limit for audit of business entities who opt for presumptive income scheme from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crores. Similarly, the threshold for maintenance of books for individuals and HUF is being increased from turnover of Rs 10 lakhs to Rs 25 lakhs or income from Rs 1.2 lakhs to Rs 2.5 lakhs. \n\n168. In 2012, Income-tax Act was amended to provide for taxation of those transactions of transfer of shares or interest in a foreign entity deriving its value substantially from Indian assets. Apprehensions have been raised about some difficulties which arise because of this provision in case of transfer of stake of investors of India-based funds located abroad but investing in India-based companies. \n\n169. In order to remove this difficulty, I propose to exempt Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Category I & II from indirect transfer provision. I also propose to issue a clarification that indirect transfer provision shall not apply in case of redemption of shares or interests outside India as a result of or arising out of redemption or sale of investment in India which is chargeable to tax in India. \n\n170. As on today, a TDS of 5% is being deducted from commission payable to individual insurance agents even if the income of some of them may be below taxable limit. I propose to exempt them from the requirement of TDS subject to their filing a self-declaration that their income is below taxable limit. \n\n171. Last year, I had announced a new scheme for presumptive taxation for professionals with receipt upto Rs 50 lakhs p.a. In respect of such assesses, they are being given further benefit in terms of paying advance tax in one instalment instead of four. \n\n172. In order to allow the people to claim the refund expeditiously, the time period for revising a tax return is being reduced to 12 months from completion of financial year, at par with the time period for filing of return. Also the time for completion of scrutiny assessments is being compressed further from 21 months to 18 months for Assessment Year 2018-19 and further to 12 months for Assessment Year 2019-20 and thereafter. \n\nPersonal Income-Tax \n\n173. While the Government is trying to bring within tax-net more people who are evading taxes, the present burden of taxation is mainly on honest tax payers and salaried employees who are showing their income correctly. Therefore, post-demonetisation, there is a legitimate expectation of this class of people to reduce their burden of taxation. Also an argument is made that if a nominal rate of taxation is kept for lower slab, many more people will prefer to come within the tax net. \n\n174. I, therefore, propose to reduce the existing rate of taxation for individual assesses between income of Rs 2.5 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs to 5% from the present rate of 10%. This would reduce the tax liability of all persons below Rs 5 lakh income either to zero (with rebate) or 50% of their existing liability. In order not to have duplication of benefit, the existing benefit of rebate available to the same group of beneficiaries is being reduced to Rs 2500 available only to assessees upto income of Rs 3.5 lakhs. The combined effect of both these measures will mean that there would be zero tax liability for people getting income upto Rs 3 lakhs p.a. and the tax liability will only be Rs 2,500 for people with income between Rs 3 and Rs 3.5 lakhs. If the limit of Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C for investment is used fully the tax would be zero for people with income of Rs 4.5 lakhs. While the taxation liability of people with income upto Rs 5 lakhs is being reduced to half, all the other categories of tax payers in the subsequent slabs will also get a uniform benefit of Rs 12,500/- per person. The total amount of tax foregone on account of this measure is Rs 15,500 crores. \n\n175. In order to make good some of this revenue loss on account of this relief, I propose to levy a surcharge of 10% of tax payable on categories of individuals whose annual taxable income is between Rs 50 lakhs and Rs 1 crore. The existing surcharge of 15% of Tax on people earning more than Rs 1 crore will continue. This is likely to give additional revenue of Rs 2,700 crores. \n\n176. In order to expand tax net, I also plan to have a simple one-page form to be filed as Income Tax Return for the category of individuals having taxable income upto Rs 5 lakhs other than business income. Also a person of this category who files income tax return for the first time would not be subjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information available with the Department regarding his high value transaction. I appeal to all citizens of India to contribute to Nation Building by making a small payment of 5% tax if their income is falling in the lowest slab of Rs 2.5 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs. \n\n177. Some other important proposals for amendment in Tax Laws which are not covered by me in my speech are given in Annex III of this speech. \n\nGoods and Services Tax \n\n178. There has been substantial progress towards ushering in GST, by far, the biggest tax reform since independence. Since the enactment of the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, the preparatory work for this path-breaking reform has been a top priority for the Government. In this context, several teams of officers both from the States and Central Board of Excise and Customs have been working tirelessly to give finishing touch to the Model GST law and rules and other details. Government on its part has promptly given effect to various provisions of the Constitutional Amendment Act, including constitution of the GST Council. Since then, the GST Council held 9 meetings to discuss various issues relating to GST, including broad contours of the GST rate structure, threshold exemption and parameters for composition scheme, details for compensation to States due to implementation of GST, examination of draft model GST law, draft IGST law and the Compensation Law and administrative mechanism for GST. It is my privilege to inform this august house that the GST Council has finalised its recommendations on almost all the issues based on consensus and after spirited debate and discussions. The preparation of IT system for GST is also on schedule. The extensive reach-out efforts to trade and industry for GST will start from 1st April, 2017 to make them aware of the new taxation system. \n\n179. Centre, through the Central Board of Excise & Customs, shall continue to strive to achieve the goal of implementation of GST as per schedule without compromising the spirit of co-operative federalism. Implementation of GST is likely to bring more taxes both to Central and State Governments because of widening of tax net. I have preferred not to make many changes in current regime of Excise & Service Tax because the same are to be replaced by GST soon. \n\nRAPID \n\n180. In the Annual Conclave of Tax officers called \u2018Rajaswa Gyan Sangam\u2019 held in June 2016, the Prime Minister had expressed his desire to bring reforms in tax administration in the form of an approach of RAPID which stands for Revenue, Accountability, Probity, Information and Digitisation. This approach precisely reflects the strategy of Tax Department which is now formulated. While revenue considerations always remain the focus of Revenue Department, we are trying to bring in maximum use of Information Technology to remove human contact with assesses as well as to plug tax avoidance. We will try to maximise our efforts for e-assessment in the coming year. We are also using a lot of data mining capability, both in-house and outsourced. We plan to enforce greater accountability of officers of Tax Department for specific act of commission and omission. I would like to assure everyone that honest, tax-compliant person would be treated with dignity and courtesy. \n\n181. Madam Speaker, my direct tax proposals for exemptions, etc. would result in revenue loss of `22,700 crore but after counting for revenue gain of Rs 2,700 crore for additional resource mobilisation proposal, the net revenue loss in direct tax would come to Rs 20,000 crore. There is no significant loss or gain in my indirect tax proposals. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n182. Madam Speaker , I have outlined the Budget proposals under our overarching agenda: \"Transform, Energise and Clean India\". Our emphasis will now be on implementing all these proposals for the benefit of the farmers, the poor and the underprivileged sections of our society. \n\n183. Madam Speaker , it is said: \"When my aim is right, when my goal is in sight, the winds favour me and I fly\". There is no other day, which is more appropriate for this, than today. \n\n184. With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the House. \n\n(Source: http://www.indiabudget.nic.in) \n  More From Budget Jaitley's tax impact: Who pays more, who pays less & by how much Want to know what's costly and what's cheap after this Budget?

What they don\u2019t realize is that there simply is not a solution under the current U.S. financial system. It is now mathematically impossible for the U.S. government to pay off the U.S. national debt. You see, the truth is that the U.S. government now owes more dollars than actually exist. If the U.S. government went out today and took every single penny from every single American bank, business and taxpayer, they still would not be able to pay off the national debt. And if they did that, obviously American society would stop functioning because nobody would have any money to buy or sell anything. \nAnd the U.S. government would still be massively in debt. \nSo why doesn\u2019t the U.S. government just fire up the printing presses and print a bunch of money to pay off the debt? \nWell, for one very simple reason. \nThat is not the way our system works. \nYou see, for more dollars to enter the system, the U.S. government has to go into more debt. \nThe U.S. government does not issue U.S. currency \u2013 the Federal Reserve does. \nThe Federal Reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers. \nIf you will pull a dollar bill out and take a look at it, you will notice that it says \u201cFederal Reserve Note\u201d at the top. \nIt belongs to the Federal Reserve. \nThe U.S. government cannot simply go out and create new money whenever it wants under our current system. \nInstead, it must get it from the Federal Reserve. \nSo, when the U.S. government needs to borrow more money (which happens a lot these days) it goes over to the Federal Reserve and asks them for some more green pieces of paper called Federal Reserve Notes. \nThe Federal Reserve swaps these green pieces of paper for pink pieces of paper called U.S. Treasury bonds. The Federal Reserve either sells these U.S. Treasury bonds or they keep the bonds for themselves (which happens a lot these days). \nSo that is how the U.S. government gets more green pieces of paper called \u201cU.S. dollars\u201d to put into circulation. But by doing so, they get themselves into even more debt which they will owe even more interest on. \nSo every time the U.S. government does this, the national debt gets even bigger and the interest on that debt gets even bigger. \nAre you starting to get the picture? \nAs you read this, the U.S. national debt is approximately 12 trillion dollars, although it is going up so rapidly that it is really hard to pin down an exact figure. \nSo how much money actually exists in the United States today? \nWell, there are several ways to measure this. \nThe \u201cM0\u2033 money supply is the total of all physical bills and currency, plus the money on hand in bank vaults and all of the deposits those banks have at reserve banks. As of mid-2009, the Federal Reserve said that this amount was about 908 billion dollars. \nThe \u201cM1\u2033 money supply includes all of the currency in the \u201cM0\u2033 money supply, along with all of the money held in checking accounts and other checkable accounts at banks, as well as all money contained in travelers\u2019 checks. According to the Federal Reserve , this totaled approximately 1.7 trillion dollars in December 2009, but not all of this money actually \u201cexists\u201d as we will see in a moment. \nThe \u201cM2\u2033 money supply includes everything in the \u201cM1\u2033 money supply plus most other savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small denomination time deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000). According to the Federal Reserve , this totaled approximately 8.5 trillion dollars in December 2009, but once again, not all of this money actually \u201cexists\u201d as we will see in a moment. \nThe \u201cM3\u2033 money supply includes everything in the \u201cM2\u2033 money supply plus all other CDs (large time deposits and institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve does not keep track of M3 anymore, but according to ShadowStats.com it is currently somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 trillion dollars. But again, not all of this \u201cmoney\u201d actually \u201cexists\u201d either. \nSo why doesn\u2019t it exist? \nIt is because our financial system is based on something called fractional reserve banking. \nWhen you go over to your local bank and deposit $100, they do not keep your $100 in the bank. Instead, they keep only a small fraction of your money there at the bank and they lend out the rest to someone else. Then, if that person deposits the money that was just borrowed at the same bank, that bank can loan out most of that money once again. In this way, the amount of \u201cmoney\u201d quickly gets multiplied. But in reality, only $100 actually exists. The system works because we do not all run down to the bank and demand all of our money at the same time. \nAccording to the New York Federal Reserve Bank , fractional reserve banking can be explained this way\u2026. \n\u201c If the reserve requirement is 10%, for example, a bank that receives a $100 deposit may lend out $90 of that deposit. If the borrower then writes a check to someone who deposits the $90, the bank receiving that deposit can lend out $81. As the process continues, the banking system can expand the initial deposit of $100 into a maximum of $1,000 of money ($100+$90+81+$72.90+\u2026=$1,000).\u201d \nSo much of the \u201cmoney\u201d out there today is basically made up out of thin air. \nIn fact, most banks have no reserve requirements at all on savings deposits, CDs and certain kinds of money market accounts. Primarily, reserve requirements apply only to \u201ctransactions deposits\u201d \u2013 essentially checking accounts. \nThe truth is that banks are freer today to dramatically \u201cmultiply\u201d the amounts deposited with them than ever before. But all of this \u201cmultiplied\u201d money is only on paper \u2013 it doesn\u2019t actually exist. \nThe point is that the broadest measures of the money supply (M2 and M3) vastly overstate how much \u201creal money\u201d actually exists in the system. \nSo if the U.S. government went out today and demanded every single dollar from all banks, businesses and individuals in the United States it would not be able to collect 14 trillion dollars (M3) or even 8.5 trillion dollars (M2) because those amounts are based on fractional reserve banking. \nSo the bottom line is this\u2026. \n#1) If all money owned by all American banks, businesses and individuals was gathered up today and sent to the U.S. government, there would not be enough to pay off the U.S. national debt. \n#2) The only way to create more money is to go into even more debt which makes the problem even worse. \nYou see, this is what the whole Federal Reserve System was designed to do. It was designed to slowly drain the massive wealth of the American people and transfer it to the elite international bankers. \nIt is a game that is designed so that the U.S. government cannot win. As soon as they create more money by borrowing it, the U.S. government owes more than what was created because of interest. \nIf you owe more money than ever was created you can never pay it back. \nThat means perpetual debt for as long as the system exists. \nIt is a system designed to force the U.S. government into ever-increasing amounts of debt because there is no escape. \nWe could solve this problem by shutting down the Federal Reserve and restoring the power to issue U.S. currency to the U.S. Congress (which is what the U.S. Constitution calls for). But the politicians in Washington D.C. are not about to do that. \nSo unless you are willing to fundamentally change the current system, you might as well quit complaining about the U.S. national debt because it is now mathematically impossible to pay it off. \n***UPDATE*** \nIt has been suggested that the same dollar can be used to pay off debt over and over \u2013 this is theoretically true as long as the dollar remains in the system. \nFor example, if the U.S. government gives China a dollar to pay off a debt, there is a good chance that the U.S. government will be able to acquire that dollar again and use it to pay off another debt. \nHowever, this is not true when debt is retired with the Federal Reserve. In that case, money is actually removed from the system. In fact, because of the \u201cmoney multiplier\u201d, when debt is retired with the Federal Reserve it can remove ten times that amount of money (and actually more, but let\u2019s not get too technical) from the system. \nYou see, fractional reserve banking works both ways. When $100 is introduced into the system, it can theoretically create $1000 as the example in the article above demonstrates. However, when that $100 is removed, it can have the opposite impact. \nAnd considering the fact that the Federal Reserve \u201cpurchased\u201d the vast majority of new U.S. government debt last year , we have got a real mess on our hands. \nEven if a way could be figured out how to pay off all the debt we owe to foreign nations (such as China, Japan, etc.) it would still be mathematically impossible to pay off the debt that we owe to the Federal Reserve which is exploding so fast that it is hard to even keep track of. \nOf course we could repudiate that debt and shut down the Federal Reserve, but very few in Washington D.C. have any interest in doing that. \nIt has also been suggested that instead of just using dollars to pay off the U.S. national debt, we could use the assets of the U.S. government to pay it off. \nThat is rather extreme, but let us consider that for a moment. \nThat total value of all physical assets in the United States, both publicly and privately owned, is somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 to 50 trillion dollars. Of course the idea of the U.S. government \u201cowning\u201d every single asset of the American people is repugnant to our entire way of life, but let\u2019s assume that for a moment. \nAccording to the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government , which is an official United States government report, the total liabilities of the United States government, including future social security and medicare payments that the U.S. government is already committed to pay out, now exceed 65 TRILLION dollars. This amount is more than the entire GDP of the whole world. \nIn fact, there are other authors who have written that the actual figure for the future liabilities of the U.S. government should be much higher, but let\u2019s be conservative and go with 65 trillion for now. \nSo, if the U.S. government took control of all physical assets in the United States and sold them off, it could not even make enough money to pay for everything that the U.S. government is already on the hook for. \nOuch. \nIf you have not read the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government , you really should. Actually the 2009 report should be available very soon if it isn\u2019t already. If anyone knows if it is available, please let us know. \nThe truth is that the U.S. government is in much bigger financial trouble than we have been led to believe. \nFor example, according to the report (which remember is an official U.S. government report) the real U.S. budget deficit for 2008 was not 455 billion dollars. It was actually 5.1 trillion dollars. \nSo why the difference? \nThe CBO\u2019s 455 billion figure is based on cash accounting, while the 5.1 trillion figure in the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government is based on GAAP accounting. GAAP accounting is what is used by all the major firms on Wall Street and it is regarded as a much more accurate reflection of financial reality. \nSo needless to say, the United States is in a financial mess of unprecedented magnitude. \nSo what should we do? Does anyone have any suggestions? \n***UPDATE 2*** \nWe have received a lot of great comments on this article. Trying to understand the U.S. financial system (even after studying it for years) can be very difficult at times. In fact, it can almost seem like playing 3 dimensional chess. \nSeveral readers have correctly pointed out that when the U.S. money supply is expanded by the Federal Reserve, the interest that is to be paid on that new debt is not created. \nSo where does the money to pay that interest come from? Well, eventually the money supply has to be expanded some more. But that creates even more debt. \nThat brings us to the next point. \nSeveral readers have insisted that the Federal Reserve is not privately owned and that since it returns \u201cmost\u201d of the profits it makes to the U.S. government that we should not be concerned about the debt owed to it. \nThe truth is that what you have with the Federal Reserve is layers of ownership. The following was originally posted on the Federal Reserve\u2019s website\u2026. \n\u201cThe twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by Congress as the operating arms of the nation\u2019s central banking system, are organized much like private corporations \u2013 possibly leading to some confusion about \u201cownership.\u201d For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan; dividends are, by law, 6 percent per year.\u201d \nSo Federal Reserve \u201cstock\u201d is owned by member banks. So who owns the member banks? Well, when you sift through additional layers of ownership, you will ultimately find that people like the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and the Queen of England have very large ownership interests in the big banks. But there are so many layers of ownership that they are able to disguise themselves well. \nYou see, these people are not stupid. They did not become the richest people in the world by being morons. It was the banking elite of the world who designed the Federal Reserve and it is the banking elite of the world who benefit the most from the Federal Reserve today. In the article above when we described the Federal Reserve as \u201ca private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers\u201d we may have been oversimplifying things a bit, but it is the essence of what is going on. \nIn an excellent article that she did on the Federal Reserve, Ellen Brown described a number of the ways that the Federal Reserve makes money for those who own it\u2026. \nThe interest on bonds acquired with its newly-issued Federal Reserve Notes pays the Fed\u2019s operating expenses plus a guaranteed 6% return to its banker shareholders. A mere 6% a year may not be considered a profit in the world of Wall Street high finance, but most businesses that manage to cover all their expenses and give their shareholders a guaranteed 6% return are considered \u201cfor profit\u201d corporations. \nIn addition to this guaranteed 6%, the banks will now be getting interest from the taxpayers on their \u201creserves.\u201d The basic reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve is 10%. The website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York explains that as money is redeposited and relent throughout the banking system, this 10% held in \u201creserve\u201d can be fanned into ten times that sum in loans; that is, $10,000 in reserves becomes $100,000 in loans. Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.8 puts the total \u201cloans and leases in bank credit\u201d as of September 24, 2008 at $7,049 billion. Ten percent of that is $700 billion. That means we the taxpayers will be paying interest to the banks on at least $700 billion annually \u2013 this so that the banks can retain the reserves to accumulate interest on ten times that sum in loans. \nThe banks earn these returns from the taxpayers for the privilege of having the banks\u2019 interests protected by an all-powerful independent private central bank, even when those interests may be opposed to the taxpayers\u2019 \u2014 for example, when the banks use their special status as private money creators to fund speculative derivative schemes that threaten to collapse the U.S. economy. Among other special benefits, banks and other financial institutions (but not other corporations) can borrow at the low Fed funds rate of about 2%. They can then turn around and put this money into 30-year Treasury bonds at 4.5%, earning an immediate 2.5% from the taxpayers, just by virtue of their position as favored banks. A long list of banks (but not other corporations) is also now protected from the short selling that can crash the price of other stocks. \nThe reality is that there are a lot of ways that the Federal Reserve is a money-making tool. Yes, they do return \u201csome\u201d of their profits to the U.S. government each year. But the Federal Reserve is NOT a government agency and it DOES make profits. \nSo just how much money is made over there? The truth is that we have to rely on what the Federal Reserve tells us, because they have never been subjected to a comprehensive audit by the U.S. government. \nEver. \nRight now there is legislation going through Congress that would change that, and the Federal Reserve is fighting it tooth and nail. They are warning that such an audit could cause a financial disaster. \nWhat are they so afraid of? \nAre they afraid that we might get to peek inside and see what they have been up to all these years? \nIf you are a history buff, then you probably know that debates about a \u201ccentral bank\u201d go all the way back to the Founding Fathers. \nThe European banking elite have always been determined to control our currency, and that is exactly what is happening today. \nEver since the Federal Reserve was created, there have been members of the U.S. Congress that have been trying to warn the American people about the insidious nature of this institution. \nJust check out what the Honorable Louis McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee had to say all the way back in the 1930s\u2026. \n\u201cSome people think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. They are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers; and rich and predatory money lenders.\u201d \nThe Federal Reserve is not the solution and it never has been. \nThe Federal Reserve is the problem. \nAny thoughts? OOPS! \u2013 U.S. Government Unemployment Numbers Have To Be Revised Because They Were Off By Almost One MILLION! \u00bb Bart \nHas there ever been a time in history when money in circulation equalled or exceeded all credit/debt \u2013 I doubt it. As long as there is one person willing to extend credit to another you are going to have this imbalance. \nThe big problem we just went through with the credit bubble was that the central banks lost control of the money supply. This led to a global credit bubble, which popped when there was a run on Lehman\u2019s bank because the credit markets froze (largely due to an inability to price risk). \nA run on the bank is when people have a money preference and pull out all their cash. This used to result in liquidity crises like 1907 when the British demanded we pay all our debt in gold. Now, the FDIC pays out on bank runs or the Fed does. We just went through the largest liquidity crisis in history and the Fed handled by doubling the assets on their balance sheet they created trillions in reserves. More importantly this \u201cdebt\u201d that is the credit that was extended has 0% interest attached, so as the economy stabilizes the debt-service shoudl be pretty easy. \nYou\u2019re right that in our system when we create money we create debt. I prefer direct money creation where Congress creates money to pay for infrastructure and that\u2019s how we expand the money supply. Blade \nBart\u2026is your last name Simpson by any chance? If I have ten bucks and loan you five there is still ten bucks in circulation!! Hellooo! It is when I go to the printing press and print up another fiver like I just lent you and stick it in my pocket so I still have ten that is the problem!! \nIn 1835, under President Andrew Jackson, the US Federal Budget was balanced and the National Debt was paid in full. This has never happened since. This fine man did not appreciate Rockefeller and his fellow printer schiesters!! Get some history knowledge Bart, then you might be smart enough to grow some backbone instead of sounding comically loony! Josh \nWho exactly do we owe all this money to? Let them try and collect it. Worst case we stop spending trillions of the defense budget. Honestly people can\u2019t realize the whole monetary system is scam to turn as all into slaves and deny us much as possible so that New World Order can use all as much output as possible for their own designs. RIck M. \nThe problem isn\u2019t the lending or borrowing. i.e. if I borrow a cup of sugar from my neighbor, they don\u2019t expect to have a 5-pound bag returned to them as payment. \nYes, there WAS a time that money exceeded the debt, it was when the people worked to save for what they purchased, or loaned it without interest. The issue that makes the banking system so very flawed is that they loan money (or a percentage thereof) that was entrusted to them to others with the interest collected from all parties making use of the original individuals actual deposit. \nWhile one could argue that this is a reasonable thing to do; which it was only slightly less corrupt in intention when there was REAL money, EG: Gold or silver, on hold; the fact that the depositors are now depositing federal reserve notes (which are counted at face value \u2013 already fractionally inflated) to be loaned using fractional accounting. THIS is what causes the so-called debt bubble. \nThe process cannot go on indefinitely, just as any pyramid or ponzi scheme\u2026 sooner or later the whole thing falls apart because there aren\u2019t sufficient real funds to support the illusion. \nThe author here is absolutely correct, there isn\u2019t enough \u201cmoney\u201d to repay the bankers, so the eventual collapse of the entire system is inevitable. Since the debt was incurred against treasury bonds, the only way to repay it now is with REAL PROPERTY since we don\u2019t have real reserves to back it. In essence \u2013 they will own everything as it becomes nationalized to cover the increasing debt. Catch-22 \nUm, yeah, I agree that we ignored the Constitutional requirement BUT: If we now were to somehow close down the Fed, would you really want to turn over the power of money creation to the current congress? I cannot imagine letting the 535 economically-ignorant party hacks devise a sound replacement. I fear for our republic. ebeye \nIt\u2019s ALWAYS been impossible to pay off the \u201cdebt\u201d! The interest has to be created, which is more debt! The only way to eliminate it is to repudiate the Federal Reserve and it\u2019s claim of debt upon the people, then revert to either a nationally derived currency, or simply allow any form of currency to be used. \nhttp://www.ivamu.com/ Garynils \nThe creature from Jeckyl Island has now officially sealed the fate of ALL future generations of Americans. The really scary thing about this financial meltdown is the historical precedent that has benn established. What is the favorite remedy that corrupt governments use when faced with economic collapse? That\u2019s right. War! Philippians 6-12. Russ L. Smith \nSo they \u201cdoubled their balance sheet\u201d which means that everything lost 50% of it\u2019s value, or every dollar became 50 cents. That will make paying off the debt twice as hard. Don Robertson \nYes, it is very alarming the sort of things mathematics can point out. But do not start throwing your money out the window for the wind to catch and take away. \nThere is absolutely nothing in the Universe that can be described EXACTLY by mathematics. Why not? Because there are no two things anywhere in the Universe that are so perfectly alike, we can add them 1+1 and say \u201c2\u201d describes these things to every extent possible. \nThe American dollar is still coveted by more people on this planet than any other currency. \nNot one in a 100 people reading this post have ever seen a Yuan, a Euro, or even a Peso. Not one in a thousand has one in their pocket! \nI live right on the Canadian border. The Canadians come over here to shop because milk is like $6.00 a gallon in Canada. They come over here to buy gasoline, and fill up five gallon containers they take home in their trunks. \nAnd on the other border? The Mexicans, and the South Americans crash the border gates to get in. \nThe strength of an economy can be measured by the amount of currency that can be floated WITHOUT all that currency causing such inflation that buying power is destroyed. \nYou can spend dollars in every country in the world. \nThe dollar bill is the currency even the Iranian street vendors -hoard in their mattresses. \nThe big economic problem right now is deflation. And it\u2019s a wonderful problem to have, if you have money in the bank, or even if you just have a job. \nThe reason for the deflation is, not everyone does have a job. \nThe credit economy is the culprit. Put your money in the bank. Leave it there. That\u2019s the best advice anyone can give. \nForget the debt. No one is asking to have it paid off. No one ever thought it would be paid off. \nBelieve me, there are a lot of gold bugs today who are licking their wounds from this pop of their bubble. Expect it to get worse for them too. You cannot spend gold at the local hardware store. Jim \nKeep a written journal of these days and your perception of them. What you knew and what is. They will be a window into darkness and why. Truthteller \nTurn the Fed into an actual department of the Federal Government or amalgamate it with the Treasury. Money can then be issued without interest having to be paid to a private bank. At one stroke, a large part of the current debt can be removed as the debt owing to the \u2018former Federal Reserve\u2019 would be cancelled. Or is this too simple an idea? Mr. Universe \nIt is an excellent idea, i can just see a hole in it though, if we were to impliment this plan, whats to stop the government from collecting the debt from it\u2019s citzens??? just wondering very, very good plan though. \nSimple solutions are often the ones that are the most overlooked \nSincerely \nhttp://home.iae.nl/users/lightnet/creator/nationaldebt.htm This Awareness indicates that you must understand that when the Federal Reserve bank, the privately owned Federal Reserve bank, was given authority to print Federal Reserve notes instead of the Treasury Department writing the Treasury Notes as directed by the U.S. Constitution, these Federal Reserve notes were not printed to be given out to the economy, in the way as the Treasury Notes of the Treasury Department. Rather, they were loaned to the U.S. government and then circulated into society, and society was required to pay back interest on the IRS notes and that amount of interest accumulated to the point of approximately 5 trillion dollars at this time (Revelations of Awareness newsletter issue no. 430 1994), to where, if everything in the United States were sold, half of the debt would still be owed. \nThis Awareness indicates that the Treasury Department has the potential for totally denouncing the Federal Reserve debt of 5 trillion dollars because it was illegal in the first place. The Treasury Department in the U.S. Constitution is the only proper way of financing the nation; Congress, operating the Treasury Department has the right to mint and coin money, and set the value thereof. \nThis Awareness indicates that in this fact, the Federal Reserve was never given any such a right, even with the vote of the Congress, because Congress did not have the right to relegate its obligations to the Federal Reserve, therefore the entire debt of five trillion dollars, because it was illegal in the fist place, is not forcible in a technical sense. MisterMoney \nInflation is the plan! \nThe debt can be repaid in cheaper dollars, so these politicians think, when the dollar drops in value, and they are able to raise more taxes at higher levels. But this only works if wages and earnings raise in tandem with inflation. \nFor example, if sales tax is 6%, and I buy a can of beans for a $1.00 I pay 6 cents in taxes. When inflation hits and that can of beans now costs $3.00, I pay 18 cents in taxes. And my higher wages or salary move me up in the tax brackets, so I pay more taxes on the inflated dollars, as do corporations. \nThe politicians will never say it, but that is the plan, just inflate this debt down to zilch, public be damned. Rob \nBart, \nI applaud your attempt to explain the situation\u2026 but it sounds like you are reciting a Economics 101 text book, and no offense intended, it would seem that you are not entirely knowledgeable of the facts. \nYour post is entirely ignorant of the politics behind money. \nWhat lead to our current situation? Your statement that the central banks lost control of the money supply is over simplification, at best, ignorance at worst. Over the past two decades, at the behest of powerful interest groups and lobbyist, Congress dismantled and restructured the then existing regulatory restrictions that protected the economy from the text book situation which you described. And the result? It was predicted many years ago\u2026 screamed from the mountaintops for anyone to hear. But no one paid attention. Technically those vested with the power to create law don\u2019t actually break the law. When the regulation and rule of law are manipulated, the eventual outcome of those changes are predictable. Knowledge is power. Ignorance is misfortune. \nAs for runs on the bank\u2026 your illustration is a far cry from anything other than an illusion. While it is true that banks do not carry ready reserves of Cash on Hand to cover the cumulative balances of their accounts, the monies of the accounts themselves are properly recorded in the banks ledgers. Customers would not need to demand the balance in full, in cash. They could demand a cashiers check, or they could simply walk into another financial institution of their choosing and write a draft or check to transfer their monies from their old bank to their new institution. In the event of a bank failure, the proper action would have been to let the bank fail, at which point its assets would have been seized by the government, it deposits covered (to an extent) by FDIC, and then liquidated or managed in probate to recover losses on behalf of the injured parties. No Bail Outs would have been required. But there would have been a full accounting and investigation of corruption, mismanagement, maleficent, etc. Instead TARPs and Bailouts were appropriated and the monies were used to pay up to 100% on the dollar to the banks themselves, and subsequently the looting and pillaging of America began. \nLet there be no doubt that our current economic crisis is very real, far from over, and deliberately engineered. What are the short and long term implications? As for credit and liquidity, Wall Street is flush, but Main Street has dried up. TARP funds and various bailouts have been used, not to extend credit to Main Street, but rather to starve out the middle class, small and medium businesses, local banks and middle America so that those whom have access and control of credit may buy up practically anything and everything of value for pennies on the dollar. Classic and textbook \u201cGrapes of Wraith\u201d Economics 101, where the Barons and Tycoons of Industry run rough shod over desperate peoples in tough times. The gains are privatized and the losses are socialized. \nAs for the long term implications\u2026 Doubling the money supply with 0% interest devalues the dollar and lends itself to several carnations of inflation, which may only be offset by artificially dampening cost of infrastructure and labor. In other words, importing cheap labor and exporting manufacturing and industry. Ring any bells? Ironically this only excelerates the phenomena. \nUltimately, this incomprehensible level of debt may only be solved one of two ways, if not both: 1) The yielding and merger of the American dollar into a new hyper national or international financial union, or 2) Negotiation or Eradication of Debt via the Conquest of Wars and Treaties. Hmm\u2026 have you been watching the news lately? G8 What? U.N. / IMF / World Bank are doing what exactly? What treaties have been pending on the horizon? Pray tell me, what exactly were the goals of The Project for the New American Century and the Council on Foreign Relations? Please tell me that you are at least somewhat familiar with the organizations that advise and create the policies that our Congress reviews and our President enacts as policy? \nBottom line: this is an engineered crisis with but one ultimate goal. Not merely the consolidation of wealth, but a consolidation of Power. The Federal Reserve itself has undergone consolidation. And Wall Street. And Main Street. And soon\u2026 as we continue marching towards globalization via Conquest and Treaty and the expansion of Power\u2026 Our National Sovereignty. \nAnd although I most certainly agree with you and applaud you on your preference for direct money creation where Congress creates money to pay for infrastructure to expand the economy, alas, there too you have unwittingly overlooked or intentionally omitted several key details. \nAlthough Congress does have the constitutional authority to mint coin and regulate the value of domestic and foreign monies, and does stimulate the economy with monies spent on militaries, infrastructure, and commerce, it ultimately can not and should not be responsible for insuring our economy. That said, for better or for worse, with our burgeoning debt our prosperity is being washed away. \nDebt is slavery. Expanding the money supply with fiat currency is a devils game. The only thing that truly generates wealth is labor and resources. You can not exploit resources without access, be it public or private, to land. Be it beef, beans, or bread, or be it lumber, steel, silver, or gold, without land the supply to resources is severed, and with it the capacitance for manufacturing and industry are also severed. \nWe could easily transform our fiat money supply into that of one based entirely upon industrial and agricultural commodities, in addition to gold, silver, and other precious metals. But there in lies the crutch. Energy. For mining and harvesting, refinement and manufacturing, and for transportation. \nWhat, pray tell, has our current economic crises entailed? Hmm\u2026 Land, I.e. Real Estate. Commodities and Industry, I.e. Main Street and Jobs. Energy, I.e. oil, gas, coal, and electricity. Financing, I.e. Credit, cash, and liquidity. What exactly have been several of the key issues facing most people these past several years? \nDo you see the pattern yet. Do you recognize the cause, the reaction, the solution? It is NOT simply a matter of the central banks losing control of the money supply. It is about consolidation of financial and political power. Period. Once anyone realizes that, they will be better able to cope with the difficulties at hand and work towards regaining their financial footing, and hopefully, eventually, return to being financially independent. \nWhen you are ready to set aside that primer for Economics 101 and start learning how things really work, I will be not only applauding you, but cheering you on. \nBest wishes. Jason Seagraves \nIt is not \u201cimpossible\u201d for the national debt to be paid off. It could theoretically be paid off without inflation, in fact. It would just take time. \nIf the money creation was halted, for example, the debt could be paid off over a very long period of time in the following manner: \n1. I am taxed $100. 2. The government uses my $100 to pay down the debt to China. 3. China uses this $100 to buy a product from my company. 4. My company is taxed on this sale. 5. The government takes that tax money and gives it to China, again, etc., etc., etc. bob Tom Dennen \nSOME BROAD NOTES ON THE HISTORY OF MONEY (Without the complicated detail). by Tom Dennen, author of \u2018Grand Theft, Planet or Heidi\u2019s Free Bar & Grill\u2019\u2013 (free on the Internet).

The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in inequity and born in sin \u2026 Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them but leave them the power to create money, and, with a flick of a pen, they will create enough money to buy it back again \u2026 Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, for then this would be a better and happier world to live in \u2026 But, if you want to continue to be the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit. \u201d Sir Josiah Stamp, director of the Bank of England and the second richest man in Britain in the 1920s, speaking at the University of Texas in 1927.\u201cIn a dark time, the eye begins to see,\u201d Theodore Roethke.\u201cCAPITALISM IS A SYSTEM THROUGH WHICH WEALTH IS REGULARLY TRANSFERED (STOLEN) FROM THOSE WHO CREATE IT TO THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY WEALTHY, WHILE THOSE WHO CREATE IT ARE KEPT UNAWARE OF THE THEFT BY \u2018THE MATRIX\u2019\u201d\u2013 t.d.\u201cAll wealth is created by work.\u201d\u2013 Adam Smith.

Since the early goldsmiths discovered fractional (reserve) banking, (created money out of thin air) and introduced predatory lending, they have been thrown out of every courntry they set up in, after which those countries returned to resource-based economies and went through several decades of economic recovery. Until the sixteenth century, in Holland. Then and there, when the goldsmiths were discovered plying their usurious debt / lending system, the already wealthy government and merchant classes simply joined them in the first full \u201ccollusion among corporatocracy, authoritarian government, controlled media and education.\u201d\u2013 Fascism.

The thing is, it was for keeps.\u2018Tulip Mania\u2019 is a controlled boom situation; controlled by those who run the Great Wealth Shift every generation, starting with the South Sea Bubble crash in 1720. This set of conclusions is largely gathered from a monetary history according to James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg: Every fifty years or so since the South Sea Crash, financial markets have peaked \u2013 and exactly nine years later, crashed \u2013 followed by a depression during which, bracketed by expensive wars, vast amounts of properties have been foreclosed and the \u2018masters\u2019 transfered huge amounts of the wealth accumulated by the working class \u2013\u201call wealth is created by work\u201d (Adam Smith) \u2013 who were left to starve.

We will not see the end of it for a long while \u2013 all we will see are futile reports of the transfer of huge amounts of money to the banking cartels and hear their stories of \u2018green shoots\u2019 and \u2018recovery\u2019. Until people are back to work there is no recovery. The essence of fiscal control is not race, religion or nationality but just a passion for control over other humans. SOVEREIGN MONEY Both Lincoln and Kennedy were assassinated after introducing sovereign currencies, which were quickly removed from circulation after the killings. What happened to Schwartzenegger\u2019s IOUs? They were de facto sovereign currency paid back on maturity by the state at a 3.75% interest. (It took the entire western world including Russia, incidentally, to crush Hitler who had also introduced sovereign money against the web of banking debt). When the directors of the Bank of England asked what was responsible for the booming economy of the young American colonies, Benjamin Franklin explained that the colonial governments issued their own money, which they both lent and spent into the economy:\u201cIn the Colonies,\u201d he said, \u201cwe issue our own paper money. It is called \u2018Colonial Scrip.\u2019 We issue it in proper proportion to make the goods pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one. You see, a legitimate government can both spend and lend money into circulation, while banks can only lend significant amounts of their promissory bank notes, for they can neither give away nor spend but a tiny fraction of the money the people need.\u201cThus, when your bankers here in England place money in circulation, there is always a debt principal to be returned and usury to be paid. The result is that you have always too little credit in circulation to give the workers full employment. You do not have too many workers, you have too little money in circulation, and that which circulates, all bears the endless burden of unpayable debt and usury.\u201d (Wikipedia) One of the most significant \u2013 and Apocalyptic \u2013 leaks is Ellen Brown\u2019s book, \u2018Web of Debt\u2019 along with the Global Warming lies now out in the open. The Bilderbergs / governments / banks / merchants / landowners / fake scientists / Big Pharma and the rest are now too big not to fail at keeping their secrets. Solution? This will set us free: Return to resource-based economies. Do not borrow unless it\u2019s from a state, county, city or people-owned bank that does not charge interest. Gather together and itemize all the resources of your community and learn to barter. Keep your wealth to yourselves. \u2013 you created it.

It is disingenuous to mis-match securities to day zero. Asking for every dollar loaned over widely varying periods of maturity to be immediately returned is nonsensical. To put it in microeconomic terms, an individual on a $50k salary who borrows $200k, will pay about ~$1.4k per month over 25 years @ 7% pa. Were the borrower asked to repay the entire sum TODAY does that mean the borrower is insolvent? No. The borrower has 25 years of income, which if NPV\u2019d at a 7% discount rate, shows the borrower is quite solvent. If these data sets for US debt are to be put in their correct perspective, GDP must be summed for the same period at the debt, or its average maturity. To present the debt as a fraction of one year\u2019s GDP only is just bad math.

Suppose the debt is to China, for the supply of a billion t-shirts, 200 million microwave ovens, etc. To repay the debt the US has to create a billion t-shirts, 200 million microwave ovens etc (plus interest) more than it consumes. The important bit is that the debtor\u2019s production must be more than its consumption. \nNow introduce money into the equation and start from zero cash in the US. The US has assets such as mining rights, so they can sell something to a dollar holder for cash. The cash can be used to repay debt, or it can be invested in productive activities which generate a profit. The tipping point for a country being or not being able to repay its debt is not related to the money supply. What you need to look at is the relationship between productivity, consumption, assets, debt and interest rates. Current and future generations of Americans need to (a) produce more than they consume to make up for the past generations which consumed more than they produced. Or they can (b) reject the inequitable system and default. Or they can (c) embrace the inequitable system and use the world\u2019s largest military and most brainwashed population to go on a global pillaging spree in the name of freedom. My money\u2019s not on (a). \nRemember, when a debt is repaid with money it is the debt which disappears, not the money.

Like listening to an exact recording of the \u201cnews\u201d on national tv. Wake up FOOL, youve been had! Greg \nOne major flaw in the argument. Your right on how the money supply works and expands, but your forgetting that money is still just pieces of paper floating around. They really do not have value. Our goods and services are what really has value. How would it be mathematically impossible to pay back our debt with our goods and services when our debt has not yet even reached the dollar amount of all goods and services we produce in 1 year. Not even one year worth of our goods and services (GDP) would be needed to pay the debt back. We have had much higher debt in the past comparably. This is if you actually look at our debt compared to GDP. This is like you would look at your own debt compared to your income in your household. If my debt was equal to my income this year, I might be very worried, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. jos boersema \nHi, the founding fathers of the USA also said (iirc) that the people needed to be educated. For ppl (like me) who are not professionally in banking the money issue (in full) can seem complicated. I think that for sufficient political oversight #1 thing for a new system must be simplicity. Only what is simple people can understand, only what people can understand they can inspect, police & keep righteous. \nWhat do you think of this system: a Gov issued fiat, legal tender law, fit for debt, and taxes payed in it. Now the money will work as money in exchange. Then a central gov owned bank as the infrastructural backbone, with collective accounts for banks (privacy from gov). Retail account & savings account services banks who are prohibited to lend out a single dime (inspected by gov), by law prohibited to lend anything. Then a separate mortgage & consumer credit sector, also heavily policed by gov. By law nobody can resell a loan to a third party. Then a third sector which handles business upstart & expansion credit, these investments are in the form of plain loans and can neither be traded to third parties. \nIt is my understanding that this third sector has to be dominated by political will of the people, to prevent that sector from growing up those tiranical and corrupt corporations the USA founding fathers may have talked about. \nThe money would then be spend into circulation and taxed out of it, the government never lends a single coin from anyone (only taxes). As a rule the (next) government never pays back loans, so that future govs won`t be able to get credit either \u2026 \nI`d say this is simple, what people expect too. To round it off: international businesses are prohibited henceforth, and politics rules on import/export tariffs to protect its markets and industries out of long term self interest (at a cost to global economic effeciency). This program also requires the government to be a faithful true democracy \u2026\u2026 \nIs this something, if not why ? I personally don`t believe in gold / silver money that much.

You know HOW we can pay it back though? Obviously not with our money\u2026. (it\u2019s worth nothing) We don\u2019t have enough gold. But we do have real estate\u2026.

TimJowers \nJosh, The money is owed to yourself and other Americans. Social Security money has been wasted and effectively funded Wall Street Bonuses this year and last year. Same for other liabilities (medicare!). So, when you portend the money will not be paid back then you are correct. The only problem is the losers are working Americans. Not Billionaires. Not Congress persons. Not the FED or their posse for sure! Fractional banking is a simple system to steal from those who produce value and give to those who control the printing press. Very simple. Very effective. (BTW, the legal limit in the UK is 666 fake credit bubble pounds to every actual pound on deposit. At least one bank made it up to 66 to 1 in 2008.) Big M \nThe debt is phony, and the people of this country didn\u2019t sign anything agreeing to pay off loans that didn\u2019t go to them. \nEach state legislature should immediately declare its independence from the brothel in DC, confiscate every military base within its borders (they paid for them, didn\u2019t they?), start their own state banks, COIN their own money, and tell the criminals in DC to pound sand. The CONstitution isn\u2019t legally binding on ANYBODY, and never has been, which means that the criminal syndicate calling itself the federal government has neither legitimacy nor legal authority. TimJowers \nHere\u2019s how I see it: Fractional banking is a simple way to steal from those who work. For every $1 you earn from working, they print $1 or so for themselves; so, no matter how hard you work, you will never get ahead. \nJosh, Its actually worse than you portend. The theft is from each American in the way of Social Security, Medicare, etc. That money has been stolen and is gone. \n\u201cFractional banking\u201d is criminal. It is a way for those who do not work to reward themselves and take from others. Imagine if you offered auto insurance to all your friends and neighbors. What if one had a wreck and asked you to pay? How is this any different than what AIG did? The difference is they control the government and can take from the taxpayers. You cannot. The same for the FED. Imagine if you borrowed money from all of your friends and family to the point you borrowed $10,000 but you only really had $100. Well, that\u2019s fractional banking. To make it worse, imagine if you never even had the $100 in the first place but your brother had given you an IOU for it \u2013 even though he himself was broke! That\u2019s how the Federal Reserve Banking System works. Its a simple con job on trusting Americans. And it has destroyed the USA. \n(The legal limit in the UK is 666 to 1. One banks was leverage 66 to 1 in 2008. They are all probably higher now since the derivatives markets are back in the stratosphere.) TimJowers \nGlenn Peters, \nDo you have any idea what GDP is? Step out of the box and think about it for a minute! GDP is a measure of \u201ctax ability\u201d NOT productiveness. I\u2019m sure you know how its components but others should look it up. Its good for a laugh and a cry.

Mockan \nThe Elites \u201csolution\u201d to this problem was always for the Elites to move their financial operations to countries that still have wealth not yet appropriated, formally dissolve the USA Constitution, dissolve USA sovereignty, and make the US military the official enforcement arm of the United Nations (that is what Elites in control of the UN have wanted to protect \u201ctheir\u201d wealth, and prevent any other countries from threatening their power and control). The actual solution is going to be global rebellion against the Elites, denial of validity of all their ownership contracts, their apprehension, and execution. All assets will be returned.

The real problem is interest. When the money supply is expanded via fractional reserve banking it creates more money to be injected into the money supply. However loans also charge interest. Only the money created for the loan contract or principal is actually distributed in the money supply. The money to pay the interest is not created in the money supply, thus creates a system of perpetual inflation. This is a lose-lose situation for the person taking the loan for not only does the amount of money in the money supply not even exist to pay off the interest, but the original loan that was taken devalues the money we already have. This means that not only are bankruptcies inevitable, but everyone is taxed subversively via inflation. OSKR \nIt\u2019s sad read about how certain people on this blog try to make others feel IGNORANT because of thier lack of knowledge on the subject.

You bargain and come to a mutual understanding of your product/service value, at the same time the product/service might be worth more/less in a different situation. But then again modern economists disagree due to inability of disregarding those \u201cmodern unified rules\u201d of value\u2026. but that\u2019s what the real barter system is about there is not prescribed value to anything you make it your own\u2026 (and actually this system has been proven by the guy who exchanged a paper pin for a house- check out this story) Bystander \nSaying money doesn\u2019t have any value is a ridiculous claim. If you really believe it i will be more than happy to come to your house and relieve you of your excess paper. The value of anything is the result of supply and demand. The demand for US dollars derives from the laws mandating they be accepted for all debt public and private. The supply results from the government putting money in circulation. Where supply and demand meet we find the value of something. Paper money has no more or less inherent value than gold or anything else. You can\u2019t eat either, both will fail in getting you to work or sheltering you or your family. There value is determined largely by the rules and mores of society. Money from our laws, and gold from the fact that people like shinny things. \nI have no problem with the Fed, actually i trust the fed alot more than i trust the (current) congress, president, and alot of people. Our problems are big, but not insurmountable. We don\u2019t have to worry about paying off the national debt immediately, instead simply balancing the budget would do alot, since with economic growth a constant nominal debt value will decrease as a percent of our economic if the economic is growing. \nThe problem is geting the economy to start growing. And in order to do that we need to create a friendly environment for business. Another tough, but not impossible thing to accomplish. Get Real \nUnited States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.

Furthermore, this discussion ignores the effect of crude oil on banking and money. A comprehensive discussion includes the effect of the petrodollar system on our currency. With that, we should include the impact of holding more crude oil within our borders than all the other proven oil reserves on earth. Here are the official estimates:\u2013 8-times as much oil as Saudi Arabia\u2013 18-times as much oil as Iraq First, investigate the Williston Basin, more commonly referred to as the \u2018Bakken.\u2019 It an area stretching from Northern Montana, through North Dakota and into Canada. It contains over 500 billion barrels of oil. Also, since 2006, it\u2019s been common knowledge in the oil industry that 1,000 feet beneath the surface of the Rocky Mountains lies the largest untapped oil reserve in the world. It holds more than 2 TRILLION barrels. On August 8, 2005 President Bush mandated its extraction. In four years of high oil prices none has been extracted and nearly all of us are unaware of its existence. These oil assets are coveted by the international banking cabal and the largest multinational industries because in a world reliant on crude oil, oil can be used as currency between nations. The size of ours guarantee global predominance. Currently the major multinational banks are colluding to take this wealth from the American citizens. They are in the process of creating a spectacular economic collapse of our fiat dollar system. With it will come a tremendous drop in our standard of living. This means more than resorting to \u201cHamburger Helper\u201d instead of filet mignon. It means increased infant mortality rates and decreased life expectancy. Afterwards we will surrender our constitutional government and our natural resources for the promise of regaining some modicum of our standard of living and relative affluence. All the while we would possess the means and the resources to pay the debts they incurred for us, enormous though they may be. Sad to say it, ladies and gentlemen, but control of our government has been taken from us and now we begin to pay the price for letting it happen. web ether-net ideas \nBystander_ why don\u2019t you then start printing your own money and see where that takes you. Any country\u2019s currency in order to have any value has to be backed up by something. That is why it is called legal tender because the idea of paper money is simply made up and works just as IOUs (of sort). When US used to have the gold standard- US currency was backed up by the gold bullion, which had value. But after president Nixon ended Brentton Woods act and eliminated gold standards US currency is backed by empty promises and the believe that US is GOOD FOR IT.

Certain people can press a few computer buttons and create hundreds of billions of dollars. If one person has the power to create hundreds of billions of dollars out of thin air, then what can the true value be? What work was done or product/service sold in order to productively create this new money? None. The value, the true value, is nonexistent. People value dollars because of faith and trust in the government which says they have value. The same government that prints the money out of thin air. \nThe difference with gold as money, the reason why the founders of the United States mandated that only gold and silver were money, is that gold or silver cannot be created out of nothing by government bureaucrats. When governments are unable to create money out of thin air then they have no choice but to live within their means. But, governments living within their means equates to less interest income for the bankers\u2026 \nAnother point about gold, it has an extremely long and successful track record as being accepted as money, for more than 5,000 years. All fiat currencies, of which the USD is, in the history of the world (aside from our current group of fiat currencies) have failed. Fiat has a very bad historical track record.

Your advantage with only a few telephone calls to some Wall Street Banks: 8,133.5 (MT; US gold reserves) x 1000 kg x 32,15 = 261,5 Million Oz. x US$ 51,000 = US 13,3 Quadrillion. Debt: Pooff, gone! \nHistory has learned to be very cynical to believe the US will have the balls to confront their problems. Most probably they will find an easy way out: bomb the problems into oblivion, let other people pay for their debt or create another paper illusion. Hetty \nIt appears to me the crisis was caused by the US, that is the Federal Reserve. What happened was that the risks were sold abroad as derivatives, so foreign banks have to suffer as well as US banks. Actually, we are in the same boat, all over the world. I don\u2019t think it is fair to let the people, whether in the US, Greece, Iceland, Portugal or wherever, suffer for the unfair system of debt creation. We need some bright ideas and political clout to get rid of this debt in the best way for the people. We know that debt is as fictional as money created by the banks, so something must be possible in this area. Frankenstein Government \nExcellent article. Pretty factual despite all of the nanny naysayers. \nTherein lies the rub. Money is illusory and does not actually exist. It is a debt instrument. As long as people \u201cbelieve\u201d the unbacked and fiat currency of the US has value-then it does. Perception is truly reality. The problem is that folks are beginning to figure this out. Like China and the Middle East. \nAbolish the voracious middle man-Federal Reserve. Print our own currency. Be a patriot. Vote libertarian. GulagCentral \nEverybody needs to get all the credit cards they can\u2026run the limit to the max and don\u2019t pay on them. Stop making mortgage payments. If you are self employed stop paying your quarterly income taxes. Of course nobody will do this because they are scared to lose their littole possessions. But if we did the country would grind to a halt pretty soon. Then see where the chips fall. Karl \nI predict we end up going the way of barter, via an unofficial currency like Argentina\u2019s credito. That, or we go back to seashells. Gold & silver are too valuable to be a currency again. We\u2019ll always have money though. Mike \nFirst, (as Get Real pointed out) the Federal Reserve and its fiat note are unconstitutional. Only congress has the power to coin money. Simple, argument over. \u201cCoin\u201d was deliberately used as the Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of paper money, and coins were used for many years. Paper bills were created to facilitate large transactions, but the bills were tied to gold redeemable at a quantity of grams of gold. The fact is, our Federal reserve not is not redeemable for anything. Nixon cut that tie. So, our money has ties only to Federal reserve assets, which consist of failed mortgage securities, to the tune of 2 trillion. \nOther countries are unloading their stockpiles of US currency for gold bullion from the IMF. Foreign banks are trying to get to 30% US currency reserves, down from 65%. \nBystander has drank the kool-aid and I am going to increase your choco rations to 30grams next week! The Fedreral reserve issues currency, not the government. Gold and silver have been used as money for thousands of years, so their established value is not in question whatsoever as a money. \nDO the smart thing and diversify some of your investments into precious metals and get in to dividend paying foreign stocks that have little to no ties to US interests. GG \nThe answer is pretty obvious, and simple\u2026. \nThe US will default on it`s debt. \nIt will probably offer to pay China/Japan/etc their parts of the debt (which I belive is actually a pretty small part of the overall debt), but the rest will be defaulted. \nThere, problems solved (and new problems created!) Ed Simple \nMe? I\u2019m renouncing my citizenship and moving to Switzerland. Jim \nI won\u2019t even begin to list the ways in which the article is dead wrong. A complete waste of time. If you\u2019re buying what this article is selling, you should look elsewhere for an education on how these systems work. The author doesn\u2019t know. Don \nOK \u2013 First of all, the FED actually creates very little money in our fractional monetary system. In normal markets there is $800 Billion of US Treasury Notes (a debit entry) that has been moneterized into Federal Reserve Notes (a credit entry). Due to the enormous one-time (hopefully) money needs stemming from the fall-out of the credit crisis, the FED has mushroomed its balance sheet to approximately $2.3 Trillion from the aforementioned $800 Billion. This quantitative easing was necessary due to interest rate considerations, not because there was not enough money. Simply put, if the US Treasury had to issue a Trillion or so more in US Treasury Notes overnight, the interest rates would have sky-rocketed which would have put the chances for a recovery into the remote range. Moreover, the author implies that the FED is controlled a group of elites that and are absconding the money they make. This is only remotely true. The FED is independent of the US Government, so politics stay out of the banking sector. Moreover, the great majority of the money generated investments on the FED\u2019s books from US Treasuries, and now, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac paper is simply given back to the US Treasury. If that was not the case, you can be certain the Bernanke would not be re-appointed as FED Chairman by a vote of Congress. \nSecondly, the majority of our money is created when banks make loans. When a banker makes a loan, he must retain a capital ratio of around 8%. My sense is that the author is inter-changably treating this 8% requirement as the approximate 10% reserve requirement that the FED has in place. When a bank makes a new loan it is debit on its books and the credit is a deposit into the borrowers account. Somebody has to clarify to me how money has been lost in this transaction. Say the loan is for $100,000\u2026 well, $100,000 is credited to the borrower, so how there a loss of 10%? When you borrow $100,000 from a bank, do you only receive $90,000 as the author seems to be implying? For EVERY DEBIT on the books, there is an equal CREDIT, unless the loan is not paid back. Of course, that is why an 8% capital requirement is in place, so that the loan loss can safely be offset against the bank\u2019s capital. \nThirdly, the money supply is tight right now because banks have been contracting their balance sheets. This is being done by tightening credit standards. When less credit is being issued by banks a contraction in the macro money supply occurs. Likewise, when banks make loans, their balance sheets are made larger on both the asset and liability side (deposits or money) of their books and the macro money supply is expanded. \nFourthly, part of the reason that the macro money supply is not expanding is due to loans losses that banks are taking due to the lack of supervision regarding the subprime debacle. When banks lose money, they very naturally become hesitant to make news loans that could result in further losses. Moreover, the loan loss means they have less capital and will have trouble maintaining the 8% capital requirement if they continue to make more loans, thereby expanding their balance sheet. A natural contraction occurs. That is what the FED is trying to partially offset by expanding its balance sheet, so the whole system does not implode. However, in context of the entire money supply, an extra Trillion on the FED\u2019s balance sheet is relative peanuts. \nFifthly, the real threat to the US\u2019s money supply is trade imbalances. When the US imports more goods and services than it exports, the difference is made up by selling them our debt. Again, all the money created via the fractional monetary system has a debit and a credit\u2026 they equal. However, when foreigners end up owning our money because we traded it for goods and services, we do end up with less domestic money than we have debt. And, if that money does not eventually come back to the US in the form of trade surpluses we will not have enough money to pay our domestic debt with. However, the money did not somehow disappear. The debits still equal the credits. The problem is the foreigners have become our creditor and we are the debtors. \nSixthly, debt based monetary systems are inherently dependent upon the money continuing to circulate. When people become scared and start hording money instead of keeping a healthy amount of it in circulation, there will be a lack of money to service debt. It is not unwise to save money, but when the macro savings rate is high enough to result in a contraction of economic activity, we will have a debt servicing issue. RIPITUP \nGET REAL \nIt may be legal tender. But under the US Constitution it IS NOT legal MONEY. So what two things are legal money under the constitution of the USA? steadystevs \nA little at a time, the American public has been decieved into thinking that worthless paper is \u201cmoney\u201d.

Admin \nJust look at how much trouble they are having just trying to get an audit of the Federal Reserve right now\u2026. Glenn Peters \nTim Jowers \nYes, I\u2019ve quite aware of what constitutes GDP. You might be surprised to know just how GDP is calculated in your country (I\u2019m not an American BTW). Did you know that if you earn $100 and then spend that $100, your national accounts show GDP to be $200? But I digress. The point of my response is the the basis of the original article is deeply flawed, by virtue of comparing existing debt (which is repaid over time) with only one year\u2019s GDP. The issue is that the internet is overflowing with \u2018experts\u2019 who for the most part gain their knowledge from web-sites and unattributed statements from others who are equally ignorant. The statements then get parroted by others and become conventional \u2018wisdom\u2019. Just because experts disagree doesn\u2019t mean every Tom, Dick or Harry\u2019s argument is equally valid. Just look at some of the rambling, incoherent, conspiracy-theory laden responses here; Dennen\u2019s reponse being a great case in point. People, get an education, read BOOKS not just damn web-sites and don\u2019t believe every so-called \u2018expert\u2019 who trots out a bunch of stuff that seems to sound right. Anon \nThe only solution is to go back to the gold standard. We don\u2019t necessarily have to use gold, but there has to be some sort of physical asset that we can use as the cap for how much we can spent. That way if we need to pay back our debts, we can use the gold (or whatever assets the standard is based off) to pay back that debt. Simple, efficient, tolerable. oldtimer \nThis article is ridiculous, or has a different definition of \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d than a mathematician does. As one example: \nYou see, the truth is that the U.S. government now owes more dollars than actually exist. \nAnd when the US Gov\u2019t pays a dollar towards reducing its debt, does that dollar get removed from circulation? \nOf course not, it *circulates*. It\u2019s what happens to money in an economy. Bronco \nSo, the question that puzzles me is \u2013 why China is giving us the money instead giving it to its own people whose living standard is way lower then ours? Danno Alex \nPeople do not want gold because it is a \u201cshiny object\u201d\u2026and no, you cannot \u201ceat your gold\u201d! \nWhat gold is is a store of value. While there is some fluctuation in true value due to the occurrence of a depleted vein of ore, the most common reason that the price goes up or down in any given period is due to the strength (or weakness)of the paper currency used to buy it. \nI bought a certain number of gold American Eagles (1 oz. each) when the spot price of gold was under $300/oz \u2013 Oh, how I wish I had mortgaged the house and bought MORE! The spot price for 1 oz. American Eagles closed at $1121.50. My return in approximately 10 years would have been around 400%! Top THAT, Wall Street! \nBut I didn\u2019t buy it for speculation \u2013 I bought it to PRESERVE the money I worked hard for. \nIf the economy crashes and your beloved Federal Reserve Note becomes as worthless as a German Deutchmark between the years 1917-1921, you will see the folly of keeping your wealth in paper dollars! \nNo, you can\u2019t spend gold at the hardware store or at Wal-Mart but when the dust clears and a new currency replaces the failed one, I have enough gold to buy all the Amero\u2019s or Euro\u2019s or whatever currency I will need. \nWhen people refer to people who hold this mindset as being \u201cgold bugs\u201d, you can rest assured those people probably make money by peddling paper \u201cinvestments\u201d. \nSo what\u2019ll it be? Value based on a metal that requires labor and investment in order to be extracted out of the ground? (And has been prized as true wealth since before Biblical times?) Or value based on printed paper. Something that a private group of elite bankers manipulate the value of? \nChoose wisely! Kate Jensen \nIt is clear that the first step is to stop any additional debt. The boat is almost full of water, stop the increase so a plan can be made to reduce what is already in. As people can not find jobs and have time on their hands bartering will become more common, they will trade work or items for things of survival. Neal \n\u201cThe Federal Reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers.\u201d \nAm I missing something here? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_reserve says that the Fed is not owned and is not private and is not for profit, which is what I recollected. \nThis destroys the credibility of the article for me. woot \nyou have just enough info to be dangerous \u2013 try to increase your rational thought. \none quick point because i\u2019m in a hurry: \nsaying it\u2019s \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d is a misnomer. if you have no money for deposit (but a good job) and buy a $30k car with a loan, (as soon as you buy it the car is worth $20k or less), so you have a $30k debt and now only $20k in assests. is that \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d to repay? no. you promise to pay it with your _future earnings_, which is what the entire debt system is based on. \nthis completely refutes your point 2: #2) The only way to create more money is to go into even more debt which makes the problem even worse. \nno, the other way is to _work off the debt_. luckily, the government is spending on infrastructure and education so the people will be able to produce enough to pay off that debt. oops, sorry, no, they\u2019re spending on wars. my bad. \nthe issue isn\u2019t debt, it\u2019s what you spend the money on! Rampart \nDear \u201cBystander\u201d\u2013 gold has been money for 5,000 years. It is a reliable store of wealth because it can\u2019t be printed out of thin air. If you think fiat currency is as good as gold, I refer you to recent events in Zimbabwe and Argentina. Good luck holding on to your bits of printed paper\u2026 perhaps you can use your FRN\u2019s for building fires like this woman from the Weimar Republic. \nPS \u2013 the \u201cdemand\u201d for federal reserve notes came as a result of the Breton Woods agreement. At the time that document was penned, our dollars were in fact backed by gold. Since abandoning the gold standard, foreign governments have little reason to hold the FRN in reserve. Mark \nIncorrect. Interest payments are about 4% of GDP. Kick that up to 5% of GDP and the debt would be paid off over time. \n\u201cYou see, the truth is that the U.S. government now owes more dollars than actually exist\u201d \nThat is the nature of debt: there is always more debt than money, except in very primitive economies. Even on the gold standard that was true. John Sawyer \nThe government can still issue money in the form of coins. Maybe we should all pay for things with a lot of loose change! PleaseExpalin \nGlenn Peters , \nNo-one has answered my question above. You seem very knowledgeable. Would you like to answer my question please? \nThe article says \n\u201c We could solve this problem by shutting down the Federal Reserve and restoring the power to issue U.S. currency to the U.S. Congress. But the politicians in Washington D.C. are not about to do that. \u201d \nMy question is \nIf it does solve this problem, so why do we not do that? Is there any real practical problem with that, or is it just an ideological issue? 3-D \nThere is no way to fix it now and no way out. The best solution is to hunker down, let it all burn down around you as social disorder asserts itself, and try to come out alive. If you do, you\u2019ll be a part of rebuilding the country, this time hopefully NOT under control of bankers with specific unchangeable parts of the Constitution that EXPLICITLY FORBID handing the money supply over to private banks of any kind. David Smith \nJFK has already signed an Executive Order for the issue of debt free Treasury Notes and the Notes were printed and ready to go into circulation when he was killed. His Executive Order is still legally in effect but no one has had the courage since then to implement it. Immediately after they killed him, and he was not the 1st President to be killed for this reason, the newly printed Treasury Notes were destroyed. The President we now have like many before him are owned by the owners of the Federal Reserve (House of Rothschild) or their agents (George Soros etc.). If these people finally get kicked out of our country and the chance is slim because the American People will probably never understand or care about the financial system since these very same people control our minds using many methods but mainly through television, they will probably remotely militarily destroy what little remains of our economy, society, and country that they were not able to destroy while here. They will destroy it out of vengeance and desperation because it is their nature to destroy. The U.S.A. is not the only country they control against the will of the majority of it\u2019s people. They hate the U.S. Constitution because it is based on God\u2019s Laws and because we have been a Christian society. Still though, I believe that forgiving them for destroying us physically is the right thing to do. I\u2019m not sure though if I will be able to follow through on my belief if some day I find my back up against a wall. It seems like that day is quickly approaching for most of us. Why do all of the JFK documentaries present every possibility of who did it to confuse but none ever mention this one fact? Brophanity \n@web ether-net ideas \nyour ideations of a barter system are ok, but it really doesnt make sense to \u201ctrade\u201d anything. If you just gave people what they needed from what you were producing, and they just gave to you as needed from what they produced, things would be a lot easier. If you understand there is no real need for money, then it shouldnt be a big stretch to see that people would be happier if they only took what was necessary, and then only more than that as long as it didnt deprive others Glenn Peters \nPleaseExpalin asked: \nDoes shutting down down the Federal Reserve and restoring the power to issue U.S. currency to the U.S. Congress solve this problem, if so why do we not do that?

All Of These Wildly Divergent Surveys Cannot Possibly Be Correct Michael On Television What Is The Best Place To Live In The United States To Prepare For The Coming Economic Collapse?   May 2nd, 2011 \nWhat is the best place to live in the United States? I get asked that question all the time. My answer can be summed up in two words: it depends. The truth is that the answer is going to be different for each person. All of us have different goals and different needs. If you have a very strong network of family and friends where you live right now, you might want to think twice before moving hundreds or thousands of miles away. If you have a great job where you live right now, you might want to hold on to it. You should not just assume that you are going to be able to pick up and move to another part of the country and be able to get a similar job right away. The United States is in the midst of a very serious economic decline right now, and wherever you live you are going to have to provide for your family. Just because you move somewhere new does not mean that you are going to leave your problems behind. In fact, you might find that they moved right along with you. With all that being said, the reality is that there are some places in the U.S. that are going to be much more desirable than others when the economy totally falls apart. For example, during a total economic collapse it will not be good to be living in a large city or in a densely populated area. Just think about what happened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. If the entire nation is going through something like that, you don\u2019t want to have hundreds of thousands of close neighbors at that point. So when thinking about where you want to be when everything falls apart, population density should be a major factor. But there are other factors as well and no area of the United States is perfect. \nIf you live in or near a major city right now, that is okay. Most Americans do. Even if you have limited financial resources at the moment, you can start developing a plan that will get you where you eventually want to go. If you want to move to another part of the country you can start applying for jobs out there. You can also be working hard to develop a business that would enable you to move. Perhaps you have friends or family in more isolated areas that would allow you to stay with them during an economic collapse. \nThose that possess more financial resources could start thinking about getting a second home in a location that is more rural. \nThe key is to come up with a plan and to be working towards accomplishing that plan. \nIf you don\u2019t have a plan yet, hopefully the following information will give you something to think about. Not all areas of the United States are equal, and all of them do have problems. \nThe following are some thoughts about the best place to live in the United States\u2026. \nThe Northeast \nA major problem with the Northeast is that it is just so darn crowded. Yes, there are some rural areas, but the overall population density of the region is so high that it would be really hard to go unnoticed for long in the event of a major economic collapse. \nAnother thing that is not great about the Northeast is that so much of the population lives near the coast. As we saw in Japan recently, living near a coastline is not necessarily a good thing. While it is likely safer to live along the east coast then the west coast, the truth is that there is an inherent level of insecurity when it comes to living in coastal areas. You never know when the next hurricane, oil spill or tsunami is going to strike. \nAlso, the Northeast is really quite cold. So staying warm and growing your own food would be more difficult than in some other areas of the country. \nThe Mid-Atlantic \nThe Mid-Atlantic is one of the most beautiful areas of the nation. Unfortunately, it suffers from many of the same problems that the Northeast does. \nThe Mid-Atlantic has a very high population density. For example, the area around Washington D.C. is pretty much all suburbs for 50 miles in all directions. \nThe weather is nicer than in the Northeast and there are some less dense areas once you get south of Washington D.C. \nIf you think that the Mid-Atlantic might be for you, you might want to check out North Carolina or South Carolina. The people tend to get friendlier the further south you go and there are definitely some areas that could potentially work. \nFlorida \nFlorida is generally not going to be a place that you want to be during an economic collapse. The housing market has absolutely collapsed down there and the crime rate is already very high. It is also very densely populated. \nThe weather is very nice down in Florida, but one big thing that you need to consider when it comes to Florida is the fact that it is very flat and most of Florida is just barely above sea level. In fact, quite a bit of Florida is actually below sea level. \nIn addition, hurricanes are always a major threat in Florida. It is a beautiful state, but there is a lot of risk to living down there. \nThe Southeast \nThe Southeast has really taken a pounding over the last few years. First it was Hurricane Katrina, and then it was the BP oil spill and then it was the tornadoes of 2011 . \nThere is a lot of poverty in that area of the country. There is also a lot of crime. \nThere are a lot of great people who live down in the Southeast, but if you do not know your way around it can be a very difficult place to move to. \nThe Mid-South \nOne of my favorite places east of the Mississippi River are the mountains along the Tennessee/North Carolina border. If you must be in the eastern half of the United States, that is not a bad choice. \nWhere you do not want to be is anywhere near the New Madrid fault zone . The New Madrid fault zone covers portions of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. The biggest earthquakes in the history of the United States were caused by the New Madrid fault. Many are convinced that we are going to see an absolutely catastrophic earthquake along the New Madrid fault at some point. \nSo if you want to live in the Mid-South, it is highly recommended that you stay far away from the New Madrid fault zone. \nThe Upper Midwest \nThe Upper Midwest was once one of the great manufacturing regions of the world, but now much of it is known as the \u201crust belt\u201d. \nFormerly great manufacturing cities such as Detroit are now absolute hellholes . Tens of thousands of our factories and millions of our jobs have been shipped overseas. \nThere are some really great people (including some good friends of this column) that live up there, but the truth is that the region is really cold and unemployment is rampant. \nThe Upper Midwest is an area that people want to get out of. It is probably not a great place to move to. \nHowever, if you do need a job, one place to look is a little bit west of there. Thanks to an abundance of natural resources, unemployment in North Dakota and South Dakota is very low. If you really need a job you might want to look into those two states. \nThe Southwest \nIn the Southwest there are a whole lot of freedom-loving Americans, the weather is very warm and there is a lot of space to get lost. \nHowever, the Southwest is also very dry and in many areas there is not a lot of water. Drought and wildfires are quite common. \nIn addition, illegal immigration is rampant and is a constant security threat. \nIf you are familiar with that area of the country it is not a bad choice, but if you do not know what you are doing it could end up being disastrous for you. \nThe Great Plains \nAs long as you are far enough away from the New Madrid fault, the Great Plains is not a bad choice. \nIt is very, very flat out there, and it can be quite windy, but the good news is that you should be able to grow your own food. \nIn addition, the population density is generally very low in most areas. \nOne big negative, as we have seen recently, is tornadoes. The United States experiences more tornadoes that anywhere else in the world, and \u201ctornado alley\u201d generally gets the worst of it. \nThe West Coast \nDuring an economic collapse, the West Coast is not a place that you will really want to be. Just take a look at the state of California already. It is an economic nightmare . \nMillions of people have left California over the past couple of decades. The millions of people that have left have been replaced mostly with illegal aliens. \nOregon is better, although they have very high taxes and they are experiencing huge economic problems right now as well. \nThe best area along the West Coast is the Seattle area, but you won\u2019t want to be anywhere near a major population center when things totally fall apart. \nAlso, the West Coast lies along the \u201c Ring of Fire \u201c. Considering what just happened in Japan and what has been happening in other areas along the Ring of Fire lately, the West Coast is not an area that a lot of people are recommending. \nThe Northwest \nLarge numbers of freedom-loving Americans have been moving to the states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. You can also throw eastern Washington and eastern Oregon into this category as well. \nIt gets cold up in the Northwest, but not as cold as the Upper Midwest. There are lots of rivers, streams and lakes and in certain areas there is plenty of rain. \nThe population density is very low in most areas and there is an abundance of wildlife. Housing prices are reasonable and in many areas you can grow your own food. \nThe Northwest is one of the favorite areas of the United States for preppers. It is far from perfect, but it does have a lot of advantages. \nAlaska And Hawaii \nNeither Alaska or Hawaii is recommended. Alaska lies along the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d and it is very, very cold. Also, almost everything has to be either shipped or flown into Alaska. In the event of a real economic collapse, supplies to Alaska could be cut off and shortages could develop very quickly. \nHawaii has a huge population and it does not have a lot of room. Like Alaska, most supplies have to be either shipped in or flown in. And one really bad tsunami could pretty much wipe Hawaii out. \nBut once again, there is no \u201cright answer\u201d. There are areas of just about every U.S. state that could potentially work well during a major economic collapse. \nWhen assessing where \u201cthe best place to live in the United States\u201d is, it is important to examine your own personal factors. What will work for me and for my family will not necessarily work for you and your family. \nSo what do all of you think about this list? Which area of the country do you think is best for those Americans who are seeking to prepare themselves for the coming economic collapse? Scott \nI have actually been thinking about this lately. And population and weather are the two biggest factors. emma \nThis whole Osama dead Stuff really gets to me. \nThe guy from FFT summed it up perfectly. \nhttp://www.forecastfortomorrow.com/news/2011/05/osama-bin-laden-dead/ \nNever before has this country embraced Empire so willingly. Never before have we given up, wholesale, our precious liberties won with the blood of our countrymen. For what?? Some lame ass guy in a cave somewhere that represents some of the best thinking of the 13th Century? This is beyond ridiculous, it is totally absurd. Nickelthrower \nGreetings, \nI can\u2019t help but laugh when I read blogs such as this. I hate to break it to everyone but no place is going to be very safe. Hear me out then see if you don\u2019t agree. \nIf the economic tsunami that is headed our way includes the loss of international oil then it wont matter if you are in New York City or the Deep South. \nWe now know (because we have their documents) what the Soviet Union planned to do to destroy the U.S.A. Whereas we intended to nuke everything and anything in an attempt to kill as many Russians as possible, the Russians believed that they could kill even more Americans by just using a few dozen or so nukes on a few of our ports and all of our major oil refineries. \nWhere we planned to annihilate everyone in every major city in the Soviet Union, they figured that they could kill even more Americans by just shutting off the oil. They knew that the loss of oil would cause pandemonium in the U.S.A and that the starving people would spill out of the cities and eat up everything until there was nothing left and no means to grow or obtain any more. \nLet me reiterate it again for you just to make sure you got it: The loss of oil brought about by the collapse of the dollar will be more devastating than a nuclear holocaust. \nWhatever little \u201cAlamo\u201d you set up for yourself in Hillbilly Land wont be so much as a speed bump when thousands of hungry people descend upon it. \nDo a little research and read about what a famine of biblical proportions looks because that is what will go down when the pumps go dry. shawn \nThat was pretty interesting and it make since. It actually just reinforces the conclusion I have drawn. N. Dakota is the place I think I am gonna move my family to as soon as I can.Its gonna take people a while to run outta the major cities into n. Dakota as there are no major cities close in any direction.This would give N. Dakota plenty of time to prepare. N. Dakota has it\u2019s own state bank.It also has nuclear war heads stationed there and if the people and local authorities could seize control of them it would go a long way in defending itself from a tyrannical federal government. It has an abundance of oil and agriculture. Also, it is the state that could most easily succeed from the union (even more likely than Texas) as technically it never really was properly admitted into the union. It is cold and flat but that has kept the wrong kind of people away. N. Dakota also has 0 debt and did not take federal bail out money so they have the right mentality and they already want to succeed. Missy \nThat was an excellent article Michael!! You are such an excellent writer. I am really looking forward to the comments that will be left on this article. The middle of the US is certainly one of the safer places to live. VegasBob \nThe Central and Eastern areas of Washington State are actually a fairly nice place to be. The people are generally friendly, and they are far less judgmental than Southerners (I am a native Southerner, so I know just how judgmental Southerners can be). The trouble is that there is not a lot of cultural stuff going on \u2013 symphonies, museums, theatres, etc. Maria \nWe have lived in many different states over the last 25 years from Alaska and Hawaii in the west to Virginia in the east and Texas in the south. We are convinced you are right\u2026there is no perfect place. People need to decide which drawbacks they are most capable of dealing with (snow, rain, heat, earthquakes, etc) and plan accordingly. \nIf it gets much worse economically, one thing will be certain\u2026if you can\u2019t protect what you have, then you won\u2019t have it for very long. \nI pray it doesn\u2019t get that bad. Pat \nI live in Alaska and just got back from vacationing down south. Alaska may be cold and hostile, but one thing it has going for it is stability \u2013 something I\u2019ve noticed the lower 48 has been lacking lately. If you know how to live in cold-weather environments, Alaska ain\u2019t a bad choice. Gutter Economist \nPeople need to start thinking about what comes after the economic collapse. I would look for states that are rich in natural resources and away from coastal areas. \nIf we have a civil war, I would like to see the following states pull out the union and become the Mountain States of America. With respect to natural resources, these states might include Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. If residents of these states were smart, they would pull out of the union ASAP. Hognutz \nI\u2019m staying right here on my farm in good old S.C. \nOne thing not mentioned is family support and real friends. If you have them you might be better off with them\u2026.. karl \nYellowstone Patty \nMy husband and I saw this coming over 12 years ago as we were living in Florida. With crime, drugs and homeless people all around us. We looked at Tennessee but it just wasn\u2019t right for us. We ended up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I notice more than not that when people think of Michigan they ALWAYS think Detroit. Evidenced once again in your article. The UP is the land of God so to speak with great natural resources, good and plentiful water and lots and lots of land. The people up here are resourceful and know how to live off the land. Yes it\u2019s cold and I like it that way because it discourages the type of people that all southern and warm states have too many of\u2026\u2026\u2026. shawn \namen J \nIf you are willing to work abroad there are many countries where you can teach English. Just get the CELTA. It\u2019s a four week English teaching certificate. Here are a few sites that list ESL teaching jobs abroad: \nhttp://www.teachaway.com \nI am a U.S. citizen and I am currently teaching physics in Saudi Arabia with a lot of expats from all over the west. Many teachers here have purchased property abroad since the cost of living is cheaper like Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. \nPlease go to http://www.trulia.com because you will find many inexpensive property listings all over the U.S. there. There are some great property listings in the Portland, Oregon area. \nI hope this helps. Owen \nLike the old gospel song proclaims \u201cThere\u2019s no hiding place down here.\u201d Your preparatins will be in vain if you disregard this truth. The time is short aa it appears to this reader that we have now entered the beginning of sorrows. Just Me \nother than the northwest, I\u2019ll still stick with Pa or Central NY, it gets a little cold and there is some snow, but we don\u2019t have to worry about forest fires, earth quakes,floods, tornadoes,hurricanes,Tsunamies,mud slides,poison snakes,scorpions,alligators,fresh water,very few draughts,burning heat waves,high moisture. and there won\u2019t be very many roving bandits from Sept til June. Wood Burner \nMost people who live on the Great Plains have only seen a tornado on the weather channel. The damage done by twisters is very localized and narrow. Most assuredly not a factor in determining whether to locate there or not. \nAlso, using possibles like the New Madrid fault as a factor in where to locate is like using the possibility of zombie rabbits popping up. There is just no certainty of any event like a huge earthquake occurring in the center of the U.S. Mathematically it can not even be an issue. \nWhat can be stated with certainty is the fact that when the SHTF you will not want to be in or near a large city of any kind. There the possibility of encountering zombie criminals of the human type is not only high but virtually assured. One can make preparations but how does one keep the provisions from being taken by starving idiots? You can try to defend your position but the numbers are against you. \nUltimately there is only one way anybody gets out of this life with a chance of redemption. Use it. Rev 6:5 \nI think the best place to go in the event of a economic collapse or something much worse would be out in Utah. Most of Utah is isolated except around Salt Lake City. The weather isnt that bad in winter but summers can get hot in the southern half of the state. I would definetly recommend living near a water source such as a lake or river. There are places around Fruita, UT that grow crops out in the middle of the desert because of the Freemont River. Living in the mountains would be fine in the summer but they can recieve a lot of snow and cold from October to May. Utah just seems to me to be the most practical location. Matt \nIt must be warm year round. Southwest wins here. Summer heat is very uncomfortable but extreme cold is much worse if you cannot afford the high cost of heating or cooling your home. J \nAnother good thing about living and teaching abroad is that you don\u2019t have to pay taxes. Just file the 2555-EZ form. jet \nI would pass on Oregon and Washington. The taxes are incredibly high, there is always the threat of tsunami or earthquake and it rains or is cloudy for about nine months a year, people are in a constant state of depression because of the weather. Oh, and it is liberal in the extreme. People here don\u2019t like \u201cfreedom loving Americans\u201d, aka conservatives. Freedom Lover \nMontana, Idaho and Wyoming depends if you are in one of the wolf high population areas you could not pick a worst area. Wildlife is being slaughtered off in record numbers. Ranchers forced out of business that milk cow and chickens for survival would be close to impossible to raise. Now the wolves are spreading disease to the animals and people. Before you even think of moving to one of these 3 States you should watch Yellowstone is Dead. \nWhere ever you pick make sure you have your own well water is going to be very important and you truly can\u2019t store enough water. Massivecarbunkle \nEveryone must find a place, surely most will want to be near blood relatives, those who grew up in the 80\u2019s when the media taught them to be independent and far from home, they will find it very hard, very, very, hard indeed. Most strangers in places they are not familiar with during the economic collapse will be dissed and treated very harsh and left for dead by city dwellers. For this was the GREAT SIN of the citizens of Sodom and Gomorrah, the wicked and cruel treatment of strangers. jose puta \nthe best place for you to live is on the Amazon with the tribes, quit spreading your disease. JH \nThere are some great areas in California along the Sierra Mountain range and in Northern California. They are warm most the year, have very fertile soil for gardening, low population density, natural beauty and water sources (off the mountains). Yes, taxes and property rates are high and employment is tough, but if you can work from home or are retired, not a bad option. \nSouthern Colorado in the Rockies is another good option with limited government, cheap land, low population density, water sources, few gun laws, etc. It gets cold, but not as cold as other places. Judith \nYou are forgetting the Yellowstone volcano. That should pretty much take care of the Northwest. Adrian \nI noticed lately that more Americans are moving to Australia. We have plenty of rooms and we love Americans. So come on over. Gary2 \nWe have a large body of fresh water on our door step. Lake MI looks as big as any ocean from the shore line. Please keep telling people to not move here (WI) as I hate crowds and a lot of people clogging up everything. The cold keeps the nasty bugs at bay. If you need a well you can pretty much sink a hole anywhere and get wonderful water. With water shortages we are positioned quite well. Steve \nEconomic collapse? Do you really know how the collapse will happen? How about a Mexico border state like TX, NM or AZ. Start a garden. In a rural area a little south of a big city. Learn spanish and have a little vacation home in Mexico to escape to with a Peso bank account. Keep your van packed ready to run. Would love to have a little Wine and Coffee plantation near the Mexican town of Chicxulub in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula run by a bunch of nice se\u00f1oritas. InArizona \nI think you are wrong about Alaska, there are many places in Alaska that are WARMER than the Northwest in the Winter. Anywhere along the water is more temperate than the Northern part of the Cont US. Also, Alaska has abundant LARGE game, fish, and other resources that no other state does. Forget about shipments up there, what would you need? Lumber is available, oil, and nat gas are everywhere\u2026 Not to mention\u2026 the VERY long growing days in the summer produce some of the largest fruits and vegatables\u2026. just take a look at the Palmer Fair each fall\u2026 Also, tidal waves, volcanos are an issue as well as earthquakes, but just living away from low lying coastal areas would mitigate that threat. One thing about Alaska\u2026 you NEVER have to worry about a drought! So summertime will produce plenty of vegatables\u2026 wheat and grains don\u2019t work so well, but I have been successful growing corn, risky and a lot of work, but it can be done. \nI think that as a human being you would find most of the resources you need up there, without the competition for resources, which needs to be taken into consideration. \nSo, my short answer, it depends on how BAD it gets, Alaska would be perfect WTSHTF! InArizona \njust so you know, I currently live in Arizona, and am originally from Alaska\u2026 born and raised, been in AZ for 10 years now. \nI can see advantages to both places to live, but I really worry about water here, and the availability of game animals. I am also out of my element, so when I go into survival mode, I am thinking about Alaska. \nHere in the desert all we have is bunnies and cacti\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to build a home from cacti, and eating those darn bunnies would eventually get very old! (I currently have moose meat and smoked salmon in my freezer\u2026you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can\u2019t take the trailer park out of the girl!) tobage \nRural Southwestern Michigan \nThe Great Lakes area is the Saudi Arabia of freshwater in general, but SW Mich has some of the most fertile land on Earth\u2026AND a 180 day growing season\u2026that will only be getting longer thanks to abrupt climate shift. \nExtremely few places on planet Earth have this. \nAnd THIS\u2026\u2026 is all that will matter. \nI bet thats why you are sterring people away. wink wink\u2026 foldenfan \nWe are in west central Minnesota, and feel pretty good about our area. Yes, it has cold winters (though the summers are the best I have ever seen), but as has been said about the cold winters, \u201cIt helps keep the riff-raff out.\u201d We have lived in Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and have a lot of experience with Wyoming and Montana. We feel this is the safest place for us. \nGardening for food here is great, good soil, adequate rain, growing season is such that if we can\u2019t grow it, we don\u2019t need it. Lots of cattle (dairy & beef) in our area, low population, and the people are of the best overall quality we have seen anywhere. Main farm crops here are corn, wheat, oats, hay, barley,soybeans, potatoes, flax, sugar beets, etc. \nAverage folks here are conservative (most of the Libs are in the cities), and well armed. As for wildlife, we have lots of deer, turkey, pheasant are making a comeback, and thousands of lakes for fishing. Also have some wolves, coyotes, and a few bear around. \nWe feel that when Teotwaki hits we will have as good a chance here as anywhere. \nLand is relatively inexpensive compared to most regions that have \u201cusable\u201d land. We have 80 acres, 50 in Oak trees (LOT\u2019s of excellent firewood), and 30 open for gardens and fields. I will admit that land is more expensive now than when we bought back in 1997. Overall, we\u2019ve been here 20+ years so we have considerable experience in this area. Gist of my comment is, don\u2019t sell parts of MN and the eastern Dakotas short. Marlene Spence \nSan Juan Capistrano California is beautiful. We grow vegetables, etc. and have survival food purchased from Jim Bakker Ministries. We do have a nuclear plant near by, however. I think Nuclear Plants need to be considered. JD \nThank you Michael. I still know Montana is far perfect but when the weather is nice like it is today this truly is the last best place. Except for Yellowstone. But you cant think that its going to blow up everyday it would make you insane. Michael \nWhen Yellowstone goes, it will generally be better to be north and west of it rather than east and south of it. JD \nOh some good news I might be able to get my old job back after getting laid off two years ago. I would be happier than i have been in a long time. I pray and i believe it will happen. Everyone reading this blog there is hope out there. Im glad its here for all of us to share our thoughts. Home is what you make of it. Like Michael was saying about using your family and connections where you live is important. It may be your only hope. I grateful even tho im techincally homeless and my friend lets me use his computer the weather is getting nicer Bin Laden is dead today is awesome. I love MT & i totally agree with gutter econonmist that Rocky Mt States of America will happen. Eastern OR & Spokane could join just as long as not too many hippies invade here. Ooops I guess theres Missoula too late.. morpheus \nI know it seems like our only choice is to retreat and run for the hills. Big mistake! Because soon everyone will follow.

A Republic, a form of government where 99% can\u2019t vote away the rights of 1%. Kevin \nRegardless if there is a collapse or not it would be wise to live where there would be jobs in gainful private sector employment. Those states with significant shale natural gas deposits and farming would be the best bet. Even if your not directly working in either field there are support jobs that come along for the ride. Small town western Pennsylvania may be a choice. Pennsylvania is Philadelphia and Pittsburg with West Virginia in the middle. Once out of the damn few cities the place is Maybury RFD. Thinkaboutit \nGlad you recommended against Hawaii, because there are plenty of people there\u2026but Tsunami only affects the coast\u2026there are great higher elevation places to live in Hawaii where the food falls out of trees along with fresh rainwater nearly every night ryan \ni live in rural western wa and its not as liberal as one would think.most all libs live in seattle and the other bigger citys on the coast but every where out side of that is good old americans!everybody i no are gun owners on a large scale to say in the long run that we will be overrun by starving people after the callapse is nonsense we will fort up and protect ourselves and are familys and friends!besides most will be killed by mobbs or will starve before they can even try to get out of the city. people underestimate us country folk! smarter than you \nEureka, California is the best place you can possibly live. Don\u2019t argue with me. Just get your ass to Eureka. Thomas \nHawaii seems a good choice. Plenty of military around to help keep order and a preferred place for Asian visitors. Even as everything has to be flown or shipped in, the state is small and can be managed easier than larger states. Old Red (neck) \nPick Colorado or Utah, or maybe western Nebraska.

It is the west side of the state that has most of the population (think Seattle) and the rain. East of the Cascades is much better for the things we\u2019re talking about -plenty of water, decent growing season, lots of wildlife (animals not bars)and fishing. Yes there\u2019s snow, but that clears out the \u201csnow birds\u201d who won\u2019t make it anyway in a big catastrophe. It also makes for a lot of fun during the winter months with skiing, snowshoeing, etc. Good luck everybody. DJ \nI live in Alaska. Moved heree from Kentucky because of all the people. I have acclimated to the environment now. Coal is on top of the ground in places and trees are abundant, I have a wood/coal burning stove in my log home. Its warm, I am oof the grind and I live at least 100 miles from the nearest population base of any size. \nHeirloom seeds, my own well, two years of dehydrated food and I am a fire arms instructor with lots of instructional equipment\u2026. Just like home. And if I am a Hillbilly then so be it. I will make it. Rod \nNot mentioned but should be considered is proximity to nuclear power plants. I wouldn\u2019t want to be within 50 miles downwind from one. Another good point about a northern climate is food storage is easier and pests can be less bothersome than a southern climate. Ben Dover \nI read the article with an open mind and came away with the thought that the author is of the opinion that all 300 million of us are doomed and should just eat a bullet\u2026it\u2019s why i do not often read this stuff\u2026common sense, it ain\u2019t common\u2026 mondobeyondo \nBut be warned, stock up on potatoes. Potatoes don\u2019t grow well out here in the desert. Don J \nRight. No perfect place, but I feel that where we live (East Texas) is perfect for us, primarily because my brothers and I inherited over 1,000 acres. We have lakes with fish, tillable garden/crop areas including areas close to our water wells, there are wild hogs that populate the area that are delicious and deer. We can butcher our own meat and cook it over hardwood fires, in an oven or deep fried. We can raise just about any vegetable and most fruit. We know how to prepare and can veggies and fruit. Not too sure how to can meat, but I feel that we could always have fresh meat either with fish, wild hog, or venison in season. There\u2019s no closed season on hogs. We have generators to keep our freezers going and house powered. We have diesel and gasoline stored in overhead tanks. We have guns and bullets and the ability to reload hunting and handgun rounds. Have we thought of everything? Probably not, but if we have to, we think we could survive some very hard times, if it comes to pass. I wish everyone the best. DJ Tom Hallett \nWhile the mid-atlantic does indeed have its share of exposed coastline, you failed to mention the very rural Susquehanna basin. \nFrom southeastern Pennsylvania to northeastern Maryland, the Susquehanna basin is quite rural, lush, and teeming with food on hoof and fin. \nThanks for keeping our little secret! Big Dave \nI live in Central Texas which is greener than most people think. Water has always been a concern, but now that I am collecting thousands of gallons off my roof I don\u2019t worry about it. Nothing tastes better. The freedoms we have in Texas are great and I know because I grew up in California. The economy is better here and though we do have money shortfalls we are not bankrupt. Yes it\u2019s hot, but I\u2019d rather have heat than extreme cold. God bless Texas! kebozarth \nThank you for your heads-up. DownWithLibs \n@ Vegas Bob: \nTY! Yes, we haven\u2019t quite caught the horrible, sad mental illness known as \u201cLiberalism\u201d. Our strong-rooted Conservatism genes seem to be fending it off quite well.

Richard \nYou really need to leave the United States altogether and choose a country that is not about to be subjected to the horrors of a gut-wrenching depression. Asia is the obvious choice. They will suffer from the coming bust as well but thereafter they will pick themselves up, dust themselves off, bounce back and go from strength to strength. The Asians do not carry the crushing debts that will hobble the United States and Europe for generations to come. If you\u2019re looking for a country where they speak English, Malaysia\u2019s your answer. Ted \nNW NJ is overlooked.

Okie Dan \nIt is extremely difficult to predict what the fallout would be with an economic collapse. Will martial law take place? Will redistribution of wealth occur? Will military forces simply be used to round up unemployed masses especially in the city? Will the economic collapse have only marginally increased changes than the present situation? There can be no certainty in planning for the scenario. Obviously networks matter. I imagine Oklahoma to be for most people better than Illinois in such a scenario. But I have a sister and brother-in-law,and nephews in Illinois with a spacious house and they farm. I could move there, while in Oklahoma without a job, my network would likely not be nearly so solid nor certain. Lots to think about. metalurgy \nWelp, glad you are discouraging the Midwest. That is where I live. In MN. Happy to see the riff raff leave and move south to warmer climates. \nI know how to and have backpacked and camped in 80 below windchill in the middle of winter mutiple times in my life and was extremely warm and comfortable. \nEasy if you know how to live in this type of environment. \nThere is a ton of food to eat, even in the winter time.

Stop voting for immoral politicians who continue irresponsible wild spending, uncontrolled growth of debt, and irrational increases of taxes.

We\u2019re just different enough, however, that if the SHTF we would lock those borders down, become the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy, and feast on our oil, coal, forests, lakes, rivers, farms, wildlife, and football. Dang! Is Texas great or what? Rooster \nAre you kidding me\u2026.You can fivd problems in all areas of the U.S. Finding a place to go\u2026Now\u2026.it\u2019s way too late to think of relocating\u2026hunker down and prepare wherever you are; the finacial outlay for any move would better be used to have supplies. yes it is best to be out of a major populated area. Don\u2019t worry about the new madrid, worry about supplies like tolet paper\u2026.. Ben rhea \nThere is no place that you can consider best when economic collapse is already here. Doomsday scenarios rarely ever come true. I think this will iron out, but houses are not going to get really cheap any time soon if at all, and currency war still boiling, plus the riots in Middle East which has an indirect effect to all and natural calamities all over the world. I understand that our country is completely out of control. One would have to wonder if the truth even exists for people, much less corporations. The U.S.\u2019s unemployment stats are more manipulated, kneaded & massaged than the thighs on a world-class ballerina. \nHate applying to jobs? Let us do it for you. Human job search assistant \u2013 http://www.jobwaltz.com \nNorth Central and North West U.S. are good bets. They have tough cold seasons, but that will drive away those with not so good work ethics. \nPart of Americas problem is too many living off of those who are working. \nSouth California will be a lost cause as Mexico tries to take over. Texas on the other hand is not going to be very forgiving to those who have raped our system for years. I have worked with plenty of decent hard working Hispanics. But a good chunk of them don\u2019t care for America or the Gringos. \nNorth East will be bad when all the spent rod ponds at the nuke plants start going dry and you have radiation clouds down wind from them. \nThe coasts offer fish and water. It will be hard to over fish the oceans. You can also desalinate enough water to survive, especially if you have a hot day. Hurricanes can be prepared for, tsunamis, not so. So the East coast might be the better choice, unless you have a little elevation. There is historical evidence of major Tsunamis in Oregon AND SoCal in the last few hundred years.. \nLast bit of advice. If you have an acre or more, you absolutely should have a way to store 3 K gallons of water. No excuse if you have the rain. I hate seeing all that fresh water go down the ditch to the creek. \nSierra Dave coal \nWhat about being mobile with a camper of some sort. You would have to have access to a good supply of fuel? At any rate, too many variables to consider a place of safety. What looks good today could very well be the worst place to go after some event takes place. Being mobile, a better chance of being able to move swiftly as the situation dictates?? Hal \nGloom & Doom. Looks like we are in for some really bad times. Or not! USA has been through tough times before and bounced back every time. I don\u2019t expect this to be any different, but it may take a little longer. It would probably help if all you pessimists and doomsayers(cons or lib) would quit whining and speculating and get of your dead asses to do something positive for a change. OK, off the soapbox\u2026where to live\u2026.anywhere your heart desires No rules, but..buy property, preferably rural(at least one acre), if you can. If you can\u2019t afford or borrow, work, work , work till you have the means. Improve your credit and use it only for buying property(not for toys). Learn cycles\u2026do not buy during highs in the area. Do this and you will all at least survive any downturn and be better off than I am(retired, living in FL in an average house, on a small lot, close to the beach, but running out of money). Complaining? Nah. I have lived in many areas of the USA and UK and loved every minute. Endured tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and burglaries, all part of life. GET OVER IT!! Live your life!! Use good old American know how and innovation. Chris \nIf you agree with the premise that America is going to suddenly turn into Afghanistan over night then perhaps the rural/survivalist move is the way to go. If you believe that the descent will occur over 10-20 years you want to be urban. You want to be able to walk/bike to wherever you need. You need access to public transportation. You need access to jobs. Yes, there will still be jobs in the US and jobs equals money. We won\u2019t be bartering chickens for healthcare any time soon. You need public services such as fire and police as it is unlikely the suburbs will be supported by services or infrastructure improvements. Any further than the near suburbs will be completely out of the question for any support system whatsoever. Those areas will be sacrificed to the budgetary gods. Let\u2019s be honest, very very very few people are going to be capable of being self sufficient. \nObviously, most of the commenters think they they are the second coming of Grizzly Adams. Good for them. And good luck. You will need it. For the other 298 million of us, being close to the core and the support of friends and neighbors very close by is the best place to be for at least the next decade +. Larry Calhoun \nAt this time being very disabled I\u2019m living with family just East of Houston, TX. I WANT to move out of this present Hurricane endangered area & somewhere between Austin & Dallas. (Preferably in a high elevation area where a nice underground home can be built, and be protected from floods or tornados.) One great thing about living in \u2018the Republic of Texas\u2019s is that this State has reserved the right to secede from the USA ***if*** necessary. Also; establishing a residence that\u2019s not on the grid has its own unique appeal\u2026..doesn\u2019t it? Fed Up \n(Opps, I put this in the wrong article, belongs here) \nWe are planning on moving to Colorado. As \u201cJD\u201d said in another discussion, \u201cthe Rockies are the last best place.\u201d \nColorado already has lots of preppers, organized in various areas and they meetup as a group a few times a year. CO has low taxes, hardly any gun laws, and a history of independent thinking and self-reliance. If you live at lower elevations the weather is perfect four seasons, with LOTS of sunshine, no natural disasters (except forest fires), and NO BUGS. Water can be an issue, but there are lots of creeks, rivers, and good wells if you look for them. \nThere\u2019s plenty of wildlife, fishing, and firewood. Except for the ski and resort areas, housing and land prices are very affordable in the remoter areas. Slade \nIn the UNlikely event of a complete breakdown of the economy and law and order, our best bet is the two Fs: Family and Firearms. Gary2 \nHT Liu-good point we need to not let the economic collapse happen in the first place. \nPeople need to stop voting for any republican period. They need to look at what any dem does and not what they say. I am so sick of dems talking a good progressive game and then being way too conservative like Obama. \nYes, Obama is better than any republican but I am really getting sick of choosing the lesser of 2 evils. \nI want Bernie Sanders for President. redgypsy \nLook West of Port Angeles WA Can feed a large family on 5 acres with food to spare. Quite and remote and plenty of resourses. Dee \nYou never mentioned Colorado? We have fresh mountain streams,plenty of game and not too many overcrowded areas. Plus, a large number of people who know how to survive off of the land and who are already starting to band together and plan\u2026 \nOur Gourmet Survival Food Business Opportunity \nThe best place to live is in Santa Cruz California. We\u2019re above any Tsunami levels. Earthquakes are fun here and have never killed anyone. The University of California provides much cultural things to do. The weather is PERFECT year-round and the population low. The Beaches are beautiful, AND you can get everything you need, including our Survival Food. No big cities even close. Xploregon \nIn 2-3 months I\u2019ll have two (2) two (2) acre remote wooded lots available for sale in south/central Oregon (Coos County)for sale (price not yet determined) on a very large fresh water lake about three (3) miles inland from the beach. Currently lake/water access only but may have seasonal road which can be developed to year round if desired. 30+ miles of nothing but deep Pacific NW forest (mostly state forest land)to the East and simular S, N & West. Sportsmans paradise in the \u201cbananna belt\u201d of Oregon. Septic and water well approvable. Badguy \nYes, the Midwest is a rust belt\u2026 but that may be an advantage! We\u2019re ALREADY poor.. so any hard economic times will only be \u201cmore of the same\u201d. Also, there\u2019s plenty of fresh water, woods and ground that can be cultivated easily. Also, it\u2019s hard to hold riots when the temperature is 20 degress F or below (5 months a year). Also, if an when, the government decides that bringing back manufacturing is a must if a military confrontation with China becomes eminent or to avoid a complete social and political collapse, we still have trained workers the can restart the process. Liz Michael \nIn the event of a collapse, you probably want to pick a place or a region which could survive on its own as an independent republic. To me, this means Texas, and any state relatively close to Texas. I am in Arizona, close enough to Texas. In a collapse, illegal immigration may no longer be a problem: no jobs means no immigrants. Phenius Barnham \nKetchum, Idaho. The rest of Idaho is not all that you\u2019d want. The Ski Folk come and spread smiles. Scott and Smith are headquartered here. The Sawtooth Mountains are some of the prettiest in the world and the populace are friendly and educated. Mountains are always the last to attract military. Yellowstone is not going to go off so relax. The homes are all well built and there ain\u2019t no junk. Crime is non-existant because most people have their own money and the poor always have jobs. MICHAELD \nNorthern and North Central Idaho has the advantages of rural life but access to several larger communities in Oregon and Washington, just across the Idaho border in the Panhandle. The Lewiston/Clarkston area at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers has a great climate (much warmer than the surrounding higher elevations) and access to any outdoor recreation you can think of. Coeur d\u2019Alene and Post Falls are very close to Spokane. All have great medical facilities. \nJobs are tough to come by, but self employment is a great option for anyone handy with tools. Lots of retired folk live here and they generally have resources to hire things done for them. Acreages are still cheap, too. BMOC \nI live on South Beach. I can eat pole dancers and foreign tourists. And their children. My tinfoil hat will keep me from sunburn. I live near a pharmacy to supply me my Prozac. In case of riots I can club people on their heads with a Cuban sandwich to defend myself. If things get too bad here I can grab onto an old tire and float myself over to the Bahamas. Life will be OK. \nIf you can\u2019t leave your city, then the Urban Survival Guide shows you how to survive during a crisis, and protect yourself and your family. \nDavid",

And Sirota is a busy lad\u2013 \n\u201cHow Donald Trump Used Fine Print To Make It Harder To Sue Wall Street For Fraud\u201d [David Sirota, International Business Times ]. In Links this morning, but amplifying: \nAccording to hundreds of pages of court documents reviewed by International Business Times, Trump notched a victory for himself and the financial industry by convincing judges that his own fine print warnings meant he had not deceived investors when he lured them to bet \u2014 and ultimately lose \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars on one of his riskiest development projects. The real estate mogul known for his litigiousness helped Corporate America secure a ruling making it harder for investors to file lawsuits. Unlike his other past business moves that appeared to affect only Trump\u2019s business partners, vendors and customers, this Trump case helped set a court precedent that was soon codified into law. \nTrump, in essence, argued \u201cit\u2019s my nature\u201d: \nTrump did not explicitly challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that his prospectus contained misleading or inaccurate information. Instead, his lawyer argued that \u201cthe cautionary language in this prospectus was so complete, so repetitive, so obvious and so well designed\u201d that it could not have misled investors. The court concurred. \n\u201cLet\u2019s set aside Hillary Clinton as an individual and consider her as the perfection of a corrupt political system. As I noted yesterday, Politics As Usual Is Dead, and Hillary Clinton is the ultimate product of the political system that is disintegrating before our eyes\u201d [ Of Two Minds ]. \u201cAll the Clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else. Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in \u2018contributions\u2019 and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds.\u201d Which is why Clinton\u2019s public promises on policy are meaningless; we don\u2019t know who her silent partners are. And that ties rather neatly into her incrementalism, which she frames as \u201cI don\u2019t want to promise what I can\u2019t deliver\u201d (but to whom were the promises really made?) More: \u201cCobble together a multi-million dollar private foundation, millions of dollars in speaking fees from big-money contributors, conflicts of interest, the secrecy of private email servers, pay-to-play schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the Department of Justice, and the inevitable result is a politics as usual money-harvesting machine that lays waste to the nation, supporters and critics alike.\u201d \nThe Voters \n\u201cThe Daily 202: College-educated white women are Hillary Clinton\u2019s firewall\u201d [ WaPo ]. \u201cIf the Republican nominee was anywhere close to Romney\u2019s 52 percent support level among this traditionally Republican-leaning constituency, he would likely win the election.\u201d From what I read on the Twitter \u2014 admittedly an idiosyncratic sample \u2014 Clinton\u2019s previous firewall feels like she used and abandoned them.

A friendly map with seven Republican-held seats in states President Obama won has opened the door, and now Republicans are hoping Donald Trump doesn\u2019t drag them down in the many tough states they have to defend\u201d [ WaPo ].

Nice and easy,\u2019 Trump said.\u201d So Conway is doing her job. \n\u201cPut another way, as Clinton has focused her time and money primarily on swing and Republican-leaning states, the question looming over her campaign is whether she has left herself open to a flanking maneuver from Trump in any of the seemingly safe Democratic states that he is now targeting\u2014key among them Colorado, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u201d [Ron Brownstein, The Atlantic ]. \u201cClinton and her allies are responding with a new wave of advertising and more surrogate appearances in those blue-leaning states, and most dramatically, a visit by Clinton herself to Detroit on Friday. But overall they see Trump\u2019s late push into these Democratic-leaning places as a sign of weakness, not strength\u2014an admission that at this late date he needs new options for reaching an Electoral College majority because he cannot feel secure of capturing enough of the states both sides consider true battlegrounds.\u201d \n\u201cA tightening race nationally has also translated into tightening at the state level. States that were trending Trump\u2019s way in September started to slip away from him in early October.

Republicans \u201ccoming home.\u201d \n\u201cTwo things to look for in the exits: First, how is Mr. Trump doing among white voters? His strategy requires grabbing a higher percentage of whites than Mitt Romney\u2019s 59% and boosting their share of the turnout above 2012\u2019s 72%.

Will he match Mr. Romney\u2019s 51% among all college grads?\u201d [Karl Rove, Wall Street Journal , \u201cWhat to Watch for on Election Night\u201d]. \u201cSecond, how is Mrs. Clinton doing among minorities and millennials? Her strategy calls for replicating President Obama\u2019s 2012 coalition. That year African-Americans were 13% of turnout, and 93% went for Mr. Obama; Hispanics were 10% of turnout, and 71% voted for him; and millennials were 19% of turnout, 60% of whom supported the president.\u201d \n\u201cOnly voters in six states: Connecticut, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are allowed to void their early or absentee ballots and cast a new vote\u201d [ Daily Dot ]. \nDemocrat Email Hairball \n\u201cHere\u2019s the updated list of all Podesta docs published by @WikiLeaks that have been proven, or claimed, to be fake\u201d [ Glenn Greenwald ]. \nStats Watch \nBig stats day today!

Greater efficiency between output and hours worked holds down labor costs which rose only 0.3 percent which is much better than expectations.\u201d And: \u201cThe driving force for third-quarter productivity was a surge in output coupled by the lower labor cost gain\u201d [ 247 Wall Street ]. But: \u201cAlthough many times the data is significantly revised between releases \u2013 it did not happen in this release.

Moreover, Mansoor alleged the yard had just one ambulance, which was being actually used for transporting the officials\u2019 children to and from school. Mansoor said a total of 250 workers were working on the tanker when the explosion occurred. \n\u201cWe demand that a murder case be registered right away against the Ship Breakers\u2019 Association,\u201d he said, calling for Rs3m compensation for each of the dead victims\u2019 families. \nOf course, given the givens, the explosion and the deaths follow from over-capacity as the night the day. And it\u2019s not as if the conditions at Gadani weren\u2019t common knowledge among elites. I remember reading this article in The Atlantic in 2014, and here\u2019s an image from it: \nSo, in the beached tanker, ka-boom! Whenever you hear the word \u201caccident,\u201d think to yourself: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018accident\u2019?\u201d Oh, and there\u2019s this little detail: \nThe floating oil production tanker, ACES (IMO # 8021830), was sold to the Gadani shipbreaker by Jakarta-based PT Sinar Mentari Prima and was used in the Jabung Batanghari terminal owned by the Indonesian government company BPMIGAS and operated by PetroChina. The change of flag and name of the ship happened just weeks before it reached the beach of Gadani, which strongly point towards the use of a cash buyer for the sale of the end-of-life vessel. \nHmm.

Around 60% of global supply of cobalt comes from the DRC. Cobalt doesn\u2019t currently fall under the SEC\u2019s Dodd-Frank section 1502 covering conflict minerals and there is no specific compliance regulations attached to the sourcing of the mineral. But the lack of scrutiny by regulators seems likely to change in the near future as demand for cobalt and understanding of its sourcing increases.\u201d \nETFs: \u201cThis Year\u2019s Most Innovative New ETFs\u201d [ETFs.com]. \u201cInnovative\u201d?

In fact fewer than 1000 people googled \u2018What is the EU?\u2019 and there was no evidence that that a single person who had googled the question had voted Leave. Yet supporters of the EU continued to propagate this as evidence of the ignorance of Leave voters.

The slightest bit of self-discipline on Trump\u2019s part, and Clinton is suddenly in the race of her life.

The crisis hasn\u2019t hit yet, but those members of the political class who think that the people who used to be rock-solid American patriots will turn out en masse to keep today\u2019s apparatchiks secure in their comfortable lifestyles have, as the saying goes, another think coming. Nor is it irrelevant that most of the enlisted personnel in the armed forces, who are the US government\u2019s ultimate bulwark against popular unrest, come from the very classes that have lost faith most drastically in the American system. The one significant difference between the Soviet case and the American one at this stage of the game is that Soviet citizens had no choice but to accept the leaders the Communist Party of the USSR foisted off on them, from Brezhnev to Andropov to Chernenko to Gorbachev, until the system collapsed of its own weight\u2026 \nIf George W. Bush was our Leonid Brezhnev, as I\u2019d suggest, and Barack Obama is our Yuri Andropov, Hillary Clinton is running for the position of Konstantin Chernenko; her running mate Tim Kaine, in turn, is waiting in the wings as a suitably idealistic and clueless Mikhail Gorbachev, under whom the whole shebang can promptly go to bits. While I don\u2019t seriously expect the trajectory of the United States to parallel that of the Soviet Union anything like as precisely as this satiric metaphor would suggest, the basic pattern of cascading dysfunction ending in political collapse is quite a common thing in history, and a galaxy of parallels suggests that the same thing could very easily happen here within the next decade or so. The serene conviction among the political class and their affluent hangers-on that nothing of the sort could possibly take place is just another factor making it more likely. \n\u201cWhy Trump Is Different\u2014and Must Be Repelled\u201d [Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker ]. \nFor the past months, and into this final week, as for much of the past year, many New Yorkers have been in a position that recalls parents with a colicky baby: you put the baby down at last, it seems safely asleep, grateful and unbelievably exhausted you return to bed\u2014only to hear the small tell-tale cough or sob that guarantees another crying jag is on the way. The parents in this case, to fill in the metaphorical blanks, are liberal-minded folk; the baby\u2019s cries are any indicators that Donald Trump may not be out of the race for President\u2014as he seemed to be even as recently as last week\u2014and may actually have a real chance at being elected. Disbelief crowds exhaustion: this can\u2019t be happening. If the colicky baby is a metaphor too sweet for so infantile a figure as the orange menace, then let us think instead, perhaps, of the killer in a teen horror movie of the vintage kind: every time Freddy seemed dispatched and buried, there he was leaping up again, as the teens caught their breath and returned, too soon, to their teendom. \nOf course, Gopnik \u2014 a bad-faith liberal who should really stick to writing gauzy atmospheric pieces about Paris \u2014 is both passive-aggressive and infuriatingly smug. To \u201cfill in the metaphorical blanks,\u201d both the \u201ccolicky baby\u201d and the teen horror movie villain are infantilized and displaced versions of The Other: The Trump voter that Eurostar-rider Gopnik hates and fears, because he\u2019s afraid their going to kill him and take his stuff. \nDemocrat Email Hairball \n\u201cDow surges 300 points as FBI clears Clinton on eve of election\u201d [ USA Today ].

It means organizing state policies by making them appear as if they are the consequences of depoliticized financial markets.

Actual open markets for goods and services tend to disappear in neoliberal societies. Financial markets flourish, real markets morph into mass distribution middlemen like Walmart or Amazon. \nNeoliberalism is not faith in free markets. Neoliberalism is not free market capitalism.

                              "text": "by Bryan William Myers | Oct 29, 2016 \nBack on Sept. 3, 2016, Labor Day weekend in America, protesters in North Dakota representing the Standing Rock Sioux were attacked with dogs and pepper spray while attempting to halt construction on an approximately $4 billion crude oil pipeline that would extend nearly 1,200 miles from the northern interior of the U.S. to south-central Illinois. One of the oil companies \u201cresponsible\u201d for the pipeline is Dakota Access, LLC \u2014 a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC . \nSome quick facts about the pipeline, from an Energy Transfer Partners website: \nThe pipeline will \u201c\u2026transport crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks play in North Dakota to a terminus in Illinois with additional potential points of destination along the pipeline route.\u201d \n\u201cThe pipeline will translate into millions in state and local revenues during the construction phase and an estimated $156 million in sales and income taxes.\u201d \n\u201cThe Dakota Access Pipeline Project is a $3.7 billion investment into the United States directly impacting the local and national labor force by creating 8,000\u201312,000 construction jobs and up to 40 permanent operating jobs.\u201d \n\u201cThe pipeline is anticipated to be fully functional by 2016.\u201d \nUltimately, this is conjecture. \nWHO ARE THE SIOUX? \nAbout the Sioux: \n\u201cThe Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is situated in North and South Dakota. The people of Standing Rock, often called Sioux, are members of the Dakota and Lakota nations. \u2018Dakota\u2019 and \u2018Lakota\u2019 mean \u2018friends\u2019 or \u2018allies\u2019. The people of both these nations are often called \u2018Sioux\u2019, a term that dates back to the seventeenth century when the people were living in the Great Lakes area. The Ojibwa called the Lakota and Dakota \u2018Nadouwesou\u2019 meaning \u2018adders\u2019. This term, shortened and corrupted by French traders, resulted in retention of the last syllable as \u2018Sioux.\u2019 There are various Sioux divisions and each has important cultural, linguistic, territorial, and political distinctions.\u201d \nWhere do they live? \n\u201cThe Great Sioux Reservation comprised all of present-day South Dakota west of the Missouri River, including the sacred Black Hills and the life-giving Missouri River. Under article 11 of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty, the Great Sioux Nation retained off-reservation hunting rights to a much larger area, south to the Republican and Platte Rivers, and east to the Big Horn Mountains. Under article 12, no cession of land would be valid unless approved by three-fourths of the adult males. Nevertheless, the Congress unilaterally passed the Act of February 28, 1877, removing the Sacred Black Hills from the Great Sioux Reservation. The United States never obtained the consent of three-fourths of the Sioux, as required in article 12 of the 1868 Treaty. The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that \u2018A more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealings will never, in all probability, be found in our history.'\u201d \nAs the years wore on, and more of their land was claimed by the invader \u2014 the U.S. government \u2014 the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe eventually formed their own constitution in 1959 to be overseen by a Tribal Council. \n\u201cThe Tribal Council consists of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, a Secretary, and fourteen additional Councilmen which are elected by the tribal members.\u201d \nAnd now, once again, they are up against the sprawling U.S. empire, which will stop at nothing when natural resources are coveted for the invader\u2019s profit machine. This time, it\u2019s the unelected bureaucracy of oil companies and monopolistic energy partnerships in America paired with the funding from nearly 20 U.S., U.K., and other international banking institutions who are all involved in this endless destruction of Native lands. \nCombined with a militarized police state \u2014 hundreds of arrests, assaults with batons and rubber bullets, armored vehicles with sound cannons, Humvees, helicopters flying overhead, and troops from the National Guard \u2014 the recent events in North Dakota resemble that of a war zone, more than a peaceful protest. \nTRANSPORTING OIL OUT OF NORTH DAKOTA \nCrude oil transported out of North Dakota has traditionally been shipped on rail cars to get to the east coast. Over the years, the competitive push to match domestic demand with imported crude oil pressurized the internal transport system, increasing rail-car shipping incidents. \nFrom Pennsylvania StateImpact , \u201ca reporting project of NPR member stations\u201d: \n\u201cRefineries on the East Coast used to rely on crude oil from Nigeria and the Gulf of Mexico shipped on large tankers. Today, trains carrying crude oil from North Dakota\u2019s Bakken Shale travel on rail lines through Pennsylvania. The rail shipments are part of a larger nationwide boom in rail traffic resulting from the oil and gas boom and have helped keep refineries in the Philadelphia region stay in business . \nHowever, increased traffic on the rails has resulted in a surge in accidents, including an explosive derailment in Lac-Megantic, Quebec that left 47 people dead in July 2013. The crude-by-rail phenomenon has come under intense scrutiny from federal agencies, as well as state and local governments across the country who worry that a derailment in more populous cities like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia could result in catastrophe.\u201d \nThis, in tandem with crashing oil prices . \nPaired with a previous announcement in May 2015 from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), for new rules to \u201cstrengthen the safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail\u201d. \nAnd you\u2019ve got a perfect environment for vulture capitalist intervention. \nTHE BANKS SWOOP IN \nBack in September, Democracy Now! did an exclusive report entitled \u201cWho\u2019s Investing in the Dakota Access Pipeline? Meet the Banks Financing Attacks on Protesters\u201d. \n\u201cWe continue our conversation with Hugh MacMillan (senior researcher at Food & Water Watch) on his new investigation revealing the financial institutions backing the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline project. \nThe investigation, published by research outlet LittleSis, names more than two dozen major banks and financial institutions helping to finance the Dakota Access pipeline. It details how Bank of America, HSBC , UBS , Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and other financial institutions have, combined, extended a $3.75 billion credit line to Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access.\u201d \nIn the interview, MacMillan begins: \n\u201cDakota Access, LLC is a joint venture of Phillips 66, and a joint venture of two members of the Energy Transfer family, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. Enbridge (Energy Partners) and Marathon (Petroleum Corporation) oil have bought into this joint venture. Together, they now have about a 37% stake in the pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline.\u201d \nWhen Amy Goodman asked how the banks were involved, MacMillan responded: \n\u201cThey\u2019re banking on this company, and banking on being able to drill and frack for the oil to [be sent] through the pipeline over the coming decades. So they\u2019re providing the capital for the construction of this pipeline.\u201d \nMacMillan then asserts that the 17 banks in their funding of the Dakota Access pipeline through Energy Transfer Partners are also coupled together with an existing pipeline that will be converted to extend from the southern end of the Dakota Access pipeline all the way down to the Gulf Coast. \n\u201cWhere there are refineries and also export infrastructure.\u201d \nHere is a picture of that proposal from the Sunoco Logistics website: \nMacMillan stated the ultimate goal of the pipeline projects will be to have one pipeline that would run from \u201cnear the Canadian border on down to the Gulf Coast of Texas, over 1,800 miles.\u201d \nAs to which banks, specifically, are directly involved in the Dakota Access pipeline: \n\u201cCitibank is the bank that\u2019s been running the books on the project. And that\u2019s the bank that \u2018beat the bushes\u2019 and got other banks to join in. So we have Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mizuho Bank, TD Securities, ABN AMRO, DNB First bank (based in Philadelphia), ICBC London, SMBC Nikko Securities, and Societe Generale.\u201d \nGoodman then asked MacMillan about the drop in demand for oil, in the past year, with regard to a personal conversation she had with an oil trucker. \n\u201cIf you ask Morgan Stanley, they said a year ago that the oil producers are getting into \u2018prison shape\u2019\u2014 without irony. So these are long term investments from the banks. They fully expect the United States to maximize its production of oil and gas through widespread fracking.\u201d \nMacMillan summarized what he believed was most crucial for people to understand about the Dakota Access Pipeline: \n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s important to see the forces behind this particular pipeline as the same forces behind numerous other pipelines across the country, both to support fracking for tight oil as well as fracking for shale gas, all toward maximizing production of oil and gas. When the science is clear that we need to maximize what we keep in the ground. Our current policy has not made that switch. And if you look at the Department of Energy\u2019s Quadrennial Technology Review, published a year ago, you\u2019ll see under clean energy technologies, permeability manipulation is included along with improved understanding of well integrity and improved understanding of injections and how they\u2019re causing earthquakes, such as [what] occurred over the weekend in Oklahoma. The Quadrennial Technology Review speaks of a future mastery of the subsurface towards maximizing production.\u201d \nOTHER HANDS IN THE POT \nMost recently, it has come out that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million invested in Energy Transfer Partners , the parent company of the Dakota Access pipeline, in addition to having $500,000 \u2013 $1 million invested in Phillips 66 \u2014 a company which will also hold a 25% stake in the pipeline. Kelcy Warren, co-founder and chief executive of Energy Transfer Partners, donated more than $100,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign, and he gave nearly $67,000 to the Republican National Committee since Trump became the party\u2019s controversial candidate for president in the 2016 election. \nAccording to the Guardian, Warren gave a $3,000 personal donation to Trump\u2019s election campaign back in June. That amount exceeded $2,700 \u2014 the legal limit for individual contributions. Previously, Warren donated $550,000 to current Texas governor Greg Abbott\u2019s 2014 campaign. After Abbott won the election, he then appointed Warren and his wife to state boards, the Guardian reported. \n\u201cWarren has worked in the energy industry for the past 25 years and has a net worth of $3.8bn, according to Forbes . The Texas-based businessman has said concerns over the Dakota Access pipeline are \u2018unfounded\u2019 and insisted there are no Native American artifacts at risk from its construction. He vowed that Energy Transfer Partners will press ahead with the project .\u201d \nRECENT RESPONSES FROM POLITICIANS ON DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE \nOn Thursday, Oct. 27, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign released a statement with regard to the Dakota Access pipeline project and the ongoing protests where hundreds have been arrested in recent weeks. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators\u2019 rights to protest peacefully, and workers\u2019 rights to do their jobs safely\u2026\u201d \nBernie Sanders made a much less benign statement on the issue: \n\u201cThe major global crisis facing our planet today is climate change. The vast majority of scientists tell us that climate change is real, it is caused by humans and it is already causing devastating problems. They say that if we do not aggressively transition our energy system away from fossil fuels toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy, the planet we leave our children will be a much less habitable place. \nLike the Keystone XL pipeline, which I opposed since day one, the Dakota Access fracked oil pipeline, will transport some of the dirtiest fuel on the planet. Regardless of the court\u2019s decision, the Dakota Access pipeline must be stopped. As a nation, our job is to break our addiction to fossil fuels, not increase our dependence on oil. I join with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the many tribal nations fighting this dangerous pipeline.\u201d \nHere is Sanders\u2019 letter to U.S. President Barack Obama on this issue, from Oct. 28. \nA previous letter, dated Oct. 13, was also sent to the president, regarding the halting of construction on the Dakota Access pipeline. That letter was also signed by Sanders, in addition to four other U.S. Senators. \nCollectively, banks from nearly a dozen countries are involved in the funding of the Dakota Access pipeline. \nAnd, last weekend, on Friday, Oct. 21, an oil pipeline was breached , spilling gasoline in close proximity to the Susquehanna River, in an area of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania \u2014 about 100 miles north of the state capital, Harrisburg. The spill was estimated at 1,300 barrels, or 55,000 gallons of gasoline. \nThe owner of that pipeline is Sunoco Logistics, which has had over 200 leaks of crude since 2010, much more than any of its competitors. \nIt\u2019s the same oil company that will be operating the Dakota Access pipeline.

Aired 8-10p ET Aired March 15, 2020 - 20:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.  [20:00:00]  TAPPER: Good evening from Washington, D.C. And welcome to this unique event, the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate with the two leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.  Candidates, welcome, it's good to have you. I'm Jake Tapper, along with CNN's Dana Bash and Univision's Ilia Calderon.  BASH: We come together tonight at an extraordinary time in our country when people are worried about far more than just presidential politics. We're in a national emergency because of the devastating global pandemic of coronavirus. It has killed nearly 6,000 people around the world, and 65 dead and more than 3,300 known cases here in the United States. As a result, tonight's debate will focus heavily on the crisis.  CALDERON: The setting of this debate is also different. To reduce unnecessary risk of transmission of the virus, CNN, Univision, the Democratic National Committee, and the campaigns moved this debate from Phoenix, Arizona, to here at CNN studios in Washington, without any audience.  TAPPER: And all of this comes, of course, as four more states -- Florida, Arizona, Ohio, and Illinois -- prepare to vote on Tuesday, with Vice President Biden currently leading Senator Sanders in the race for delegates.  Here's what we're going to do tonight. Each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. As much as we can, we hope this will be a conversation between the two of you.  So let's begin with the most important issue right now: the coronavirus and what you would do as president in the face of it. Vice President Biden, let me start with you. We're in a reality right now that might have seemed unimaginable a week ago. Schools have been cancelled for more than 25 million students. Grocery store shelves have been cleared out. March Madness, NBA games, Disney parks, Broadway, small businesses all shut down, and just today, the CDC issued a new recommendation that for the next eight weeks events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the U.S. be cancelled or postponed.  What do you say to the American people who are confronting this new reality?  BIDEN: Well, first of all, my heart goes out to those who have already lost someone or those who are suffering from the virus. And this is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying to everybody move together.  And, you know, I laid out in detail what I would do were I president today. You can go to joebiden.com. I laid it out in significant detail.  But there are three pieces to this. First of all, we have to take care of those who, in fact, are exposed or likely to be exposed to the virus. And that means we have to do testing, we have to get the testing kits up and ready. I would have the World Health Organization, I'd take advantage of the test kits they have available to us, even though the president says a million or more are coming. Let's just get all the tests we can, done, as quickly as we can.  Secondly, I would make sure that every state in the union had at least 10 places where they had drive-thru testing arrangements. I would also at this point deal with the need to begin to plan for the need for additional hospital beds. We have that capacity in the Department of Defense, as well as with the FEMA. And they can set up 100-bed, 500-bed hospitals and tents quickly. We have to lay all that out.  But we have to deal with the economic fallout quickly. And that means making sure that people who, in fact, lose their job, don't get a paycheck, can't pay their mortgage, are able to pay it and pay them now. And do it now. Small businesses, be able to borrow interest- free loans.  I see my time is up here. Are you going to hold us tightly, I assume, but that's what I would do. Go to Joebiden.com. It lays out precisely what I would do were I were president today.  TAPPER: Senator Sanders, this morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci acknowledged that it's possible that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans, could die from coronavirus in a worst-case scenario. If you were president right now, what's the most important thing you would do tonight to try to save American lives?  SANDERS: Well, firstly, we have to do -- whether or not I'm president, is to shut this president up right now, because he is undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people. It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with unfactual information, which is confusing the general public.  Second of all, what we need to do -- and I'm glad that he has called a state of national emergency -- what we have got to do is move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country finally understands that when they get sick with the coronavirus, that they will -- that all payments will be made, that they don't have to worry about coming up with money for testing, they don't have to worry about coming up with money for treatment.  [20:05:00] This is an unprecedented moment in American history. Now, I obviously believe in Medicare for all. I will fight for that as president.  But right now, in this emergency, I want every person in this country to understand that when you get sick, you go to the doctor. When you get sick, if you have the virus, that will be paid for. Do not worry about the cost right now, because we're in the middle of a national emergency.  Second of all, we have to make sure that our hospitals have the ventilators that they need, have the IC units that they need. Right now, we have a lack of medical personnel. And I worry very much that if there is a peak, whether we have the capability of dealing with hundreds of thousands of people who may be in hospitals.  So we need unprecedented action right now to deal with the unprecedented crisis. And bottom line, from an economic point of view, what we have got to say to the American people, if you lose your job, you will be made whole. You're not going to lose income. If Trump can put -- or the Fed can president $1.5 trillion into the banking system, we can protect the wages of every worker in America.  TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.  Vice President Biden, President Trump says he does not take any responsibility for the problems with coronavirus testing, in part because, he says, he inherited so many rules, regulations, and red tape. Did bureaucratic red tape hamper this response in any way?  BIDEN: No, look, the World Health Organization offered -- offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own. I think he said something like we have the best scientists in America, or something to that effect.  The idea that we are not prepared for this and not -- and the other thing I want to point out. And I agree with Bernie. We're in a situation where we have to now be providing for the hospitals that are going to be needed, needed now. The present system cannot handle the surge that is likely to come.  So we should already be sitting down and planning where we're going to put these temporary hospitals. And we can do that. We did that -- we've been through this before with the coronavirus. We've been through this -- I mean, excuse me, we've been through this before with dealing with the viruses that -- the H1N1 -- as well as what happened in Africa. We provided these hospitals dealing with these great pandemics, and we were able to do it quickly. And people would have a place to go. But we also have to provide the equipment to protect the first responders. And that's not being done, either.  TAPPER: Senator Sanders, on that note -- and both of you have addressed this -- but, obviously, another major health concern right now for officials is the potential surge in patients all at once, overburdening hospitals, the health care system. You've mentioned ICU beds, both of you, and ventilators.  We're already in the middle of flu season, so already a lot of those beds and ventilators are already being used. If you were president right now, what would you do to make sure every sick American is able to get treatment so the U.S. does not suffer the same fate as Italy, where doctors have to decide right now who gets life-saving treatment and who does not?  SANDERS: Jake, let's be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current health care system. Now, we're spending twice as much per person on health care as the people of any other country. How in God's name does it happen that we end up with 87 million people who are uninsured or underinsured and there are people who are watching this program tonight who are saying, \"I'm not feeling well. Should I go to the doctor? But I can't afford to go to the doctor. What happens if I am sick? It's going to cost thousands of for treatment. Who's going to feed my kids?\"  We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people. We're spending so much money and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic. How come we don't have enough doctors? How come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down? How come people can't afford to get the prescription drugs they need because we have a bunch of crooks who are running the pharmaceutical industry, ripping us off every single day?  And I'll tell you something right now. In the midst of this epidemic, you got people in the pharmaceutical industry who are saying, oh, wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune.  So the word has got to go out, and I certainly would do this as president: You don't worry. People of America, do not worry about the cost of prescription drugs. Do not worry about the cost of the health care that you're going to get, because we are a nation -- a civilized democratic society. Everybody, rich and poor, middle class, will get the care they need. The drug companies will not rip us off.  BASH: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, some medical experts are saying the only true way to control this virus is through a national quarantine, requiring every American, other than essential personnel, to stay home. Would you take that unprecedented step of a national lockdown?  BIDEN: What I would do is what we did in our administration.  [20:10:00]  I would call a meeting in the Situation Room of all the experts in America dealing with this crisis. I would sit them down and I would do exactly what we did then. What is it that we need? Listen to the experts. What do we need?  And with all due respect for Medicare for all, you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn't work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare for all. That would not solve the problem at all. We can take care of that right now by making sure that no one has to  pay for treatment, period, because of the crisis. No one has to pay for whatever drugs are needed, period, because of the crisis. No one has to pay for hospitalization because of the crisis, period. That is a national emergency, and that's how it's handled. It is not working in Italy right now, and they have a single-payer system.  SANDERS: Well...  BIDEN: Now, with regard to what else I would do, the fact is that we're in a position where I would bring together the leading experts in the world. Instead of doing this -- in the United States -- instead of doing this piecemeal, sit down and do what we did before with the Ebola crisis, what is needed and have one voice, one voice, like we did every day we met in that crisis in the Situation Room, laying out -- so we lay out overall, for all nation, what the best proposal is and how to move forward.  In the absence of that, governors are making some sound decisions. They're doing the best they can by going out and getting the health care experts is their communities and their states to move. But it should be directed from the White House, from the Situation Room, laying out in detail like we did in the Ebola crisis. And we beat it.  BASH: Thank you. Thank you. Senator Sanders, your response?  SANDERS: Well, first of all, the dysfunctionality of the current health care system is obviously apparent. As I said earlier, there are people who hesitate going to the doctor. You're going to have a maze of regulations -- well, if this is my income, if that's my income, can I get it, can I not get it? Clearly, we are not prepared. And Trump only exacerbates the crisis.  When we spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation, one might expect that we would have enough doctors all over this country. One might expect that we would have affordable prescription drugs. One might expect that we are preparing effectively for a pandemic that we were ready with the ventilators, with the ICUs, with the test kits that we need. We are not.  And bottom line here is, in terms of Medicare for all, despite what the vice president is saying, what the experts tell us is that one of the reasons that we are unprepared and have been unprepared is we don't have a system. We've got thousands of private insurance plans. That is not a system that is prepared to provide health care to all people.  In a good year, without the epidemic, we're losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time. It's clearly this crisis is only making a bad situation worse.  BIDEN: That has nothing to do when you're in a national crisis. The national crisis says, we're responding. It's all free. You don't have to pay for a thing. That has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy. This is a crisis. We're at war with the virus. We're at war with the virus. It has nothing to do with co-pays or anything. We just pass a law saying that you do not have to pay for any of this, period.  SANDERS: That's not true.  BIDEN: Period.  SANDERS: As a matter of fact, that's not true. That law has enormous loopholes. I understand that Nancy Pelosi did her best, Republicans prevented it.  BIDEN: No, I'm...  SANDERS: What -- what you're talking about, Joe, here is enormous loopholes within that, that, in fact, it is not necessarily covering treatment for all people in America, and that people are going to be stuck with the bill unless we change that. And we're going to offer legislation to, in fact, change that.  BIDEN: If I may, I offered legislation. I laid out on my plan that it would cover exactly what is not covered by the House. I laid out in the plan that I laid out for how we would deal with this crisis. Nobody -- nobody will pay for anything having to do with the crisis.  This is a national emergency. There isn't a question of whether or not this is something that could be covered by insurance or anything else. We, out of the Treasury, are going to pay for this. It's a national emergency.  SANDERS: But you see...  BIDEN: That's what my plan calls for.  SANDERS: But the weakness of this -- let's just do a hypothetical. Family member's diagnosed with the virus. Terrible tragedy, massive anxiety. The wife has the virus, the husband is a wreck, wants to go to a psychologist, wants to get counseling, doesn't have the money to do that.  Maybe their kid breaks a leg. They don't have the money to go to health care. So you're saying right now, in the middle of a crisis, but, you know what, last year at least 30,000 people died in America because they didn't get health care when they should, because we don't have universal coverage.  I think that's a crisis. One out of five people in America cannot afford the prescription drugs they need. They suffer. Some die. I consider that a crisis.  [20:15:00]  Bottom line is, we need a simple system, which exists in Canada, exists in countries all over the world, and that is, if you are an American, you get the health care you need, end of discussion. We can save huge sums of money doing that. The trick is, do we have the guts to take on the health care industry, some of which is funding the vice president's campaign? Do we have the courage to take on the executives at the prescription drug industry, some of which -- some of whom are funding his campaign?  BASH: Thank you, Senator.  Vice President Biden?  BIDEN: Look, I -- this is a national crisis. I don't want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics here. I've laid out a plan, building on Obamacare, providing a public option of Medicare, it would cover everyone the same way. This idea that this is his only answer is a mistake in notion.  But regardless of whether my plan was in place or his, this is a crisis. This is like we are being attacked from abroad. This is something that is of great consequence. This is like a war. And in a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people.  And what you do is you -- and I have proposed it, laid it out in detail -- everything that you need in terms of dealing with this crisis would be free. It is paid for by the taxpayers generally. Generally. It has nothing to do with Bernie's Medicare for all.  And by the way...  BASH: Vice President Biden, thank you.  SANDERS: Let me just...  BASH: If I may, the vice president just mentioned war. Would you deploy the U.S. military in an effort to contain the virus? And if so, how?  SANDERS: Well, I think we use all of the tools that make sense. And if using the National Guard, which is folks I think in New York state are already using the National Guard, that is something that has to be done.  This is clearly, as the vice president indicated, a national emergency. And what I worry about is not only how we respond aggressively to the virus, but also how we respond aggressively to the economic fallout of a global recession.  So right now, in Illinois and Ohio, if my memory is correct, the governor there has said they're closing down bars, they're closing down restaurants. What happens to the workers who are there? What happens to the millions of workers who may end up losing their jobs?  So what I think we have got to do right now is, if Trump can provide or the Fed can provide a trillion and a half to -- for liquidity for the banks, what we've got to say to every worker in America, you know what, don't panic. You're not going to -- you'll be able to pay your mortgage, because you're going to get a check.  BASH: Senator...  SANDERS: You're going to be made whole.  BASH: Senator, we're going to talk about the economic -- oh, go ahead, Mr. Vice President.  BIDEN: The answer is I would call out the military.  BASH: OK.  BIDEN: Now. They have the capacity to provide this surge, help that hospitals need, and that is needed across the nation. I would make sure that they did exactly what they're prepared to do. They've done it. They did it in the Ebola crisis. They've done it. They have the capacity to build 500-bed hospitals and -- and tents that are completely safe and secure, and provide the help to get it done to anybody -- this overflow. So it is a national emergency. I would call out the military.  SANDERS: Well, the Ebola crisis is one thing. This is, obviously, a pandemic, which is far more severe and impactful to this country. And I think one of the things that we want to remember here is that we got a lot of elderly people in this country who are told stay home, don't leave your house. Who's going to get food to them? How do we get food to them?  You got schools all over this country now being shut down. OK? How are we going to make sure that the kids do well in this crisis, not become traumatized? What do we do about the parents now who have to stay home with kids and can't go to work?  So I think what -- bottom line here is that, in this crisis, we have got to start paying attention to the most vulnerable. That includes people who are in prison right now, people who are in homeless shelters right now. What about the half-a-million people who are homeless tonight? Who's going to respond to them?  Now, in 2008, when we had the Wall Street bailout, they did very well for the people on top. They bailed out the crooks on Wall Street. They forgot about the suffering of ordinary Americans. This time around, let us learn that lesson. Let us pay attention to the working families of this country...  BASH: Thank you, Senator.  SANDERS: ... and to the most vulnerable.  BIDEN: We have -- we have learned that lesson. And again, I lay out in detail what we should be doing now is we should be surging help to those places which are the most vulnerable. We should have every single person that's in a nursing home being able to be tested. We should be moving forces in to do that. We should move in the capability to do that.  We should be sitting down -- the president should be sitting down in the Situation Room right now and do what we did before and asking the question, OK, you're going to close everything. Well, if you close everything, how do you get prescriptions that have to be filled?  [20:20:00] How do you make sure, when you close that school, those children are going to be able to get the school food program? How do you make sure that you're going to be able to see to it that you get your mortgage paid?  I propose that all of the be covered, and it's going to take a multi- multi-billion dollar program to do that.  But first things first, the first thing is take care of the immediate needs we have now relating to surging the kind of capability that we have to prevent this great bump in terms of this -- how it's going to cause such pain as well as moving in the direction of making sure we have a long-term plan to make sure it's...  (CROSSTALK)  BASH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We're going to talk in a moment a lot more about the economic impact.  But first, Senator Sanders, I want to ask about China. When this outbreak first started in China, the government there censored the whistleblower doctor who sounded the alarm and downplayed the true gravity of the the virus.  SANDERS: Right.  BASH: What consequences should China face for its role in this global crisis?  SANDERS: Well, one of the consequences is we have got to learn that you cannot lie to the American people. You cannot be less than frank about the a nature of the crisis. And what bothers me very much is you have a president of the United States today, Mr. Trump, who is praising China for the good work that they are doing when, in fact, as you indicated, they were lying to their own people and allowing that virus to move much more aggressively than should have been the case.  Look, I don't think this is the time for recrimination, to be punishing people. Now is the time, by the way, to be working with China. They are learning a lot about this crisis. And, in fact, they -- you know, we have got to work with them. We have got to work with the World Health Organization. We have got to work with Italy. We have got to work with countries around the world.  If there was ever a moment when the entire world is in this together, got to support each other, this is that moment.  BIDEN: That's right. And if I may respond, that's why I insisted the moment this broke out that we should insist on having our experts in China, in China to see what was happening and make it clear to China there would be consequences if we did not have that access.  And we have to lead the world. We should be the ones doing what we did during the Ebola crisis, bringing the whole world together and saying, this is what we must do. We have to have a common plan. All nations are affected the same way by this virus depending on exposure. And so this is -- we need world leadership. We need international  leadership. We need someone who knows how to bring the world together and insist on fundamental change in the way in which we're approaching this.  CALDERON: Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: Well, the bottom line here is that in the midst of this crisis, we have got to act in an unprecedented way. And that means every country on Earth is going to be affected. Every country on Earth has got to work together. It also means that we tell the pharmaceutical industry, we tell the big money interests that this is not a time for profiteering. This is a time for all of us working together.  The World Health Organization is a very, very strong organization. It is sad that we have a president that has ignored the international community in so many ways, including in terms of international health crises.  CALDERON: Thank you, Senator Sanders.  Obviously, another part of this story is the economy, which is reeling from this pandemic. Many economies are warning of a recession. Just hours ago the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero percent, which has not happened since the financial crisis in 2008.  Vice President Biden, what would you do?  BIDEN: What I would do is make it clear to the world and make it clear to the United States that we are going to have to have a major, major, major, major bailout package that we do not reward corporations. We reward individuals who in fact are really put to the test here.  The problem is the policies of this administration economically have -- we've eaten a lot of our seed corn here. The ability for us to use levers that were available before have been used up by this godawful tax cut of $1.9 trillion, by the fact that we have used -- the Fed will be of little consequence now. They have already used what leverage they have.  And so we're going to have to just level with the American people. And here's the deal, we're going to have to not only deal with the immediate crisis, economic crisis, which is the most critical now, to let people know their mortgage is going to be paid. Their rents are going to be paid. They are going to have child care. They are going to make sure that all their medical bills are cared for relating to this, et cetera.  We have to go beyond that. And we're going to have be in a situation where we're meeting on a daily basis like we did in the middle of the financial crisis to decide how we are going to find the wherewithal and the money to be able to see to it we hold all these folks harmless.  [20:25:00]  But not, not do what Trump wants to do. He's -- for example, he came along and said, I've got a great idea, let's -- well, you're going to tell me...  CALDERON: Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: The Ebola crisis, in my view, exposes the dysfunctionality of the health care system and how poorly prepared we are despite how much money that we spend. And the Ebola crisis is also, I think, exposing the cruelty and the unjustness of our economy today.  We have more income and wealth inequality in America today than any time in 100 years. And what that means that in the midst of this crisis, you know, if you're a multimillionaire, no one is happy about this crisis, you're going to get through it. You're going to get everything you need. You're not worried about health care. You're not worried about income coming in.  Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. We've got people who are struggling working two or three jobs to put food on the table. What is going to happen to them? So the lesson to be learned is we have got to move aggressively right now to address the economic crisis as a result of Ebola -- as a result -- keep talking about Ebola, you've got Ebola in my head here right now.  As a result of the virus here, the coronavirus, what we have got to do also is understand the fragility of the economy and how unjust and unfair it is that so few have so much and so many have so little.  BIDEN: People are looking for results, not a revolution. They want to deal with the results they need right now. And we can to that by making sure that we make everybody whole who has been so badly hurt. In terms of their -- they lose the job, in terms of not having the ability to care for their children, in terms of the health care costs that they have relating to the crisis, we can make them whole now, now, and put in process a system whereby they all are made whole.  That has nothing to do with the legitimate concern about income inequality in America. That's real. That's real. But that does not affect the need for us to act swiftly and very thoroughly and in concert with all of the forces that we need to bring to bear to deal with the crisis now so no one is thrown out of their home. No one loses their mortgage. No one is kicked out of their house. No one loses their paycheck. No one is in a position where they have a significant financial disability as a consequence of this SARS (ph) -- of this particular crisis.  CALDERON: Thank you, Vice President.  Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: Well, I think it goes without saying that as a nation we have to respond as forcefully as we can to the current crisis. But it is not good enough not to be understanding how we got here and where we want to go into the future. So how does it happen that today in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, half of our people are scared to death?  Good, I agree. In fact, that was my idea originally to make sure that every person in this country is made whole as a result of this crisis. But, God willing, this crisis is going to end. And we're going to have to develop an economy in which half of our people are not living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to put food on the table.  BIDEN: I don't disagree with that. Let's -- you were asking about the crisis. What are we going to do about the crisis now, which is incredibly consequential to millions and millions of Americans? And it's not going to be solved by a change in tax policy now. It's not going to be solved by a change in how we deal with health care.  It has got to be solved with an emergency need right now. Right now, what do we do? First thing we do is we make sure that health care is available by us having the tools to be able to deal with it. And that requires us to go out and do much more than this president has done in terms of planning.  Secondly, it requires us to be in a position where we're anticipating what will happen in the next month or weeks in terms of the flow into the health care system by bringing the military along, more hospital beds, more training, more equipment, more equipment to save the first responders as well.  In addition to that, we then have to also look at what are the immediate needs right today. How about that person who has been laid off today? How about that person who doesn't have an income today? They have to know that tomorrow that when the paycheck comes due, you will get that paycheck.  And thirdly, we have to think long-term about how we deal with making all those who have been badly damaged right again. And then we move on. Then we move on to change the economy in ways that are more profoundly necessary than people think, but do not respond to the immediate needs we have now. First things first.  CALDERON: Thank you, Vice President.  Senator Sanders, you voted against bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis.  SANDERS: Yes.  [20:30:00]  CALDERON: Many believe those spending bills were a crucial part of stabilizing the economy back then. Would you support bailouts for industries that are being crushed by the coronavirus outbreak now?  SANDERS: I did, you're quite right. I voted against the bailout because I believed that the illegal behavior being done by the people on Wall Street should not be rewarded by a bailout. And today, by the way, those banks are more prosperous and own more assets, by and large, than they did back then. They are bigger now than they were then. I thought at the time that in the midst of massive income and wealth  inequality the people on top, through a surtax on the very wealthy, should bail out. And it's not just the TARP bailout. We gave trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to large banks.  But to answer your question where we are right now, we need to stabilize the economy, but we can't repeat what we did in 2008. Joe voted for that. I voted against it. Because we have got to do more than save the banks or the oil companies. Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country, no matter what your income is, you are not going to suffer as a result of this crisis of which you had no control.  CALDERON: Vice President Biden?  BIDEN: Had those banks all gone under, all those people Bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble. Deep, deep trouble. All those little folks, we would have gone out of business. They would find themselves in position where they would lose everything they had in that bank, whether it was $10 or $300 or a savings account.  This was about saving an economy. And it did save the economy. And the banks paid back. And they paid back with interest. I agree with Bernie. Someone should have gone to jail. That was the big disagreement I had in terms of bailing out. But the question was, they paid back.  In addition to that, it also -- part of that was bailing out the automobile industry. Saving thousands of jobs. Tens of thousands of jobs over time. He voted against that as well.  SANDERS: No. I did not vote against that. That bailout money was used later on by Bush to protect the automobile industry.  But here's the point.  (CROSSTALK)  SANDERS: One minute, one minute. Here's the point here, is that in terms of that bailout, there are ways that you can bail out. When you have a handful of people who have incredible wealth who have prospered off of the illegal behavior of individuals, in this case on Wall Street, you know what you say to them? And I did. I said this to the secretary of treasury. You want a bailout? That's fine. Have your friends pay for it, not working people.  The other point is, Joe should know, it wasn't just the $700 billion TARP program. The Fed gave trillions and trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to every financial institution in this country and central banks all over the world. That was essentially a grant. Because they then could sell that -- they could then bring in interest rates much greater than the zero interest loans that they got.  CALDERON: Vice President Biden?  BIDEN: Look, the fact of the matter is that if, in fact, the banks had all been -- gone under, we would be in a great depression. We would have not -- how do you get out of that? Now Bernie is saying that I guess he's going to do a wealth tax or something, that the top 1 percent could pay for everything. And they should pay for everything that occurred.  We were talking about tens and hundreds of billions of dollars. That's what this was about. And the fact was that it saved the economy from going into a depression. After we passed the Recovery Act, which I was the one that went out and got the three votes to get it changed, that had $900 billion in it and was the thing that kept us from going into a great depression.  CALDERON: Vice President Biden, I'm going to stay with you. Many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants and now even many legal immigrants in the United States are afraid to seek medical help. How do you ensure they feel safe enough to get treatment to help stop the spread of coronavirus?  BIDEN: Anyone who shows up to be tested for coronavirus or gets coronavirus and is treated would be held harmless. Just like I have argued all along. Any woman who crosses the border or is here and being beaten by her husband but she's undocumented, she cannot be deported because she reports.  There are certain things you cannot deport an undocumented alien for -- an undocumented person for. And that would be one of them. We want them -- it's in the interest of everyone. And those folks who are the xenophobic folks out there, it's even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly.  They will not, should not under any circumstances be held accountable and be deported for that purpose, period.  [20:35:00]  SANDERS: I have been criticized because the proposal for Medicare for All that I introduced includes making sure that undocumented people are also covered.  And right now, we have the absurd situation where undocumented people who try to do the right thing -- they're sick; they want to go to the doctor; they don't want to spread this disease -- are now standing and thinking about when ICE is going to deport them.  So one of the things that we have to do is to make sure that everybody feels comfortable getting the health care that they need. That should be a general principle, above and beyond the coronavirus.  Second of all, we've got to end these terrible ICE raids, which are terrorizing communities all over this country.  And thirdly, to answer your question, the time is long overdue for this country to move to comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for those 11 million undocumented. And furthermore, on day one as president, I would restore the legal status of the 1.8 million...  BASH: Senator -- Senator thank you...  SANDERS: young people of DACA.  BASH: We're going to talk about immigration in a minute. But first I want to ask about something that's going on right now, again, back to this crisis.  We know that people over the age of 60 and those with underlying medical conditions, especially heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, are the most vulnerable to coronavirus and are being asked to change their behavior to protect themselves.  So Senator Sanders, I'll start with you. You're 78 years old. You had a heart attack. What are you doing to protect yourself?  SANDERS: Well, a great deal. I mean, last night we had a -- a fireside chat, not a rally. I love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies. I enjoy it very much. We're not doing that right now. In fact, our entire staff is working from home.  So on a personal level, what we're doing is I'm not shaking hands. Joe and I did not shake hands.  (LAUGHTER)  And I am very careful about the people I am interacting with. I'm using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection. And I have to say, you know, thank God, right now, I do not have any symptoms and I feel very grateful for that.  BASH: Vice President Biden, you're 77. What are you doing to protect yourself?  BIDEN: Well, fortunately, I don't have any of the underlying conditions you talked about that I have to worry about, number one.  Number two, thank God, for the time being -- anything can happen, as my mother would say, knock on wood, that I'm in good health.  Number three, I'm taking all the precautions anyone would take, whether they are 30 years old or 60 years old or 80 years old. And that is I'm going to make sure that I do not -- I do not shake hands any longer; I do not engage -- we did the same thing. Our staff is all working from home. We are not doing rallies any longer. We're doing virtual rallies. We're doing virtual town hall meetings.  We're in a situation where now I do not -- as I said, when we encounter people, we're not going into crowds. And so I'm taking all the precautions everyone else should be taking. I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap. I carry with me -- as a matter of fact, I have it in my bag outside here -- hand sanitizer. I don't know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don't touch my face, and so on. So I'm taking all the precautions we're told for everybody else to take.  TAPPER: Let's turn to the race more broadly now. Throughout this campaign, you have each laid out starkly different visions for how to bring about change.  Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. You said people want results, not a revolution. Make the case for why a revolution is not what the country needs or wants.  BIDEN: We have problems we have to solve now -- now. What's a revolution going to do, disrupt everything in the meantime?  Look, Bernie talks about -- excuse me -- the senator talks about his Medicare For All. He still hasn't told you how he's going to ever get it passed. He hasn't told you how in fact there's any possibility of that happening. He hasn't told you how much it's going to cost. He hasn't told you how it's going to apply. It doesn't kick in for four years even after it passes.  We want a revolution, let's act now. Pass the Biden health care plan, which takes Obamacare, restores all the cuts made to it, subsidizes it further, provides for lower drug prices, makes sure that there's no hidden bills, makes sure that we invest -- what I want to invest, $50 billion in dealing with underlying diseases that are of great consequence, diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer. Make sure that we have a Medicare option that's in a -- a public option providing Medicare for us.  We can do that now. I can get that passed. I can get that done, if I'm president of the United States of America. That will be a fundamental change, and it happens now.  I can tell you from experience, being a significant consumer of health care, with my sons, my family, all the things we've gone through, what people want is hope, and they need it now, not four years from now. And Bernie still hasn't cost -- told us how he's going to pay for it. We're talking about a...  SANDERS: Not quite true.  BIDEN: ... 30-plus trillion dollar plan.  SANDERS: Not quite true.  TAPPER: Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: Look, let's do something that is very rarely done in the Congress.  [20:40:00]  BIDEN: OK.  SANDERS: Let's do something that the media doesn't do. Let's talk about the reality of American life. Why is it that, over the last 45 years, despite the huge increase in productivity and technology, the average worker today is not making a nickel more in real dollars?  Why is it that, over the last 30 years, the richest 1 percent have seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth; the bottom half of America, a $900 billion decline in their wealth?  Why is that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right?  Why are we the only major country not to have paid medical and family leave?  Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires when half a million people are homeless today?  And it comes down to something, Jake, we don't talk about, the power structure in America. Who has the power?  And I'll tell you who has the power. It's the people who contribute money, the billionaires who contribute money to political campaigns, who control the legislative agenda. Those people have the power.  And if you want to make real changes in this country; if you want to create an economy that works for all, not just the few; if you want to guarantee quality health care to all, not make $100 billion in profit for the health care industry, you know what you need?  You need to take on Wall Street; you need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry. You don't take campaign contributions from them. You take them on and create an economy that works for all.  BIDEN: You want to do that, do what I proposed over 30 years ago. Federally fund all elections, no private contributions in the election process. If you want to do that, join me. Join me and my constitutional amendment that I've been proposing. Maybe you and I can work on that together. Because that would fundamentally change it.  And the complication is I'm getting these -- I've not accepted a contribution from anybody over $2,800, number one. My average contribution is $44. Just this month I've raised $33 million, average contribution, $51. The idea that this is -- Bernie's implication is somehow I'm being funded by millionaires.  Bernie, look, in the last -- in Super Tuesday and before that, Bernie outspent me two, three, four, five, six to one. And I still won. I didn't have any money. And I still won.  TAPPER: Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: It's good that you had an idea 30 years ago. I don't want to join you. Why don't you join me?  Why don't you get rid of the SuperPAC that you have right now -- which is running very ugly negative ads about me, by the way...  (LAUGHTER)  SANDERS: Don't laugh, Joe. That's just the truth.  (LAUGHTER)  And they've got two other SuperPACs runnings ads against us.  Why don't you just say, right now -- go on television and say, \"Hey, you know what\" -- I think, in the past, Joe, if I'm not mistaken, you condemned SuperPACs. Is that correct?  BIDEN: You get rid of the nine Super PACs you have?  SANDERS: I don't -- nine...  (LAUGHTER)  I don't have any SuperPACs.  BIDEN: You have nine. Do you want me to list them?  SANDERS: No -- yeah. You go ahead and list them.  BIDEN: OK. Come on. Give me a break. Come on.  SANDERS: No, I won't give you a break on this one, Joe. You condemn SuperPACs. You've got a SuperPAC is running negative -- but here's the point. This is the point. In the richest country in the history of the world, half of our people should not be struggling to put food on the table.  And the reason for that is you have a political structure in which big money interests not only dominate the political system but dominate our economy as well. Somebody makes a decision we're going to shut down a factory in America; we're going to move to China; we're going to move to Mexico, pay people starvation wages there.  This is an issue that has got to be ultimately deal with. Who has the power in America? Are we content with so few exercising so much power when so many people have given up on the political process?  BIDEN: I proposed a significant change in the tax code and I've been proposing it for a long, long time, number one.  Number two, it's not just about taxing the super-wealthy. It's about making sure everybody pays their fair share. For example, I can pay for my whole health care plan by changing the way in which we deal with capital gains. People should pay their capital gains based on what their income tax is and not 20 percent.  That would raise $800 billion, pay for my entire medical health care plan, which would cover everyone.  The fact of the matter is, everything I call for, I pay for. And I do not believe, and I have not supported these exorbitant tax cuts for the wealthy. I strongly opposed the -- the tax cut that this president has put through of $1.9 trillion. And I said at the time this was all about trying to eliminate the safety net.  Look, the idea that Bernie implies, the way he says things, speaking of negative ads, my Lord, Bernie, you're running an ad saying I'm opposed to Social Security, that Politifact says is a flat lie, and that The Washington Post said is a flat lie.  SANDERS: Oh, well, let me ask you a question, Joe.  BIDEN: Yeah.  SANDERS: You're right here with me.  BIDEN: Yeah.  SANDERS: Have you been on the floor of the Senate -- you were in the Senate for a few years...  BIDEN: Yep.  [20:45:00]  SANDERS: ... time and time again talking about the necessity -- with pride -- about cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, cutting veterans' programs.  BIDEN: No.  SANDERS: You never said that?  BIDEN: No.  SANDERS: All right. America, go to the website right now. Go to the YouTube right now. Time after time -- you were not a fan of Bowles- Simpson?  BIDEN: I was not a fan of Bowles...  SANDERS: You were not a fan of the Balanced Budget Amendment, which called for cuts in Social Security?  Come on, Joe, you were.  BIDEN: Look, here's the deal.  SANDERS: You're an honest guy. Why don't you just tell the truth here? We all make mistakes.  BIDEN: No, I am telling the truth. You said that I in fact -- why am I rated 96 percent by the Social Security organizations?  Why am I viewed as a strong supporter...  SANDERS: All that I said...  BIDEN: I have laid out how I will increase Social Security.  SANDERS: Well, that's good. I laid that out...  BIDEN: I have laid out how I'm going to make sure...  SANDERS: OK, let me...  BIDEN: ... that it is in fact paid for.  SANDERS: Jake...  BIDEN: Go to joebiden.com, look at my exchange with Paul Ryan on his desire to try to privatize and/or cut Social Security...  SANDERS: OK.  BIDEN: ... and understand how he manipulated an ad.  SANDERS: No -- all right. Let me repeat it again. I want you just to be straight with the American people. I am saying that you have been on the floor of the Senate, time and time again, talking about the need to cut Social Security, Medicare and veterans' programs. Is that true or is that not true?  BIDEN: No, it's not true.  SANDERS: That is not true?  BIDEN: That is not true.  What is true is, in terms of the negotiations that are taking place, how to deal with the deficit, everything was on the table. I did not support any of those cuts, in Social Security or in veterans' benefits...  SANDERS: Whoa -- whoa -- you -- everything was on the table. All right. You're right. You just said it -- including, in your judgment, cuts to Social Security and veterans...  BIDEN: In order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related...  SANDERS: Joe, then you just...  BIDEN: But we didn't -- but we did not cut it. I did not vote for it.  SANDERS: I know, because people like me helped stop that.  BIDEN: Oh, come on, Bernie.  SANDERS: But, Joe, you just contradicted yourself.  (CROSSTALK)  BIDEN: Joe, you just contradicted yourself. One minute...  (CROSSTALK) BIDEN: Excuse me. One minute you said \"I was not on the floor.\" The next minute you say, \"Well, yes, there was a reason why I was worried about the deficit.\"  Maybe that's good reason, maybe it's not. All that I am saying is you were prepared to cut and advocated for the cuts of programs...  (CROSSTALK)  BASH: So let me...  BIDEN: I did not. I never voted to cut Social Security.  SANDERS: I'm not talking about voting, Joe. That's not what I said.  BIDEN: I never voted -- well, look, I voted to protect it. I was -- just go look at the debate with Paul Ryan for the vice presidency. Look at what I did.  And, Bernie, will you acknowledge your campaign took out of context that whole exchange between Paul Ryan. Are you saying Politifact is wrong? Are you saying...  (CROSSTALK)  SANDERS: Well, believe me, The Washington Post, Politifact is wrong a whole lot of times. But...  BIDEN: Are they wrong on that, Bernie? Are they wrong on that, Bernie?  SANDERS: Joe...  BIDEN: Bernie, did you...  (CROSSTALK)  SANDERS: Did -- Joe, wait a minute. I'll answer your question. You answer mine.  BIDEN: I answered yours.  SANDERS: No, you didn't.  BIDEN: All right.  SANDERS: One more time. Were you on the floor, time and time again, for whatever reason, talking about the need to cut Social Security and Medicare and veterans' programs?  BIDEN: No, I did not talk about the need to cut any of those programs.  SANDERS: OK. All that I would say to the American people, go to YouTube. It's all over the place. Joe said it many, many times. And I'm surprised -- you know, you can defend or change your mind on it, but you can't deny the reality.  BASH: So, Senator, because you brought up Social Security and you have been talking about it, I want to ask you about something that you wrote in 1996. You were a member of the House and you wrote an op-ed that said, quote, \"It is clear we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits.\"  SANDERS: Yeah.  BASH: Why are your past comments any less relevant than the vice president's?  SANDERS: Incremental adjustments. What I advocated -- adjustments that I advocated and have advocated for years is among other things increasing the cost of living assistance.  No, you're not going to find me ever calling for cuts to Social Security. Right now, for example, we determined (inaudible) looking at inflation for the general population rather than segregating the higher costs that seniors are paying for prescription drugs and for health care. That's what I was talking about.  I have -- in fact, when Joe and others were enamored with the so- called Bowles-Simpson, which included cuts to Social Security or raising the retirement age, I formed, along with people like Barbara Boxer, the Defending Social Security Caucus to say, no, when 20 percent of our seniors are trying to get by on $13,000 a year or more, we are not going to cut Social Security.  CALDERON: Vice President Biden, yesterday you endorsed an Elizabeth Warren plan that would undo key parts of the bankruptcy law you helped pass in 2005. A few hours ago, you announced support for making public college tuition-free for families who make less than $125,000 a year, something Senator Sanders has supported. What changed?  BIDEN: Two things. Number one, let's talk about the bankruptcy bill.  [20:50:00]  The bankruptcy bill was passing overwhelmingly, and I improved it. I had a choice, it was going to pass, Republican president, Republican Congress, and I offered two amendments to make sure that people under $50,000 would not be affected and women and children would go to the front of the line on alimony and support payments. That's what I did. It passed overwhelmingly. I did not like the rest of the bill, but I improved it, number one.  Number two, I've talked with Senator Warren about her proposal. This is the first opportunity we've had to make substantial change in what we couldn't get done in a Republican administration. That's why we talked last -- two nights ago, and I supported her proposal. And it's a good proposal, it's a solid proposal. And she should get credit for having introduced it.  With regard to what we're talking about in terms of college education, I've been saying for a long time that we're in a position where 12 years of education is not enough, is not enough for the 21st century. We need 16 years of education. The exact bill that the -- that Senator Sanders introduced of -- I guess a little over a year ago, capping it off at $125,000 in income, you could get free up to that point, after that, you'd have to pay for your college education, it'd only work for public schools and it would work for public universities in your state. I support that idea.  It was a good idea. And I support it. And so that's -- that's what it is. And I'm not saying everything Bernie said has been wrong. He happens to be right on that one.  CALDERON: Senator Sanders, I assume you welcome these changes?  SANDERS: Look, this is a little bit about leadership, as well. Joe talked about bankruptcy. Joe, if I memory is correct, you helped write that bankruptcy bill.  BIDEN: I did not.  SANDERS: All right.  BIDEN: I did not.  SANDERS: And that bankruptcy bill -- by the way, we talk about education, we've got 45 million people in America struggling with student debt. Some of them really struggling with student debt. And that bankruptcy bill made it impossible or very difficult for people to escape from that student debt. It was a very, very bad bill.  You said, Joe, that a majority of the people in the Senate voted for it. You're right.  BIDEN: Overwhelming majority.  SANDERS: Overwhelmingly. Well, I voted against it in the House and I was right. And I don't have to rethink my position, because that's what leadership is about, having the guts to take an unpopular vote.  But it's not just bankruptcy. The difference between Joe and I on higher education is, four years ago, it was not a popular idea, Joe. Glad you're coming around now. Four years ago, when I said that public colleges and university should be tuition free, people were saying, Bernie, that's a radical idea. Well, you got states and cities and counties all over the country that are moving in that direction.  And I'm glad that Joe is on board. But what leadership is about is going forward when it's not popular, when it's an idea that you get criticized for. So I'm proud of that fact, and I'm proud of my leadership on many issues. Joe, since the campaign, has come around. I talked about raising that minimum wage $15 bucks an hour four years ago, Joe.  BIDEN: So did I. And I went out and campaigned for it.  SANDERS: Fifteen dollars an hour? BIDEN: Fifteen dollars an hour. New York City. Go talk to the governor.  SANDERS: I will talk to the governor.  BIDEN: All right?  SANDERS: I am not aware of that. I am not aware of that.  BIDEN: You should be aware. Look...  SANDERS: Four years ago, it was a radical idea. Very few people in Congress were talking about it.  BIDEN: I wasn't in...  CALDERON: Go ahead, Vice President.  BIDEN: Well, here, look. Let's get something straight about the bankruptcy bill. The bankruptcy bill already -- it did not affect student debt for 90 percent, because the law had already been passed. You could not declare bankruptcy for those loans that were from private institutions. You couldn't do it. And so the bankruptcy bill didn't affect that. It affected 10 percent of the people, the first bankruptcy bill, 10 percent of the student loans, number one.  Number two, now we're in a position where we're able to correct that problem. The fact is if I hadn't stepped up and changed the law as it relates to people making less than $50,000, those for alimony and child support, then, guess what, they would have been in the bucket, too. It was going to pass anyway. I made it -- let me finish. I made it incrementally better. I did not like the bill. I did not support the bill. And I made it clear to the industry I didn't like the bill.  Number two, this bill now calls for the opportunity to fundamentally change the mistakes we couldn't correct in the bill the first time around. And that is why I support Elizabeth Warren's idea. And it's a very good idea.  CALDERON: Senator Sanders, go ahead.  SANDERS: Well, this is kind of circular logic. We're going to reform the bill that I voted for. Well, if you hadn't voted for it, and if you had rallied other people, as I tried to do in the House voting against it, we might not have the problems with it we have today.  You know, what leadership is about, Joe, and it deals with -- you know, whether your opposition -- or your support, I should say, for legislation -  [20:55:00]  for legislation regarding gay communities in the so-called Defense of Marriage Act. You remember that bill, right? You remember the Defense of Marriage Act? BIDEN: I sure do.  SANDERS: It was -- you know, gay marriage today is considered a Little bit differently than it was 25 years ago. I remember that vote. It was a very hard vote. I voted against the Defense of Marriage Act. You voted for it. I voted against the bankruptcy bill. You voted for it. I voted against the war in Iraq, which was also a tough vote. You voted for it.  I voted against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR with China, which cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs. You voted for it. I voted against the Hyde amendment, which denies low- income women the right to get an abortion. You have consistently voted for it. I don't know what your position is on it today, but you have consistently voted for it.  In other words, all that I'm saying here, we can argue about the merits of the bill.  CALDERON: Vice President Biden...  SANDERS: It takes courage sometimes to go do the right thing.  BIDEN: You can argue about the past or the future. This man voted against the Brady bill five times, background checks, background checks, five times, number one.  Number two, this man is the only -- one of the few Democrats I know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued. Talk about a special, special interest. We can sue -- we should be able to sue drug companies. We should be able to sue tobacco companies. We cannot sue the gun manufacturers because he voted for that years ago. He says it was a mistake now. I'm prepared to accept he says it's a mistake. The question is, what do we do from this point on?  And by the way, I might add, I'm the first person to go on national television in any administration and say I supported gay marriage. I supported gay marriage when asked. And I -- so -- and it started a ripple effect. I'm not taking all credit for it, but I'm the first major player to say I support gay marriage on national television.  SANDERS: All that I'm saying here is...  BIDEN: Leadership.  SANDERS: ... we can argue, you know, this or that bill. But what I'm suggesting is that, in this time of crisis, when we're living in a really, really unsettling world, economically, from a health care with the coronavirus, the people of America know my record, OK? For 30 years, I have stood with the working families of this country. I have taken on every special interest there is out there. And that is what I will do in the White House. That's a very different record than Joes.  BIDEN: That is not a different record than mine. SANDERS: That is a totally different record than yours, all right? I mean, it's manifested in this campaign when you're, you know, getting all this money from, you know, wealthy people and billionaires. So I think if -- if you want somebody who will take to the White House what I have done for my whole life...  TAPPER: Thank you, Senator Sanders.  SANDERS: ... and that is take on special interests, I think I'm that candidate.  BIDEN: The average campaign contribution, $44 dollars.  TAPPER: Let's talk about the future, Vice President Biden. If you become the Democratic presidential nominee, how will you appeal to supporters of Senator Sanders when you do disagree on so many issues?  BIDEN: He's making it hard for me right now. I was trying to give him credit for some things. He won't even take the credit for things he wants to do.  Look, I think that -- I want to make it clear. If Bernie is the nominee, I will not only support him, I will campaign for him. And I believe the people who support me will do the same thing, because the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump. It's critical. I would hope that Bernie would do the same thing if I'm the nominee and encourage all of his followers to, in fact, support me, as well, because it's much bigger than either of us.  Character of the nation is on the ballot. It goes well beyond whether or not -- Senator Sanders and I both agree we need Medicare -- health care should be a right, not a privilege. We both agree we have to give -- deal with student debt. We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education. We both agree that we deal -- we have a new green deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity.  We disagree on the detail of how we do it. But we don't disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything. This is a man who wants to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, not -- not Bernie, the president of the United States.  So this is much bigger than whether or not I'm the nominee or Bernie is the nominee. We must defeat Donald Trump. He is the -- four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a nation. We've got to restore this country's soul. That's essential. And as long as this president is there, we're not going to be able to do it.  TAPPER: Senator Sanders, if...  SANDERS: Can I just say a word, then I'll respond to your...  TAPPER: Well, it's just a quick question, which is, if he is the nominee, Vice President Biden, you've already said you would support him. SANDERS: Of course.  TAPPER: But will you campaign for him?  SANDERS: Sure.  TAPPER: Will you urge supporters to support him?  SANDERS: Look, on day one, when I announced my candidacy, what I said is this country  [21:00:00]  cannot deal with a president who is a pathological liar, who is running a corrupt administration and obviously doesn't know the Constitution of the United States, who believes is above the law, who is a racist and a sexist and a homophone. He is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country.  And what I said on day one, Joe, day one, that obviously I hope to win the nomination, but if I don't win the nomination, I -- and I think every over Democratic candidate -- is prepared to come together to do everything humanly possible to defeat Donald Trump.  But let me respond to something that Joe said. You know, we talk about the Green New Deal and all of these things in general terms, but details make a difference. What I have said throughout this campaign -- and I don't think I've heard you say this, Joe, is that if we're going to -- if we're going to save this planet for our kids and future generations, we need to have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry and make it clear to them that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. And we have a very detailed planet -- detailed proposal. Happy to get the endorsement of the Sunrise Movement, the young people...  TAPPER: We're -- we're going to get into the Green New Deal.  SANDERS: OK.  TAPPER: We're going to talk about climate change. We have to squeeze in a quick break. When we come back, the CNN-Univision presidential debate will return. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  [21:07:10]  BASH: Welcome back to the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate, live from Washington, D.C. And as we noted, Arizona will vote on Tuesday. We solicited questions from undecided Democratic voters there. One is from Amy Langenfeld, who is a law professor from Chandler, Arizona, with a question for Senator Sanders.  QUESTION: Women are the canaries in the coalmine of the conservative agenda. Our access to health care is at risk from the Federalist Society's remaking of the courts. Our lives are threatened by abusive partners' access to guns. Women are disproportionately affected by bail requirements (ph), Social Security cuts, and cuts to public education. How will your cabinet ensure the best advice on issues that affect women's physical and financial health? Thank you.  SANDERS: My cabinet, my administration will look like America. Last I heard, over half of the people in America are women. And that will be the representation in my cabinet and my administration.  And in terms of policies, unlike Joe, I have consistently believed and have a 100 percent lifetime voting record from groups like NARAL, that it is a woman's right to control her own body, not the government.  I have believed that we have got to move aggressively to deal with domestic violence in this country. I have aggressively -- and I think effectively -- made the case that we cannot have women in America earning 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. And if you're a minority woman, it's 50 or 60 cents on the dollar.  We need to have universal, affordable, high-quality childcare, so women who are single or married can go off to work and know that their kids are going to be well taken care of. So I think if you look at my agenda, which is on berniesanders.com, what you will find, it is a very strong agenda in fighting for the rights of women who today are under incredible political assault by Trump and Republican governors all across this country.  BASH: Vice President Biden?  BIDEN: Am I able to respond to that?  BASH: Please.  BIDEN: Yes, thank you. Number one, I agree with -- with the question of the -- the underlying premise of Amy's question. Number one, I committed that if I'm elected president, have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts, will be -- I'll appoint the first black woman to the courts. It's required that they have representation now. It's long overdue.  Secondly, if I'm elected president, my -- my cabinet, my administration will look like the country. And I commit that I will, in fact, appoint a -- I'll pick a woman to be vice president. There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.  Number three, I'm the guy that wrote the domestic violence law. And I'm the guy that put in the prohibitions that no one who abuses someone else should be able to own a gun, period. They should not be able to own a gun. I would get the boyfriend exception amended now. I've gotten it passed that if you are -- got a stay away order from a court, you have a child with someone, that you cannot own a gun. No one should be able to own a gun who has abused a woman, period.  BASH: Mr. Vice President, if I could just follow up, just to be clear, you just committed here tonight that your running mate, if you get the nomination, will be a woman? BIDEN: Yes.  SANDERS: Let me...  BASH: Senator Sanders, will you make that same statement?  SANDERS: May I just respond and ask Joe a question?  BASH: Please.  SANDERS: Right now, a woman's right to control her own body is under massive assault, unpredictable assault.  BIDEN: It is.  SANDERS: Joe, you have in the past on more than one occasion voted for the  [21:10:00]  Hyde amendment, which says that a woman, low-income woman, could not use Medicaid funding for an abortion. Is that still your view? Or have you modified it?  [21:10:00]  BIDEN: It's not my view. And by the way, everybody who has been in the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another because it was locked in other bills.  The reason why I affirmatively came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all health care along the line, there's no way you could allow for there to be a requirement that you have Hyde Amendment, a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care.  (CROSSTALK)  SANDERS: Well, I'm glad...  BIDEN: Number two -- and I've done that -- I did that a while ago, OK? Number one.  Number two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress, when I'm elected president -- if I'm elected president, a codification of Roe v. Wade amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose. I think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. And, in fact, I have gotten 100 percent rating from NARAL as well.  BASH: Senator Sanders, before we move on, I just want to get you to respond.  SANDERS: Excuse me, you have a lifetime 100 percent voting record from NARAL?  BIDEN: I know my record of late from NARAL has been 100 percent. I don't know whether it was 25 years ago.  SANDERS: Well, all right. I mean, I think one of the differences, not to, you know, pick a bone here, is I have been consistent. All right? I have always believed in that. And you have not. I'm glad you have changed your views.  BASH: Senator, just to be clear, the vice president committed to picking a woman as his running mate. If you get the nomination, will you?  SANDERS: In all likelihood, I will. For me, it's not just nominating a woman, it is making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there. So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.  CALDERON: Let's turn now to immigration. Vice President Biden, you have recently said for the first time that the Obama-Biden administration made a big mistake in deporting millions of immigrants, but you didn't publicly speak out against it at the time. What commitment will you make tonight that as president you won't deport millions again?  BIDEN: Number one, I said that it took much too long to get it right. And the president did get it right by DACA as well as making sure that he tried to protect parents as well, and, by the way, moving on an immigration bill as well. The fact is that we already had a vote on an immigration bill, by the way, and Bernie voted against it, the immigration bill. Had he voted for it and it had passed, we would already have 6 million undocumented would be citizens as I speak right now.  But I will send to the desk immediately a bill that requires the access to citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks, number one. Number two, in the first 100 days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all. From that point on, the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the United States of America.  CALDERON: So to be clear, only felons get deported and everyone else gets to stay?  BIDEN: Period, yes. Yes, and the reason is...  CALDERON: Senator Sanders?  BIDEN: ... it's about uniting families, it's about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation that is decent.  SANDERS: Let me respond and I'll answer your question, respond to what Joe's comments about the 2007 immigration bill. That bill was opposed by LULAC, the largest Latino organization in America. The Southern Poverty Law Center called its guest worker programs akin to slavery.  There wasn't really a vote on the bill. It was killed because there was a vote on the Doggett Amendment, I think it was 49-48, and you know who voted with me on that one, Joe? Barack Obama. He understood that that proposal was a bad idea. We don't need slavery in America where workers -- guest workers are forced to stay with their employers.  But in terms of immigration in general, let me outline some of the things that we do. Day one, we restore the legal status of 1.8 million young people and their parents in the DACA program. Number two, immediately, we end these ICE raids which are terrorizing communities all over this country. Three, we change the border policy. Under my administration, no federal agent will ever grab little babies from the arms of their mothers. And, fourth, I think we can pass what the American people want and that is comprehensive immigration reform, a path towards citizenship for the 11 million undocumented.  CALDERON: Senator Sanders, critics suggest positions like this send a message that when a Democrat is in the White House, the border is open. Do they?  SANDERS: No, that's just -- I mean, that's what Trump says. And that is a total lie. What we're talking about is a humane, sensible policy supported by the American people. Nobody is talking about open borders. And, of course, Trump lies a about that.  But the bottom line is right now you have in this country people who have been here for decades.  [21:15:00]  They are working hard. They are raising their kids. They are an important part of our agricultural economy, our construction economy. These are good people. And yet they are living in terror. And we have got to end that terror and end the ICE raids and move toward a path towards citizenship.  BIDEN: Let me set the record straight on something that was said. You know, the idea that it was slavery, Barack Obama supported that bill -- that immigration bill. Teddy Kennedy supported that immigration bill. I supported it. I doubt whether those people think it's slavery.  SANDERS: Well...  BIDEN: And by the way, right after his vote against that, he went on the Lou Dobbs show and continued the canard that they're taking jobs, these immigrants are taking jobs from Americans, which is one of the Republican canards, right after that vote -- that no vote.  And so, come on, this is -- you think Ted Kennedy is for slavery? Think I was for slavery? You think...  (CROSSTALK)  BIDEN: ... voted for it for slavery? And with regard to your issue -- your question relative to whether or not I would deal with supporting the border. Look, we can deal with securing the border by national technical means. All the bad things are coming through ports of entry right now. We don't need a wall.  And by the way, I would immediately as president surge to the border. I would end this notion for the first time in history that people seeking asylum have to be in squalor on the other side of the river, and in just desperate situation. They should be able to come to the United States and have a judgment made as to whether or not they qualify.  I would also surge to the border immigration judges to make decisions immediately. And no one, no one would be put in jail while waiting for their hearing.  CALDERON: Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: Well, it's kind of what I have been saying throughout the entire campaign.  BIDEN: So have I.  SANDERS: What we need is, at the border, hundreds of administrative judges. We need to deal with people who are seeking asylum based on international law. We need not to be dividing children from their parents and dividing families up. We need a humane border policy.  And I'll tell you what else we need. And I speak as the son of an immigrant. My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, couldn't speak English, didn't have much of an education. I will end on day one the demonization, the ugly demonization from the White House of the immigrant community in this country. We have got a president who is trying to divide us up. My administration brings our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian-American.  CALDERON: Thank you, Senator Sanders.  Vice President Biden, you opposed sanctuary cities as a presidential candidate in 2007. Where do you stand now? Should undocumented immigrants, arrested by local police, be turned over to immigration officials?  BIDEN: No.  CALDERON: Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: Of course not. Look, and one of the things that goes on when you have that process is that not only the psychological terror, and I have talked to these kids, kids are scared to death in America when they come from school that their mom or dad may not be there, maybe deported.  What we need to do is to end, and I will end this on day one, the ICE raids that have been so harmful to so many people. And we need to do again what the American people want us to do. I'm the son of an immigrant. This is a country significantly built by immigrant labor, built by slave labor. And what we have got to do is appreciate each other and end this demonization and divisiveness coming from the Trump administration.  TAPPER: Senator Sanders...  (CROSSTALK)  TAPPER: Go ahead.  BIDEN: Look, we are a nation of immigrants. Our future rests upon the Latino community being fully integrated. Twenty-four out of every 100 children in school today from kindergarten through high school is a Latino. Right now, today. The idea that any American thinks it doesn't pay for us to significantly invest in their future is absolutely a bizarre notion, because if we do not invest, everything that the very wealthy are concerned about and the xenophobes are concerned about will, in fact, get worse, not better.  We should be embracing, bringing them in, just like what happened with the Irish immigrants after the famine, just what happened with the Italians, et cetera. We have been through this before. Xenophobia is a disease.  TAPPER: Thank you, Vice President Biden.  Let's move now to the climate crisis. I'm coming right to you, Senator Sanders. The World Health Organization calls the climate crisis a \"health crisis\" and warns that climate change could fuel the spread of infectious diseases. Can you point to specific measures in your climate plan that address that threat?  SANDERS: Well, of course we do. I mean, we -- look,  [21:20:00]  this is what the scientists are telling us, the same scientists who make your point there, Jake. What they are telling us is if we don't get our act together in the next seven or eight years, there would be irreversible damage done to this planet. We're talking about cities in America from Miami to New Orleans to Charleston, South Carolina, being under water.  We are talking about severe droughts, which will prevent farmers in the Midwest from growing the food that we need. We're talking about extreme weather disturbances, which hit Houston, Texas, Venice, Italy, just a few months ago. We are talking about the absolute need, and I want to hear Joe's position on this, this is not a middle of the ground thing. This is not building a few more solar panels or a few more wind turbines.  What this is about is transforming our energy system as quickly as we humanly can away from fossil fuel. It is insane that we continue to have fracking in America. It is absurd that we give tens of billions of dollars a year in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. This has got to end and end now if we love our kids and future generations. TAPPER: Vice President Biden?  BIDEN: First thing that President Obama and I were summoned to the State Department -- excuse me, the Defense Department for was to meet with all the chiefs. The single greatest threat to our national security, they said, is climate change, the single greatest threat to our national security. Because as populations have to move because they can no longer live where they are, because their islands are sinking, because you saw what happened in Darfur with the change in weather patterns and the desert there. It causes war. It causes great migrations, great migrations. They said that's the single biggest problem.  Number two, there's an awful lot of people today who are, in fact, getting ill because of the changes in the environment, particularly up where Bernie lives, I'm not -- it has nothing to do with him, but having -- up in the Northeast because you have everything from beetle infestation and a whole range of things that are causing diseases as well in addition to eliminating foliage.  TAPPER: So, Vice President Biden, let me ask you then that the -- you talk about this being the number one crisis, they told you at the Pentagon.  BIDEN: Yes.  TAPPER: The price tag for your climate plan is about $1.7 trillion. That's about $14 trillion less than Senator Sanders wants to spend on this. Is your plan ambitious enough to tackle this crisis?  BIDEN: Yes, it is ambitious enough to tackle the crisis because what -- you go to joebiden.com, I lay out the first 13 things I would do immediately upon being elected.  Number one, we're going to once again reinstate all the cuts the president made in everything from the CAFE standards, how far automobiles can go, investing in light rail so that we take cars off the road, making sure we're in a position where we are now in a position that we put 500,000 charging stations in areas that, in fact, all new highways that we built.  Making sure that we spend $500 billion a year in the federal government paying for transportation, the vehicles we run. All of those being converted to be able to run on low carbon fuel and/or be able to run on no carbon fuel at all by having them move into a direction that is all, all carbon-free.  We can do these things. We can lay down the tracks where nothing can be changed by the next president or following president, the one beyond that.  In addition to that, we also have to -- I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, which I helped put together. I would call the 100 nations -- over 100 nations, but the 100 major polluters to the United States in the first 100 days to up the ante and make it clear that, in fact, we would -- in fact, if they didn't, there would be a price to pay.  And lastly, I would be right now organizing the hemisphere and the world to provide $20 billion for the Amazon, for Brazil no longer to burn the Amazon so they could have forests -- they're no longer forests, but they could have farming, and say, this is what we're going to do. They absorb more carbon in the Amazon, and the region is burning now, than we emit in one entire year per year.  TAPPER: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: All well and good, but nowhere near enough. I mean, you mentioned we started this debate talking about a war-like situation in terms of the coronavirus. And we said we have to act accordingly. You said it. I think you're right. I said it. We have to act dramatically, boldly, if we're going to save lives in this country and around the world.  I look at climate change in exactly the same way. It's not a question of re-entering the Paris Accord. That's fine. Who cares. Not a big deal. The deal right now is do we have the courage? And this gets back to the point I'm trying to make all night long.  [21:25:00]  Do we take on the health care industry and tell them their profits are not more important than health care for all? Do we take on the fossil fuel industry?  Look, in terms of the fossil fuel industry, these guys have been lying. They've been lying for years like the tobacco industry lied 50 years ago. \"Oh, we don't know if -- if fossil fuels, if oil and carbon emissions are causing climate change.\"  They knew. Exxon Mobil knew. They lied. In fact, I think they should be held criminally accountable.  But this, Jake, is an issue of enormous consequence. What Joe was saying goes nowhere near enough. It's not a question of money.  Give me a minute here. Let's -- we have time to talk about this. This is a world-changing event.  TAPPER: I understand. I just want to give him a chance to respond and then we can come back to you.  SANDERS: OK. All right. Let's stay on it.  TAPPER: We're staying on this issue.  BIDEN: Number one, no more subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one. Number two, we're in a situation, as well, where we cannot -- we -- we  are able to move rapidly to change the dynamic in terms of what we can do to set in motion -- the fact that he says climate change, Paris Accord doesn't mean much -- we can get everything exactly right. We're 15 percent of the problem. Eight-five percent of the problem is over there. We need someone who can deal internationally. We need someone who can bring the world together again. We need someone who can move in a direction that, in fact, if you violate the commitment you make, you will pay an economic price for it, like what's happening in China. They're exporting coal, significant coal.  TAPPER: Thank you.  SANDERS: OK, look, obviously, the Paris Accord is -- is useful. But it doesn't go anywhere -- if you're laughing, Joe, then you're missing the point. This is an existential crisis.  BIDEN: Bingo.  SANDERS: You -- you -- you talk about -- you know, I'm talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can. I'm talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet -- no ifs, buts and maybes about it. I'm talking about speaking to...  BIDEN: So am I.  SANDERS: Well, I'm not sure your proposal does that.  I'm talking about speaking to China, to Russia, to countries all over the world -- and in this moment, making the point that instead of spending $1.8 trillion on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.  I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic, bold action. We've got to take on the fossil fuel industry. Your plan does not do that.  BIDEN: My plan takes on the fossil fuel industry and it unites the world. You just got finished saying -- what's he going to do? He's going to bring these countries together, make it clear to them. I'm saying we bring them together, make them live up to their commitments. If they don't live up to their commitments, they pay a financial price for it. They pay an economic price for it.  Because we can do everything -- my -- my state is three feet above sea level. I don't need a lecture on what's going to happen about rising seas. I know what happens. I watch the whole DelMarVa peninsula, just like it is in South Carolina and the rest, something I know a little bit about.  I wrote the first climate change bill that was in the Congress, which Politifact said was a game-changer. I'm the guy who came along and said, with Dick Lugar, that we're going to trade -- we'll forgive your debt if you don't cut down your forest. I have been way ahead of this curve. This idea that, all of a sudden, Bernie found this out is amazing to me.  TAPPER: Senator Sanders?  SANDERS: No, Bernie didn't find it out. Bernie is listening to the scientists. And what, you know, you're talking about making countries around the world fulfill their commitments, those commitments are not enough.  What this moment is about, Joe, is that the scientists are telling us they underestimated the severity of the crisis. They were wrong. The problem is more severe.  So all that I'm saying right here is that we have -- we are fighting for the future of this planet, for the well-being of our kids and future generations. You cannot continue, as I understand, Joe believes, to continue fracking. Correct me if I am wrong. What we need to do right now is bring the world together, tell the fossil fuel industry that we are going to move aggressively to win solar, sustainable energies...  TAPPER: Thank you.  SANDERS: ... and energy efficiency.  BIDEN: Thank you, Senator.  BIDEN: No more -- no new fracking. And by the way, on the Recovery Act, I was able to make sure we invested $90 billion in making sure we brought down the price of solar and wind, that is lower than the price of coal. That's why not another new coal plant will be built. I did that, while you were watching, number one.  Number two, we're in a situation where we, in fact, have the ability to lay down the tracks where no one can change the -- change the dynamic. And that's why we should be talking about things like I have been talking about for years, high-speed rail, taking millions of automobiles off the road,  [20:30:00]  making sure that we move in a direction where no more -- no more drilling on federal lands, making sure that we invest in changing the entire fleet...  TAPPER: Thank you.  BIDEN: ... of the United States military to -- anyhow.  TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  Senator Sanders, I want -- I want to talk to you about fracking. Because you want to ban fracking...  SANDERS: Yes.  TAPPER: ... which is a method of extracting natural gas. The shift towards natural gas and away from coal has resulted in reduced U.S. carbon emissions. So how can the U.S. transition to your targeted goal of zero emissions with fracking completely out of the picture?  SANDERS: Because we have to invest in an unprecedented way -- in an unprecedented way. You started off by saying that we're talking about a $13 trillion, $14 trillion investment. That is a lot of money. And I've been criticized for that. But I don't know what the alternative is, if we are playing for the future of this planet. So we've got to be dramatic. And what being dramatic is, massive investments in wind, in solar, under the -- in sustainable energies in general, in research and development, in making our buildings all over this country.  My state of Vermont and around this country have got a lot of old buildings. We can put millions and millions of people to work making our buildings energy-efficient, moving our transportation system to electricity.  So what we're talking about is a massive unprecedented investment. That is what the Green New Deal is about. I supported it. And I will fight to implement it.  TAPPER: Thank you so much, Senator Sanders.  We're going to be back with more from the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  [21:35:00]  TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate. On Tuesday voters in Arizona, Ohio, Illinois and Florida will cast their votes in the Democratic primary.  Here's Univision's Ilia Calderon.  CALDERON: Thank you, Jake.  Let's move now to foreign policy. Senator Sanders, there are about 1.5 million Cuban-Americans living in Florida right now. Why would they vote for you when they hear you praise a program of Fidel Castro, a dictator who jailed, tortured and killed thousands of Cubans?  SANDERS: I have opposed authoritarianism, whether it's in Cuba, whether it's in Saudi Arabia, whether it's in China or whether it is in Russia. That is my life record. I believe, unlike the president of the United States, in democracy, not authoritarianism, in Cuba or any place else.  What I believe right now, in this world, is that we are faced with a global crisis and a movement toward authoritarianism. That's what Putin in Russia is leading. That's what MBS in Saudi Arabia is leading.  And as president of the United States, unlike Donald Trump, I would put the flag down and say that, in this country and in this world, we have got to move toward democracy and human rights. That is my view and has always been my view.  CALDERON: To be clear, Senator Sanders, Cuba has been a dictatorship for decades. Shouldn't we judge dictators by the violation of human rights and not by any of their alleged achievements?  SANDERS: Well, I think you can make the same point about China. China is undoubtedly an authoritarian society, OK. But would anybody deny, any economist deny that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was 40 or 50 years ago? That's a fact. So I think we condemn authoritarianism, whether it's in China, Russia, Cuba, any place else. But to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would, I think, be incorrect.  BIDEN: Vice President Biden, you have criticized Senator Sanders for praising Castro's education system. But in 2016 President Obama said Cuba made, quote, \"a great progress in educating young people\" and that its health care system \"is a huge achievement that they should be congratulated for.\"  How is that different from what Senator Sanders has said?  BIDEN: He was trying to change Cuban policy so the Cuban people would get out from under the thumb of Castro and his brother, that is to change the policy so that we could in fact on -- impact on Cuba's policy by getting them opened up. That's what that was about.  But the praising of the Sandinistas, the praising of Cuba, the praising, just now, of China -- China is an authoritarian dictatorship. That's what it is. We have to deal with them because they're there. But the idea that they, in fact, have increased the wealth of people in that country -- it's been marginal, the change that's taken place. It is still -- they have a million Uighurs, a million Muslims in prison camps in the West. You see what's happening in Hong Kong today.  And by the way, the idea that he praised the Soviet Union, when it was the Soviet Union, about the things that they had done well -- they're an awful dictatorship killing millions and millions of people.  And in addition to that, we have a circumstance where, after the election was all over and we knew what -- what was done by -- by the Russians now, in interfering with our elections, this man voted against sanctioning Russia for interference in our elections.  [21:40:05]  BASH: Senator Sanders...  BIDEN: I don't get it.  SANDERS: Well, what you don't get -- and this is exactly what the problem with politics is about. All right, question. Did China make progress in ending extreme poverty over the last 50 years, yes or no?  BIDEN: That's like saying Jack the Ripper... SANDERS: No, it's not.  BIDEN: Yes, it is.  SANDERS: See, Joe, this is the problem.  BIDEN: Yes, it is.  SANDERS: This is the problem. We can't talk -- I know there's a political line. I understand. China's terrible and awful, nothing ever good, (inaudible). But the fact of the matter is China, of course, is an authoritarian society. It's what I just said.  BIDEN: It's a dictatorship.  SANDERS: That's what I just said five minutes ago, you know. And, by the way, you know, the question that was asked quoted Barack Obama. President Obama was more generous in his praise of what Cuba did in health care and education than I was. I was talking about a program 60 years ago, in the first year of the Castro revolution.  So the bottom line is that I think it's a little bit absurd -- if we're going to look at the world the way it is, of course, we are opposed to authoritarianism. And by the way, you know, before it was considered good policy, a good idea. I was condemning the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia when a lot of other people in Washington...  BIDEN: It wasn't me.  SANDERS: I was condemning the dictatorship in the UAE. You were not.  BIDEN: Yes, I was.  CALDERON: Thank you, Senator Sanders.  Vice President Biden?  BIDEN: Look, the idea of occasionally saying something nice about a country is one thing. The idea of praising a country that is violating human rights around the world is, in fact -- makes our allies wonder what's going on.  What do you think the South Koreans think when we -- or he praises China like that?  What do you think -- what do you think the Australians believe in the shadow of China?  What do you think is happening in Indonesia in the shadow of China?  What do you think is happening in terms of Japan in the shadow of China?  Words matter. These are flat-out dictators, period. And they should be called for it, straight up. We may have to work out -- for example, I was able to help negotiate a New START agreement with Russia, not because I like Putin. The guy's a thug.  TAPPER: Mr. Vice President, sticking with foreign policy, you acknowledge that your support and vote for the Iraq War was a mistake. What lessons did you learn from that mistake?  And how might those lessons influence your foreign policy decision- making as president?  BIDEN: I learned I can't take the word of a president when, in fact, they assured me that they would not use force. Remember the context. The context was the United Nations Security Council was going to vote to insist that we allow inspectors in to determine whether or not -- whether or not they were in fact producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction.  They were not. And what's the first thing that happened when we got elected?  President Obama turned to me and said, \"Get those troops out of there.\"  I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq. I was -- I admitted 14 years ago it was a mistake to have trusted him. And I'm prepared to compare my foreign policy credentials up against my friend here on any day of the week and every day of the week.  BIDEN: Well, let's start off with the war in Iraq, Joe. I was there, too. I was in the House. I understood -- and, by the way, let's be clear about what that vote was. And you were there at the signing ceremony with Bush. Everybody in the world knew that, when you voted for that resolution, you were giving Bush the authority to go to war. And everybody knew that's exactly what he and Cheney wanted to do.  Most people who followed that issue closely understood that the Bush administration was lying through",

Here's how it'll affect you in other ways\nBy Chris Isidore, Vanessa Yurkevich and Matt Egan, CNN Business\n\nUpdated: Sat, 26 Nov 2022 16:35:02 GMT\n\nSource: CNN Business\n\nSo once again the nation and its economy is facing the risk of a massive freight railroad strike, this one as soon as Dec. 9. But about the only thing you don't need to worry about it is whether it will affect your holiday shopping plans. (It won't.)\n\nA prolonged rail strike could create all types of shortages, from gasoline to food to automobiles, and cause a spike in the prices of all types of consumer goods. It can screw up the commutes of tens of thousands of workers who take the train to work, slow the delivery of parts and force factories to shut down. But one area that most likely won't see immediate or severe disruptions will be Christmas.\n\n\"The stuff that needs to move for the holidays has already moved by rail,\" said Balaji Guntur, vice president in global consultancy Kearney's transportation practice and a logistics veteran. The goods that retailers are counting on for the holidays are already in stores or nearby warehouses.\n\n\"Christmas is not canceled,\" Brian Dodge, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, told CNN in a phone interview earlier this week. His group includes Walmart, Target, Home Depot and dozens of other major brands.\n\nA previous strike threat in September risked causing greater problems with goods slated for holiday sales, but that strike threat was averted by an 11th-hour tentative labor deal. But that strike threat is back, worrying shippers, after rank-and-file members of four rail unions rejected the earlier tentative deals. Negotiators for the two sides are back at the table.\n\nWhile the railroads say they are hopeful of reaching new deals, they have so far rejected the demands that union negotiators say their members want.\n\nA strike would \"would utterly upend the supply chain,\" Dodge said, adding that concern among retail CEOs is \"high\" because of the increasing risk of a national rail strike. About 30% of the nation's freight, when measured by weight and distance traveled, moves by rail, and there just isn't enough capacity on trucks or other modes to move those goods if the railroads grind to a halt.\n\nAnd a freight rail strike could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone, according to a new analysis from the Anderson Economic Group. \"Calculations show a first-day impact of approximately $60 million, including $30.9 million for lost freight, $3.8 million for long-term passenger rail disruption and $25 million in lost railroad industry wages,\" the analysis revealed.\n\nSecond and third day strike losses would increase to $91 billion per day because of lost agricultural goods and food spoilage. The costs would escalate from there.\n\nMany people expect Congress to intervene, either to order rail workers to stay on the job or quickly return to work if there is a strike, because of such severe economic ramifications.\n\nThe unions oppose Congressional intervention, saying the risk of a strike is the only way to get the railroads, many of which reported record or near record profits last year and will do so again this year, to make meet workers' demands for better working conditions, including sick pay policies common for most workers in other industries.\n\nBut if a strike starts, and stretches on, here's how it could affect other sectors, and many Americans:\n\nGasoline\n\nRefineries get most of their crude oil via pipelines and ship most of the products they produce, such as gas, diesel and jet fuel, via pipelines. Still, railroad tank cars are a key part of that process.\n\nJust about all ethanol that goes into gasoline moves by rail; gasoline wouldn't be compliant with some environmental regulations without it. But even if those regulations could be waived, the cost of a gallon of gas without ethanol would jump by about 16 cents due to the loss of tax breaks, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n\nPipelines carry most of the nation's crude oil to refineries, but each day about 300,000 barrels move by rail, a volume that would supply about two mid-size refineries, according to data from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refineries' trade group. Numerous chemicals used in the refining process also are transported via rail, as do some lower-grade products and waste materials.\n\n\"If rail cars aren't coming in regularly to pick up facility products, including the sulfur that refiners remove from crude oil, production will have to curtail,\" the refineries' trade group said earlier this fall.\n\nFood\n\nFood prices might not be as negatively affected by an early December strike date,as they would have been in September amid the fall harvest. But grain and other food products still need to move by rail.\n\nThat, coupled with low water levels on the Mississippi that have slowed barge traffic amid a Midwest drought, has the nation's agricultural industry very worried about possible strike.\n\n\"Any additional disruption of rail service would immediately impact the nation's food and agriculture and broader supply chains,\" said Mike Seyfert, CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association. \"The risk in both domestic and international markets is real.\"\n\nCars\n\nDecember is a major month for auto sales. But car and truck production is currently hampered by a shortage of numerous essential parts, most notably computer chips that in turn has created a dearth of vehicles available for sale on dealer lots. That's why car prices are now at record highs.\n\nBut that's nothing compared to what would happen with a prolonged rail strike. About 75% of completed cars built in US factories or imported here move by rail. So do many of the parts used to build vehicles, moving between suppliers and car assembly plants, and production will quickly halt if those rail links are severed. It would take time to make up for lost output, creating upward pressure on car prices.\n\nManufacturing\n\nMost factories aim to have parts and raw materials delivered right before they're used in assembly lines \u2014 a process known as \"just-in-time\" delivery. Many factories depend on rail to receive those parts and supplies and then ship out them out for delivery.\n\n\"We already face economic turmoil with rising costs, product shortages and high inflation. Any nationwide rail strike or shutdown will cause even more economic pain,\" said a statement from the National Association of Manufacturers earlier this month, adding that it's crucial that a strike be avoided.\n\nA lengthy rail strike could result in temporary plant closures, which is what happened across the global auto industry in recent years due to the shortage of parts and computer chips.\n\nCommuting\n\nOnly the nation's freight rail lines face a pending strike, but commuters would likely be affected, too. Many commuter trains travel on tracks maintained and operated by the freight railroads and passenger railroads expect they'll have to shut down their operations once the freight strike starts.\n\nAmtrak cut service on most of its long distance trains in the days leading up to the earlier Sept. 16 strike deadline deadline. The company owns roughly 700 miles of track, mostly between Boston and Washington, DC, but about 97% of its 22,000 mile nationwide system runs on freight lines.\n\nMany commuter railroads also move over freight rail lines and could not operate if a strike was called. That could mean more commuters driving to work, and more traffic and congestion even for those who don't normally take a train.\n\n\u00a9 2022 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company.

Trade group Mobile UK said it had been notified of incidents in England, Wales and Scotland. One of the targeted sites provides mobile connectivity to a hospital in Birmingham. The figure represents a lower incidence rate than had been the case the previous weekend. Mobile UK added it had received no reports of staff being targeted over the period. Attacks on 5G masts pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. But there are concerns a surge in the amount of vandalism has been caused by conspiracy theories, which falsely claim the deployment of 5G networks has caused or helped accelerate the spread of Covid-19. \"Theories being spread about 5G are baseless and are not grounded in credible scientific theory,\" said a spokesman for Mobile UK. \"Mobile operators are dedicated to keeping the UK connected, and careless talk could cause untold damage. \"Continuing attacks on mobile infrastructure risk lives and, at this challenging time, the UK's critical sectors must be able to focus all their efforts on fighting this pandemic.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Vodafone said one of the masts attacked was used by patients and staff at a hospital in Birmingham The chief executive of Vodafone UK added that one of the targeted sites serves Birmingham's Nightingale hospital. \"It's heart-rending enough that families cannot be there at the bedside of loved ones who are critically ill,\" wrote Nick Jeffrey on LinkedIn \"It's even more upsetting that even the small solace of a phone or video call may now be denied them because of the selfish actions of a few deluded conspiracy theorists. \"Imagine if it were your mum or dad, your gran or grandad in hospital. Imagine not being able to see or hear them one last time. All because you've swallowed a dangerous lie.\" The minister for digital infrastructure had earlier described such attacks as being \"irresponsible and idiotic\". Mobile UK's announcement came hours after media regulator Ofcom said it was assessing comments made by ITV presenter Eamonn Holmes about 5G technology and coronavirus. On Monday, he had cast doubt on media reports which had explicitly refuted the myth that the two are linked. But this morning, he clarified his position saying: \"There is no connection between the present national health emergency and 5G, and to suggest otherwise would be wrong and indeed it could be dangerous.\" Fresh attacks There have also been reports of potential cases since the Easter break. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of arson after a phone mast was on fire in Dagenham, Essex. The Met police told the Barking and Dagenham Post : \"Some evacuations were carried out as a precaution, but residents have since been allowed to return to their homes. There are no reports of any injuries.\" Police in Huddersfield have also said they are trying to determine exactly how a phone mast came to be on fire in the early hours of this morning. The fire destroyed communications equipment used by the emergency services as well as three mobile phone network providers, the local fire service said. Recent attacks on telecoms infrastructure have not been limited to the UK. On Saturday, the newspaper De Telegraaf reported there had been four incidents in the Netherlands over the previous week. It said in one case, arsonists had left an anti-5G slogan painted on the damaged equipment. There have also been reports of a suspected case in Ireland , where two masts caught fire on Sunday. Network provider Eir said the affected infrastructure was not being used for 5G, but was being upgraded to boost 4G coverage for a nearby hospital and the surrounding area. Unfounded theories Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Image copyright Reuters Image caption There have dozens of reported attacks on telecoms equipment over the past weeks One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still \"non-ionising\", meaning it lacks enough energy to break apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea and well outside mainstream scientific thought . In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacteria. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.",

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors. In times of crisis, conspiracy theories can spread as fast as a virus. As the coronavirus pandemic tightened its grip on a world which struggled to comprehend the enormity of the situation it was facing, darker forces were concocting their own narratives. Scientists and researchers were working \u2013 and continue to work \u2013 around the clock for answers. But science is slow and methodical. So far-fetched explanations about how the outbreak started began filling the vacuum. Among these strange explanations is a theory that the recent rollout of 5G technology is to blame. But where did this theory begin, how did it develop and mutate and what can be done to stem the tide of fake news? We asked four experts who have all done extensive research in this area to examine these questions. Marc Tuters, assistant professor of new media and digital culture at the University of Amsterdam, and Peter Knight, professor of American studies at the University of Manchester, examine the big questions and the history of conspiracy theories. Then Wasim Ahmed, lecturer in digital business at Newcastle University, and Joesph Downing, a nationalism research fellow at the London School of Economics, share the results of their new study into the origins of the 5G conspiracy theory on social media. A toxic cocktail of misinformation Marc Tuters and Peter Knight Conspiracy theories about mobile phone technology have been circulating since the 1990s, and have long historical roots. Doctors first talked of \u201cradiophobia\u201d as early as 1903. Following on from fears about power lines and microwaves in the 1970s, opponents of 2G technology in the 1990s suggested that radiation from mobile phones could cause cancer, and that this information was being covered up. Other conspiracy theories about 5G include the idea that it was responsible for the unexplained deaths of birds and trees. The coronavirus 5G conspiracy theory comes in several different strains, of varying degrees of implausibility. One of the first versions of the theory claimed that it was no coincidence that 5G technology was trialled in Wuhan, where the pandemic began (this is incorrect, as 5G was already being rolled out in number of locations). Some claim that the coronavirus crisis was deliberately created in order to keep people at home while 5G engineers install the technology everywhere. Others insist that 5G radiation weakens people\u2019s immune systems, making them more vulnerable to infection by COVID-19. Another mutation of the 5G conspiracy theory asserts that 5G directly transmits the virus. These different 5G stories are often combined together with other COVID-19 conspiracy theories into a toxic cocktail of misinformation. At first, some conspiracy theorists insisted that the threat of the virus (and the apparent death rates) had been exaggerated. Echoing President Donald Trump\u2019s own language, some of his supporters considered this as part of an elaborate \u201choax\u201d intended to harm his chances of re-election. Others, particularly on the far right in the US, framed lockdown emergency measures in terms of \u201cDeep State\u201d efforts at controlling the population and called for a \u201csecond civil war\u201d in response. Other prominent theories include the claim that the virus was accidentally released by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or that it was deliberately made as a biowarfare weapon, either by the Chinese or the Americans. One increasingly popular idea is that the pandemic is part of a plan by global elites like Bill Gates or George Soros \u2013 in league with Big Pharma \u2013 to institute mandatory worldwide vaccinations that would include tracking chips, which would then be activated by 5G radiowaves. Polling data in various countries including the UK, the US, France, Austria and Germany has shown that the most popular coronavirus conspiracy theory is that the virus was man-made \u2013 62% of respondents in the UK think that this theory is true to some degree. In that UK poll, 21% agreed, to varying extents, that coronavirus is caused by 5G and is a form of radiation poisoning transmitted through radiowaves. In comparison, 19% agreed that Jews have created the virus to collapse the economy for financial gain. Where did these theories come from? Few of these theories are new. Most of them are mutations or re-combinations of existing themes, often drawing on narrative tropes and rhetorical manoeuvres that have a long history. Conspiracy theorists usually have a complete worldview, through which they interpret new information and events, to fit their existing theory. Indeed, one of the defining characteristics of conspiracy thinking is that it is self-sealing, unfalsifiable and resistant to challenge. The absence of evidence is, ironically, often taken as evidence of a massive cover up. The dismissal of the pandemic as a hoax and the questioning of scientific experts is straight out of the playbook of climate change denial. The 5G theory about radiowaves transmitting or activating the virus, for example, is a reworking of long running conspiracy fears about mind control experiments, subliminal messaging and supposed secret US military weapons projects (all ripe topics for Hollywood\u2019s movie industry). The 5G story shares similarities with rumours that date back to the 1990s about HAARP (the US military\u2019s High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program). HAARP was a large radio transmitter array located in Alaska and funded by the US Department of Defence, in conjunction with a number of research universities. The programme conducted experiments into the ionosphere (the upper layer of the atmosphere) using radio waves, and was closed down in 2014. Conspiracy theorists, however, claimed that it was actually developing a weapon for weather control as well as mind control. Similarly, concerns have been expressed concerning that 5G might be in fact be a hi-tech weapon whose use represents an \u201cexistential threat to humanity\u201d. There have also long been conspiracy rumours that Big Pharma is suppressing a cure for cancer. The idea that the virus was made in a lab mirrors claims made a quarter of a century ago about HIV/AIDS. One origin for that story was an early example of a KGB disinformation campaign. The allegation that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or George Soros planned the coronavirus pandemic is a version of familiar right-wing (and often racist and antisemitic) conspiracy fantasies about \u201cglobalist\u201d elites threatening national and individual sovereignty. There is mounting evidence that far-right groups are opportunistically using fear and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic to promote their hateful politics. Populist conspiracy theories often work by dividing the world into Us vs Them, with the aim of scapegoating people and institutions and providing simple explanations for complex phenomena. The 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories are particularly challenging because they bring together people from very different parts of the political spectrum. On the one hand, they attract the far-right who see them as part of a technological assault by big government on the freedom of individuals. On the other, they appeal to the well established anti-vaxxer community, who are often allied with those distrustful of Big Pharma. In the US, which is in an election year, coronavirus mitigation strategies have become a divisive culture war issue, with the president refusing to wear a face mask. But in countries like Germany anti-lockdown issues appear to be creating connections across the political spectrum, led by social media influencers who are working to connect the dots between previously separate conspiracy theory communities or tribes. A misbegotten, warped freedom obsession is killing us. pic.twitter.com/KbYaTVtR0O \u2014 Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) May 22, 2020 As seen in the quantitative analysis below, such influencers anchor conspiracy theory communities on social media. Because these methods provide only a partial view, it is problematic to assume that the members of these communities are necessarily trapped within echo chambers, unable to access other points of view. Nevertheless the findings do correspond with the troubling patterns outlined above. And they also show that those who believe in and propagate conspiracy theories can come from a cross section of society. Social network analysis Wasim Ahmed and Joseph Downing Our study set out to investigate the 5G conspiracy theory on Twitter towards the beginning of April 2020 which was when the conspiracy was trending in the UK and increasing its visibility. This time period coincided with reports that at least 20 UK 5G phone masts were vandalised, including damage reported at a hospital. There were also 5G arson attacks across continental Europe during this time. Our research set out to uncover who was spreading the conspiracy theory, the percentage of users who believed the theory and what steps were needed to combat it. We used a tool called NodeXL to carry out a social network analysis. NodeXL is a Microsoft Excel plugin which can be used to retrieve data from a number of social media platforms such as Twitter. We captured data using the \u201c5Gcoronavirus\u201d keyword which also retrieved tweets with the #5GCoronavirus hashtag. Tweets we analysed were posted from March 27 to April 4. The network consisted of a total of 10,140 tweets, which are composed of 1,938 mentions, 4,003 retweets, 759 mentions in retweets, 1,110 replies, and 2,328 individual tweets. We found that there was a specific Twitter account, set up as @5gcoronavirus19 with 383 followers, which was spreading the conspiracy theory and had become influential in driving it forward on social media. The account was able to send out 303 tweets in seven days. We also found that President Trump was often tagged in tweets and was influential within the network without having tweeted himself. This highlights the point about support for these theories coming from the alt-right. Out of a total of 2,328 individual tweets, 34.8% of users believed the theory and/or shared views in support of it. For example, one user who we are not identifying due to the ethics on which our study was based tweeted: 5G Kills! #5Gcoronavirus \u2013 they are linked! People don\u2019t be blind to the truth! But 32% denounced the theory or mocked it. For instance, one user noted: \u201c5G is not harming or killing a single person! COVID-19 #5Gcoronavirus\u201d. A further 33% were just general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Like one user who tweeted: \u201cI have a 10AM Skype Chat on Monday, COVID-19 #5Gcoronavirus\u201d. But this overt lack of support for the conspiracy itself became a problem because as more users joined the discussion, the profile of the topic was raised which allowed it to start trending. Network clusters  Author provided  We created a social network graph (above), clustering identified different shapes and structures within the network. The largest group in the network represented an \u201cisolates group\u201d. These groups are typically formed when a user mentions a hashtag in their tweets without mentioning another user. Big brands, sports events and breaking news stories will all have a sizeable isolates group. This suggests that during this time the conspiracy topic had become popular and attracted views and opinions from users who were new to the network. The second largest network shape resembled a \u201cbroadcast\u201d network and contained users that were being retweeted. Broadcast networks can typically be found in the Twitter feeds of celebrities and journalists. The Twitter handle @5gcoronavirus19, which was set up to spread the theory, formed a group of its own resembling a broadcast network shape and it received a number of retweets, showing how the conspiracy theory was being amplified as users retweeted content. Conspiracy theorists are likely to use comments made by influential figures which can add fuel to the fire. A key example of this would be when the television presenter Eamon Holmes said the media couldn\u2019t say for sure whether the 5G theory was false. These comments fell outside of the time period we studied. But they are likely to have had an impact across social media platforms. Holmes was strongly criticised by Ofcom which noted that his comments risked undermining the public\u2019s faith in science. The misinformation pandemic Months before mobile phone masks were attacked in the UK, the \u201cinfodemic\u201d (a wide and rapid spread of misinformation) was unfolding at a rapid pace. In France, news spread on Facebook of a tasty cure for the virus: Roquefort cheese. Indeed, a far more dangerous public health prospect than blue cheese, the rumour that cocaine could cure COVID-19 caused the French Ministry of Health to release a warning statement. #Coronavirus | D\u00e9sinfox \u274c Non, La coca\u00efne NE prot\u00e8ge PAS contre le #COVID19 . \u2705 C\u2019est une drogue addictive provoquant de graves effets ind\u00e9sirables et nocifs pour la sant\u00e9 des personnes. \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/ajSGwecauL pic.twitter.com/4GZ01Qmg5X \u2014 Minist\u00e8re des Solidarit\u00e9s et de la Sant\u00e9 (@MinSoliSante) March 8, 2020 Some argue that strange events like this, which erupt from the online world of fake news, memes and misinformation, effectively delivered Trump the US presidency. Given that a survey showed 75% of Americans believed fake news during that election, this claim is not as outrageous as it initially sounds. But there is another theory. Rather than social media activity leading to direct \u201creal world\u201d action, the reverse could be true. For example, a major event like the Arab Spring was a real world action that caused a ripple effect across social media. Dark forces are still at work on the internet during major events. They seek to spread a fake news agenda and change the way events are perceived and constructed in dangerous ways. Our other research, carried out with Richard Dron from the University of Salford, examined the depictions of Muslims during the Grenfell fire and tracked how Grenfell was covered on Twitter as the fire still burned in the early hours of June 14, 2017. In the following days both celebrities and politicians would be reprimanded for spreading distrust about official accounts of the fire. A strong denunciation of the 5G and COVID-19 conspiracy from a world leader, when it surfaced, would have helped in mitigating the effect of the theory on the public. But during this time Boris Johnson, the UK\u2019s prime minister, was himself sick with COVID-19. So was there was no direct rebuttal from him. Although this would have helped we believe the fight should ideally take place on the platform on which the conspiracy is shared. Our ongoing work on fitness influencers demonstrates how popular culture figures with large followings on Twitter and other social media platforms can sometimes have more of an appeal \u2013 and be more believable \u2013 than \u201cofficial\u201d accounts or politicians. That is why we believe that governments and health authorities should draw on social media influencers in order to counteract misinformation. It is also important to note which websites people were sharing around this time, as they are likely to play a key role in the spread and existence of the theory. Unsurprisingly, \u201cfake news\u201d websites such as InfoWars published a number of articles which indicated that there was a link between COVID-19 and 5G technologies. YouTube also appeared as an influential domain, as Twitter users linked to various videos which were spreading the theory. Worryingly, our study found that a small number of Twitter users were happy to see footage posted of 5G masts being damaged and hoped for more to be attacked. Twitter has been taking action and blocking users from sharing 5G conspiracy theories on the platform. YouTube has also been banning content that contains medical misinformation. It has not been easy for social media platforms to keep up as the pandemic has given rise over ten different conspiracy theories. One way the public can join the fight against conspiracy theories is to report inappropriate and/or dangerous content on social media platforms and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 avoid sharing or engaging with them. Meanwhile the mainstream media on public television, newspapers and radio should be doing its part by discussing and dispelling conspiracy theories as they arise. But social media platforms, citizens and governments need to work together with experts to regain trust and debunk the deluge of fake news and ever evolving theories. Mutations Marc Tuters and Peter Knight The viral conspiracy video, Plandemic is a key example as it has helped coronavirus conspiracy theories spread even more widely into the mainstream. The video \u2013 which briefly went viral on YouTube and Facebook until it was taken down \u2013 focused on a discredited virologist who promotes the theory that the coronavirus pandemic was a Big Pharma plot to sell vaccines. Although such conspiracy theories are less widespread than the torrent of coronavirus misinformation that is being catalogued and debunked by media watchdog groups, what is particularly concerning is how they are mutating and combining into novel and potentially dangerous forms as different tribes converge and encroach in the mainstream with slick videos involving \u201creal\u201d experts. With coronavirus, existing 5G conspiracy theories have indeed become supercharged, leading for instance to new protest movements such as the \u201chygiene protests\u201d in Germany. In these protests, unfamiliar configurations of left and right-wing activists are finding common cause in their shared indignance towards lockdown protocols. In the past several years Deep State conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon first developed within reactionary \u201cdeep web\u201d communities before spreading into the mainstream, where they were amplified by disinformation bots, social media influencers, celebrities, and politicians. Thriving communities have grown up around these theories, clustered around conspiracy theory entrepreneurs. A significant number of these figures, with some notable exceptions, have pivoted to interpret the coronavirus pandemic through their particular conspiratorial lens. With coronavirus as a common strand connecting these various tribes, the result has been a cross-fertilisation of ideas. Such hybridised conspiracy theories appear to be popping up across all points of the political spectrum and of the web, in contrast to previous cases when they emerged primarily from the margins and spread to the mainstream. In comparison with previous outbursts of fake news, social media platforms have responded quite proactively to the abundance of coronavirus-related problematic information. Google, for example, curates coronavirus-related search results, meaning that they only return authoritative sources and feature links to those sources where advertisements would usually have appeared. Platforms have also been much more willing to delete problematic trending content, as with the case of the Plandemic video which YouTube removed within 24 hours \u2013 although not before it had reached 2.5 million views. While this kind of banned content inevitably migrates to an \u201calternative social media ecology\u201d of sites like Bitchute and Telegram, their much smaller audience share diminishes the reach of these conspiracy theories as well as undermining the revenue streams of their entrepreneurs. In an era in which public distrust of institutions and suspicion of elites is one of the contributing factors in the global rise of national populism, the communication of authoritative knowledge is undoubtedly a challenge for governments. In this time of enormous uncertainty, capable and honest leadership is one of the only truly effective measures which will help manage the spread of coronavirus misinformation and politicians should be putting party allegiances to one side while confronting the problem. For everyone else this means accepting that short term solutions are unlikely and that people should trust the experts, think before sharing social media content and care for one another.

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors. As the coronavirus pandemic has gathered momentum, so too have explanations for how the outbreak started and what is causing its spread. Among these explanations is a theory that the recent rollout of 5G technology is to blame. Many countries are witnessing increased numbers of groups warning others about the dangers of 5G. In the UK, Australia and the US, activists believe that 5G is the real cause of the pandemic, and that disrupting the 5G network is necessary to halt the spread of the virus. At the extreme end of these groups are those who warn that COVID-19 is a hoax, a cover-story for more evil plans, of which 5G is a crucial part. Why do people believe conspiracy theories, and what accounts for the ongoing surge in their popularity? At the root of these beliefs is a contemporary spirit of distrust towards governments and health organisations. Moreover, people are particularly drawn to these alternative explanations during times of crisis. Truth seekers Many conspiracy theorists identify themselves as \u201ctruth seekers\u201d. They are often part of a wider movement of people that consider themselves to be free thinkers who are courageous enough to seek the truth, and to speak up. They act like heroic detectives, revealing what they see as powerful groups operating in secrecy to achieve malevolent outcomes. Most conspiracy theories view these powerful groups as working in the shadows, inaccessible and behind the scenes. But the 5G-coronavirus theory departs from this template in one crucial way: the source of evil is visible and accessible to anyone who believes in these ideas. Unlike shadowy cabals and occult forces, the 5G-coronavirus conspiracy can be challenged directly. The 5G network is composed of material infrastructures that are easy to identify and access. For those who believe they know the truth, acts of vandalism against phone masts and antennas represent the possibility to exert some control over troubling events. Conspiracies at a time of crisis People want to simplify and make sense of complex and unprecedented situations. As a means to understand this pandemic, there exist both official and conspiracy theories. The official truth is simple: COVID-19 was transferred to humans from animals, similar to previous coronavirus outbreaks. It is primarily spread through droplets generated when an infected person sneezes or coughs. The popularity of theories that link 5G to the outbreak, however, expose the levels of distrust towards scientific claims, truth and expert explanations of events. Although anti-5G theories have been around for some time, these explanations are currently winning new supporters. This is in part due to a lack of confidence in governments, many of which have struggled to manage this crisis, and now face questions as to whether they acted too early or too late. More concerning is how right-wing populism thrives in and intensifies this climate of distrust. All over the world, populist figures advance a polarising worldview that pits corrupt political, corporate and scientific elites against an enlightened community of \u201ccommon people\u201d. Donald Trump, Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro and Nigel Farage garner support by framing their struggle as one of the good leader against bad institutions. This worldview simultaneously undermines \u201cthe establishment\u201d, and legitimises conspiracy theorists\u2019 distrust. The implications of this are troubling. Distinctions between scientific truths and conspiracy theories have become blurred at the highest levels of government. Unproven solutions to control diseases are favoured over evidence-based interventions. Moreover, there is a growing resistance to vaccination in countries where political populism is on the rise. Policy interventions designed to solve problems are instead seen as part of the problem. An infodemic These considerations become even more important at a time when lockdown measures have led to people spending increased time on social media. In part, the internet enables those previously on the fringes of popular opinion to find and communicate with like-minded others. And while confidence in traditional institutions wanes, any number of alternative explanations resonate among friends in online groups. As people try to understand the pandemic and make sense of their changed lives, celebrity YouTube \u201ctruth seekers\u201d are receiving unprecedented levels of attention. Although Facebook newsfeeds are littered with state-sanctioned public health advice, private groups are awash with bogus claims and misinformation that contradicts the official knowledge and political processes. The World Health Organization has declared this situation to be an \u201cinfodemic\u201d. Pressure is now mounting on social media companies to restrict the flow of misinformation. Yet, within the truth seeker community, attempts by Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp to intervene are interpreted as further evidence that powerful institutions and elites are conspiring to conceal the \u201creal truth\u201d. Events such as the attacks on 5G masts offer a barometer to measure levels of trust in leadership and expertise. The challenge for governments and the media will be to demonstrate renewed levels of openness and solidarity to restore public trust, rather than fuelling this appetite for alternative truths.

He then goes on to claim while panning the camera up at an unidentified telecommunications tower: \u201cI\u2019m not a f\u2026ing conspiracy theorist, obviously I\u2019ve read all that stuff online about coronavirus and COVID-19, but why the f\u2026 are they putting circuitry like that in towers like that?\u201d The caption on the video reads: \u201cCovid-19 circuit boards being installed in 5G towers yeah ok\u201d with two laughing emojis. The May 14 Facebook video has been viewed over 160,000 times, been shared over 10,000 times and attracted over 950 likes. A still image from the video has appeared in a Facebook post here and the video appears on Instagram here A still from a video in which a man claims to be a 5G installer with a component labelled \u201cCOV.19\u201d. The Analysis The 5G network is the fifth generation of cellular mobile networks. The technology allows for faster data transfers, lower latency and will allow the connection of more devices to a mobile network at any one time. Telco companies including Telstra are currently rolling out 5G networks around capital cities in Australia, while a recent Parliamentary Report into the technology declared it will underpin a fourth industrial revolution in this country. During the COVID-19 crisis conspiracy theories seeking to connect the virus to the rollout of 5G technology have spread on social media networks. The theories have been debunked by experts and government agencies, but phone masts have still been attacked in the UK and other parts of Europe. The man in the May 14 video presents himself as an installer of 5G equipment at an unidentified location. The man, who wears a face mask, hardhat and hi-vis jacket, has a British accent and stands beside a blue van. Across a road, on the far side of a brick wall, is a telecommunications tower. The man claims he has been \u201cinstalling 5G masts on towers\u201d despite masts and towers being different support structures used in telecommuncations networks. During the one minute video the man waves around a piece of blue electronic circuit board that has on it a component labelled with a sticker that reads \u201cCOV.19\u201d. He says: \u201cthis is a piece of 5G kit and it says COV 19 on it\u201d. Through initial comments on the post and then by further research, AAP FactCheck identified the circuit board in the video as a component used in a Virgin Media (UK) pay-TV set top box. Virgin Media told AAP FactCheck in an email the component looks like a piece of hardware used in a set-top box, the Cisco 4585 HD (non-PVR) set top box, issued around nine years ago. \u201cThat is a board from a very old set top TV box and which never featured any component parts inscribed/stamped/printed or otherwise with COV 19. It has absolutely no relation with any mobile network infrastructure, including that used for 5G,\u201d a Virgin Media spokesperson said. There are other signs that the component featured in the video is not what it\u2019s claimed to be and is in fact from a set top box. At the 13-second mark the video shows the circuit board has a SCART connector \u2013 a 21 pin connector used to connect visual/audio equipment and an RF cable-in connector, a standard connector for a coaxial cable, as seen on the back of this Cisco set top box on the left of the image. At 59 seconds into the Facebook video, the marking \u201cHannstar J MV-1\u201d is clearly visible at the bottom of the piece of hardware. HannStar Display Corporation is a Taiwanese company that manufactures components for computer monitors, televisions and notebook displays. The last few frames of the video also show a what appears to be a disassembled black casing on the bonnet of the blue van. The casing resembles that of a set top box or similar device. A piece of circuit board seen in a Facebook video is not from a telecommunications tower.",

Major metro areas and technology hubs like Wuhan were selected to be official 5G Demonstration Zones. Only such a high concentration of 5G radio-frequency transmitters and microwave towers would permit a citywide build-out of the Internet of Things. 2019 was the year Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, was \u201cexpected to have 10,000 5G base stations by the end of 2019, said Song Qizhu, head of Hubei Provincial Communication Administration\u201d.[1] Then the coronavirus hit, so the whole world was told. What really happened was that a new variant of the coronavirus was released in Wuhan after the 5G experimenters saw an epidemic of 5G Syndrome explode. The 5G guinea pigs were literally dropping like flies as soon as they flipped the 5G switch. The ERs and urgent care clinics were overwhelmed. The 5G scientists watching the burgeoning public health crisis immediately activated Plan B: Blame it on a virulent flu\u2014a bioengineered coronavirus that produces symptoms similar to 5G Syndrome.\u201d \u2014 Intelligence Analyst and Former U.S. Army Officer The New World Order globalist cabal will not allow anything to impede the military deployment of 5G worldwide. That\u2019s it! ~~~ END OF STORY ~~~ 5G Syndrome Maps Perfectly with Coronavirus Outbreaks There\u2019s a LOT of hard evidence now emerging the further away we get from the original crime scene in Wuhan, China and as the coronavirus pops up around the world in 5G Hotspots that indicates this pandemic is being manufactured for multiple reasons. As it turns out, those nations with the most advanced 5G roll-outs have the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases, both infection rates and death rates. In those countries that have permitted IoT build-outs where the 5G power grids are the most developed, the coronavirus infection rate is taking off. What\u2019s really interesting is that Africa has thus far shown very few cases. As of this weekend there were only 3 medically acknowledged cases on the entire continent. Which begs the question: How do the Third World countries in Africa avoid such a contagious strain of the coronavirus given the pervasive lack of proper sanitation and necessary hygiene? In light of how deeply involved the Chinese are with development projects all over Africa, it\u2019s quite curious how that infection number is still so low. Perhaps it\u2019s directly related to the absence of 5G roll-outs in the vast majority of African nations. Before those nations suffering the greatest number of coronavirus infections to date are further investigated \u2014 China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, United States, France, Spain, Kuwait \u2014 another curious development ought to be looked at closely. The Proof is in the Cruise Ships The single best proof of the quite obvious 5G-Coronavirus linkage are the various cruise ships that have seen an inexplicable mushrooming of coronavirus cases, even after all the passengers were quarantined. Many of the biggest cruise lines now advertise the fact that they have the latest and greatest 5G technologies in place. The most advanced cruise ships actually possess the best examples of what the Internet of Things (IoT) will look like in the future \u2026 if the build-outs proceed unimpeded by the very serious health concerns and safety issues. KEY POINT: Cruise-goers, by and large, love to stay connected with the folks back home. They especially enjoy texting their many photos-by-smartphone back to family and friends. Businessmen have a need to stay in touch with the office as other passengers want to stay abreast of all the breaking news in 2020. Hence, every cruise ship will eventually become a 5G\u2013IoT paradise if they\u2019re not already. What really happened on the quarantined cruise ships is that those folks were likely quite vulnerable to the flu bug for a variety of reasons. Then, when they entered the fully operational 5G space* on the ships, their immunity was profoundly weakened so that they would be susceptible any influenza strain, including the Wuhan coronavirus\u2014COVID-19. *The cruise lines have literally put their 5G technology on super-steroids as seen in this promotion: MedallionNet\u2122: The Best Wi-Fi at Sea. 5G Nations It has also been astutely observed that those nations with the most pervasive and powerful 5G networks fully functioning are those that have suffered the biggest outbreaks of the coronavirus to date. Why should anyone be surprised at this wholly predictable outcome? The following excerpt comes from: CORONAVIRUS BOMBSHELL: This proves it should be named \u201c5G COVID-19\u201d The importance of viewing the coronavirus COVID-19 as a \u201cTelephone Disease\u201d is that by doing so it explains some perplexing mysteries about the spread of this disease\u2014such as why this disease has struck the Gulf nations and monarchies in the Persian Gulf region, but becomes explainable when one notices their ongoing 5G revolution\u2014most particularly in Iran, where this country is completely blanketed to its smallest village with 4G technology coverage\u2014but who are now putting the finishing touches on rolling out 5G technology throughout their entire nation in the coming weeks\u2014finishing touches that included Iran activating their Chinese bought 5G technology for testing\u2014that was immediately met by Iran having more coronavirus cases and deaths of any nation outside of China\u2014and whose Vice President is one of seven of their top government officials now infected. Coronavirus COVID-19 disease outbreak begins to spread in Persian Gulf nations and monarchies activating 5G technology. Both 5G Demonstration Zones such as Wuhan, China and floating 5G cruise liners are correctly considered 5G Hotspots. These 5G Hotspots, for the uninitiated, are really KILL ZONES because many folks will die early the longer they bask in those dangerously high levels of 5G radio-frequencies and microwave radiation. The following excerpt from a previous expos\u00e9 provides critical links for every individual who lives, works and/or plays in a 5G Super-Hotspots. Which brings us to the single most perilous aspect of the military deployment of 5G\u2014KILL ZONES. All the scientific evidence available in the public domain now indicates that wherever 5G infrastructure is located in the greatest concentration generating the most powerful EMFs and microwaves, those 5G Super-Hotspots will effectively function as kill zones. As follows: In order to fully grasp the highly destructive and deadly potential of these rapidly emerging 5G Super-Hotspots, the following video expos\u00e9 presents a scenario where the most powerful \u201cdirected energy weapons\u201d will be located within these 5G kill zones. Which bring us to the primary purpose of this article\u20145G Syndrome. 5G Syndrome 5G Syndrome is a relatively new disease that has yet to go mainstream because of how its official recognition would immediately terminate the ongoing 5G roll-out. Exactly what are the symptoms of 5G Syndrome? There are many, and they manifest differently in each victim of this insidious disease. Of course, a good number of typical flu symptoms mimic 5G Syndrome. But what\u2019s most important is that these two illnesses \u2014 Influenza and 5G Syndrome \u2014 will mutually sustain each other. In that way, it can be quite confusing to accurately tease out which symptoms are associated with which disease. In other words, if you have the flu, your exposure to 5G will make it much worse. Likewise, if you have a case of full-blown 5G Syndrome, you will be much more susceptible to getting the flu, and if you do, it will be significantly worse. Back to the primary symptoms. The best medical reference that we have at this point, since 5G Syndrome is still a relatively new medical phenomenon, is another disease known variously EMF Hypersensitivity Illness and Electrohypersensitivity (EHS). What follows are just a few of the most common symptoms that are frequently experienced by people who know they have EHS. (Also, see the preceding diagram.) Nausea, headaches and migraines Ringing in the ears Numbness in the face or other body parts Dry eyes and sight problems Inability to concentrate and unexplained fatigue Depression Tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmia Hyperactivity and insomnia Redness and rashes Dryness in the throat and mouth Swollen sinuses and symptoms rhinitis (Source: Electrohypersensitivity: What you need to know about the allergy of the 21st century) There are several other symptoms that are also being recognized as the direct result of intensive EMF and microwave exposures. As follows: Headaches, migraines Chronic exhaustion Inner agitation Sleeplessness, daytime sleepiness Tinnitus Susceptibility to infection Nervous and connective tissue pains, for which the usual causes do not explain even the most conspicuous symptoms. (Source: Electrohypersensitivity: What you need to know about the allergy of the 21st century) KEY POINT: It\u2019s essential to correctly comprehend the difference between 5G Syndrome and 5G flu. While there are several similarities, it\u2019s the differences that really matter. Hence, every smartphone user and IoT enthusiast is compelled to contemplate any new health conditions or unusual symptoms or inexplicable sickness, particularly those that have been chronic and/or long term. See: CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL REPORT: Worldwide Outbreaks of 5G Syndrome and 5G Flu Driving Pandemic Conclusion The Wuhan coronavirus pandemic has awakened many to the reality of 5G Syndrome. Perhaps it took all of humanity to get freaked out by a scary frankenvirus \u2014 COVID-19 \u2014 in order to wake up to this extreme and growing danger in our midst\u20145G technology and the slowly emerging IoT. With this crucial understanding, at least now we know what we\u2019re really dealing with. So, the best thing informed people can do is pass the word around: It\u2019s really 5G and your smartphone that is causing the current pandemic, not necessarily the coronavirus or even any of the many other flu bugs circulating around the planet in 2020. Now many folks will naturally get a bad case of one of the many types of influenzas, or even the coronavirus itself, and they will need to take that illness/disease very seriously. If they are elderly or infirm or suffer from other illnesses, they especially need to follow the best advice out there. For the sake of prevention, there is this sage advice: Here\u2019s How Everyone Can Avoid Getting The Coronavirus. For other alternative treatments and holistic approaches, excellent guidance such as this can be followed: Natural Protection Strategy Against Viruses, Including the Coronavirus Lastly, it\u2019s important to note that the 5G Syndrome angle presented here is only one of several perspectives concerning what is really an ongoing series of bioterrorist attacks being carried out in 5G-intensive zones. The perpetrators are continuing the bio-attacks wherever they must cover up an epidemic of 5G syndrome so that the worldwide military deployment of 5G is not jeopardized by disclosures about the extremely serious health dangers and safety hazards. Do you see how they do it?! The NWO globalists are very clever, aren\u2019t they? State of the Nation March 1, 2020 Author\u2019s Note This \u201cCORONAVIRUS HOAX\u201d does not mean there is not a highly contagious bioengineered coronavirus that is being released as a bioweapon in the nations that have experienced the ongoing bioterrorists attacks. It means that these stealthy bio-attacks were meant to cover up the raging epidemics of 5G Syndrome in those specific locations. So, the coronavirus is quite real just as SARS and MERS, Bird Flu and Swine Flu were real. But, the Wuhan coronavirus was specifically bioengineered in order to create and hype a global pandemic around COVID-19. Again, the hoax aspect does not refer to a non-existent coronavirus; that frankenvirus is quite real indeed and being cunningly used as a decoy.

                              "text": "Introduction by Dee McLachlan The first study demonstrating a relationship between \u201ccoronavirus\u201d outbreaks and the presence of 5G networks has emerged from Spain and is by Bartomeu Payeras i Cifre. Bartomeu is a biologist specializing in microbiology and is working at the University of Barcelona. His original source study can be sourced HERE , and is has been translated into English by Claire Edwards ( on SOTN ). The study, I believe, is hugely significant in that it demonstrates clearly the most likely probability that the COVID-19 hypoxic injuries and hospital admissions are directly related to electromagnetic radiation exposure by 5G Networks. Governments across the world can argue \u2018till the cows come home that 5G is safe and that there is no correlation to the coronavirus outbreaks \u2014 but the revelation of this data seems irrefutable. Some of the more startling discoveries are: The nine countries with the most infections worldwide all receive 5G radiation from satellites. Comparing four nearby countries of the same latitude: Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece. The two countries with 5G (Spain and Italy) have 220% more infections than Portugal and Greece. The comparison between the small State of San Marino (Italy) and Croatia (just across the Adriatic Sea) is astonishing. San Marino was the first European state to get 5G technology, and has the highest rate of infection. San Marino is 2.59 times more than Italy and 27 times more than Croatia \u2014 a country that does not have 5G. The five hot cities in Italy align with the 5G rollouts, as does Spain. Even the hot spots in Barcelona and Madrid align with 5G coverage. Another very interesting comparison is between Mexico and the US. Rates in the 5G-US are 2.7 per 1000 inhabitants, whereas Mexico (no 5G) is 0.04/1000. Another astonishing observation is Africa \u2014 a continent almost devoid of infections, except for South Africa. Well Bartomeu claims that only South Africa has 5G. As a further observation from me, most of the Australian cases were from those off the 5G-cruise ships and coming off international flights. Were they flying close to 5G satellites? Bartomeu\u2019s observations about 5G-China and surrounding countries is yet another red flag. The countries surrounding China had approximately 10X fewer cases. Myanma has 0.0007/1000 inhabitants infection rate. It is clear from this biologist\u2019s research that 5G plays a part in this plandemic. One has to assume the government researchers know of the impacts on the human body. It would be easy and inexpensive to conduct experiments to test the health impact on humans and other life forms. They must have decided the risk of 5G frequencies worth taking. The only discussion remaining is: do the benefits of 5G outweigh the deaths and health effects of EMF radiation on humans and all life on the planet? With that said, I now post Ms Edwards\u2019 translation of Bartomeu\u2019s study: by Bartomeu Payeras i Cifre The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects in early 2020 have surprised scientists and politicians. If any study aimed at understanding the phenomenon and which consequently may help to clarify the causes of the pandemic is carried out, it should be promoted and/or taken into consideration. The correlation between cases of coronavirus and the presence of 5G networks has been addressed in alternative media and social networks. It is noteworthy that, at least in Spain, the media have not covered the scientific studies on the subject of 5G, nor asked the government any questions about this in the daily press conferences that it conducts to report on the state of the situation. The team of scientists advising the Spanish government has also failed to raise this issue. It is common sense that the ability to demonstrate this correlation would be very important data to contribute to the understanding of, and the solution to, the problem. Objective To assess whether a correlation exists between cases of coronavirus and the presence of 5G networks. Without entering for the moment into subsequent cause-effect approaches in the case of positive results. Given that there is a sufficiently large statistical sample, it is possible for the results obtained to have a high level of reliability. Material and methods The study has benefited from the official statistical material published daily, which is a basic and valuable tool. It should be noted that in these publications, the methodology used for counting cases of coronavirus infections does not generally provide real data. In Spain and many other countries, it has not been calculated as there are not enough tests for such analyses. However, this does not alter the results of this study since it is based on the comparative rather than the absolute method of infection. Therefore, in order to avoid statistical error, we will compare the density value of confirmed cases of coronavirus (expressed in number of cases per 1000 inhabitants) instead of absolute values. Since the criterion for counting used by the health authorities within the same state or city is the same, the comparison of published values for different cities or regions will be equally reliable for statistics. Comparisons between different countries of confirmed cases, excluding asymptomatic cases, will be equally reliable. The possible exception of some non-transparent country that could manipulate the publication of its data is beyond the control of this study. The method used was to compare the incidence (no. of cases per 1000 inhabitants) between countries with and without 5G technology. Between regions of the same country with and without 5G technology. Between cities of the same state with and without 5G technology. Between different neighbourhoods of the same city with the 5G network map of that city. Comparing states with common borders with and without 5G technology. Comparing the case of one state within another, as is the case of San Marino. The data for each chart were taken on the same day.

In May 2020, a video started to circulate online that supposedly showed an Italian politician calling for the arrest of Bill Gates, the former Microsoft CEO who has been at the center of several conspiracy theories due to his foundation\u2019s work to develop a vaccine for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. This video was frequently shared on social media with the caption, \u201cItalian Government call for arrest of Bill Gates\u201d: This is a genuine video of an Italian politician calling for Gates\u2019 arrest. However, a single politician\u2019s opinion does not equate to the entire Italian government calling for action. In fact, this view has been condemned by Italian government officials (you can hear this politician being told \u201cenough\u201d and to be quiet during the video). The politician in this video is Italian Parliament Member Sara Cunial. She\u2019s part of Italy\u2019s \u201c5 Star Movement,\u201d a political party that has been blamed for a rise of measles in Italy after pushing an anti-vaccination agenda. Cunial, who was briefly suspended from the party in 2018 after likening vaccines to \u201cfree genocide\u201d in a Facebook post, was fined in April 2020 for violating one of the country\u2019s shelter-in place policies to visit a beach. (Cunial claims she was never fined.) Cunial\u2019s speech before the Italian Parliament hit on a number of popular (and discredited) conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19. For instance, she linked the spread of the disease to the rise of 5G technology, claimed that Gates was working to de-populate the world, and said that the \u201cID2020\u201d coalition was working to secretly implement digital microchips via mandatory vaccines. Cunial also fabricated a quote from Gates. After claiming that this was an \u201cexact quote\u201d from a Gates\u2019 speech, Cunial falsely said that the former Microsoft CEO once stated, \u201cIf we do a good job on vaccines, health and reproduction, we can reduce the world population by 10-15%. Only a genocide can save the world.\u201d Not only is this a fabricated quote, it illustrates a common misconception about Gates\u2019 work related to global population. The former Microsoft CEO is working to lower child mortality, improve the health of poorer populations, and give people better access to contraceptives. In other words, Gates is not trying to use vaccines to kill children. Rather, he is hoping that a lower child mortality rate and better supportive programs will reduce the need for parents to have more children. Gates articulated his goals in a 2009 letter from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: A surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the number of deaths actually reduces population growth. [\u2026] Contrary to the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children. Not only was Cunial\u2019s speech littered with conspiracy theories, the politician also blamed Italy\u2019s leadership for allowing dogmatic scientism to become the \u201ctrue cultural epidemic\u201d of this country. This comment created some blowback (Cunial curiously claimed that she was not referring to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte) and some politicians urged her to apologize for the remark. Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies Mara Carfagna wrote on Twitter: \u201cConnecting phantom plots to the Head of State is unworthy of an institutional representative.\u201d Sostenere teorie assurde e infondate a @Montecitorio \u00e8 grave, soprattutto in una emergenza sanitaria. Collegare fantomatici complotti al Capo dello Stato \u00e8 indegno di un rappresentante istituzionale. Il Presidente Mattarella \u00e8 un solido presidio di libert\u00e0 e democrazia.#Cunial \u2014 Mara Carfagna (@mara_carfagna) May 14, 2020 In sum, it is true that an Italian politician spouted a number of conspiracy theories and called for the arrest of Gates during an address to Parliament. However, this viewpoint was not widely endorsed by the Italian government.",

According to the information obtained on the official website of ID2020 alliance, for you to get any attention or support to fight poverty, sickness and obtain any good thing in life, you must have a chip implanted in your body, an identification mark that gives you access in the new world order. If you are a Bible student, you will understand what the Bible says concerning this mark in the book of Revelations Chapter 13 verses 16 \u2013 18. This ID2020 Alliance started a long time ago but was officially presented in 2018 in a more formal articulation and ethical approaches to digital identity, by an eleven-member board, in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Now, to achieve the Digital Identification of everyone on earth, a microchip most be implanted under the skin of everyone. And the only ways to achieve this is to try and make people to willingly accept the implant on their bodies, or put fear in people that will make them accept it. Guess what? they decided to use the two options; that is, to put fear in people and make everyone willingly accept the Microchip. These are the facts All existing generation networks up to 4G are not capable of delivering the speed that is required to power all essential services that Digital identification requires to work efficiently, therefore the 5G is required with high frequency at short distances. 5G is the only network for the future. Without 5G, there is no appreciable advancement that can be done in technology. This is the reason why they want 5G rolled out at all cost. Because China is in trade, technology and economic war with USA, they decided to work fast enough to be the first to lunch the 5G network. Sometimes in July 2019 5G network was rolled out in the city of Wuhan. Then later on, the USA, UK, Italy, France, Iran and others rolled out their 5G in selected Cities in their Countries, not with the primary intention to kill people but the 5G network is inevitable. The people behind this understands that the 5G is harmful, but the only way to know the extent of damage it can cause is to test it. China wants to be ahead so they agreed to use the \u201cnew\u201d innovation in a City where they can easily attribute the cause of death that may likely occur to a virus. Wuhan was known for eating live animals that can easily transmit virus to human, hence the decision to use the City. The effect of the radiation of 5G network on human body will take about bout 5 to 6 months to evidently manifest, according to Science tech researchers. So, the plan was that, once they have casualty, they will quickly perform experiment on the dead body to ascertain the type of damage that took place in the cells of the body and quickly write a code that can prevent this damage from taking place within the body and put it in the microchip that will be implanted under the skin of everyone. This is the vaccine that Bill Gates was talking about. Anybody who has it implanted on his or her skin will not die of 5G radiation damage. They will say you have been vaccinated and you are no more a danger to human community and so you will be permitted to perform transactions over the 5G network, such as buying and selling under the new world order. The people dying now are just the collateral damages that must take place before they get their vaccine fully ready for deployment, which is the microchip, that is carrying every other information required to power the next generation technology of Artificial intelligence. Some scientists will tell you that 5G network has nonionizing radiation and so cannot break chemical bonds, but it\u2019s not true. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2011 classified RFR as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\". Then in 2012, $30 million study conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) found \u201cclear evidence\u201d that two years of exposure to cell phone 2nd, 3rd and 4th Generation RFR increased cancer in male rats and damaged DNA in rats and mice of both sexes. The Ramazzini Institute in Italy also replicated these findings and had the same result, how much more the 5G with 10 times frequency emission efficiency. Now, Bill Gates and Co understands that the 5G network is the only network that can work with the microchips to be implanted in man to achieve the digital identification number, they decided to widen the scope of the conspiracy. Once the 5G is installed across test run countries, and in few months begins to cause damage to the cells in form of seizures and instant death, they then conspired to attribute the cause of death to a virus. Since the deaths will definitely occur first in Wuhan, being the first City to roll out 5G, they then prepared a highly contagious Covid-19 and introduced it amongst the people so that they can easily attribute the cause of death to Corona Virus. The people you see that are dying in their hundreds have been so much exposed to the 5G radiation, so that once corona virus attacks them, they can never survive it. These are the people you see that will just fall down and die in streets and homes. Corona virus is not that dangerous as they make it seem to you. It can be treated. The actual cause of death is radiation from 5G. This situation will now cause great fear in the hearts of people and they will be ready to accept and embrace any solution. Now, Bill Gates and Co have developed a MicroChip and then lie to the people that it is the vaccine that will immunize the people against Coronavirus. Meanwhile, it is a microchip that will store all the information required for artificial intelligence and also protect humans from radiation damage. The so-called vaccine will be communicating with the 5G network to transmit information. Only those who refused to take the vaccine will be dying from Radiation, but they will lie that it is the coronavirus killing them, that until they take the vaccine everyone will continue to die. Trust me, nobody wants to die a painful death, so people will be submitting to the vaccine from Bill Gates Everything about you will be stored in that chip. The ability to withdraw any money you have in the Bank will be stored on the chip. You will not need to carry any card or any information on you again because you have been digitally connected to a central server ready for the one world government, one world economy and one world religion. You will be paid money directly to your account but those who have not received their vaccine which contains the microchip will not be able to spend the money. They cannot buy nor sell. This is why I am so scared of the much talked about the Grants (the Aid from Jack ma, Bill gates)for the poor in Africa, because part of what they will use to entice people is money. They will give Presidents of nations money to adopt and install 5G networks first in their major Cities and then to other Cities. They will also give huge money to Citizens of Africa through Cooperatives and NGOs. The use of this money by the recipients will only be possible if they have been vaccinated. A lot of people will be vaccinated in other to get the money. Remember that both the Government and everybody is broke now and will be ready to do anything to get funded. It is only illuminati (UN, WHO)that can give 10million to 40 million people in a country. This amounts to 400 trillion. Only the gods of this world can pay this huge amount to each Country in Africa. Here is my advice to you if you are waiting for any grant from anywhere, as soon as they ask you to get vaccinated before you can access your grant, please run for your life. And if you are yet to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal savior please do now. The end has not come, but it is nearer. What is really going on with Covid-19 is far too big, too complex, too sinister, too evil, too bizarre and too extraordinary for the average mind to comprehend or accept. If you stay in major cities just be observant after the lockdown to see the new installations of 5G networks in some locations. I watched some videos online of these installations but I cannot confirm to you if they are actually the 5G installations. If, however, the installations are for the 5G, this means that they locked you down so that they can do the work. Why was Bill gates saying that more people will die in Africa and especially kenya and that the vaccines should be moved down to Africa? The Deaths you are seeing now in Africa at large is the one from Coronavirus and that is why it is not much because it can be treated, and people are recovering from it. After 5 to 6 months of switching on the new 5G network, you will be surprised with the death records we will be having, and they will tell you it\u2019s from Covid-19. Here are some of the international frontline NGOs that are involved: 1. Mercy Corps. 2. KIVA non-profit organization 3. Hyperledger umbrella 4. iRespond non-profit organization 5. Care international 6. Simprints non-profit 7. International Computing Centre 8. FHI360 9. CITRIS Policy Lab and several other NGOs who are working with these major ones to distribute money to the poor. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong; 5G will connect you to everything you can think of. In fact, it is referred to as internet of everything, but it is also a gateway to where you don\u2019t want to go. The good news is that the rapture must take place before they can be in full charge of the world. The microchip implant in the body is what the Holy Bible describes as the \"Mark of the Beast\" \u201c666\u201d in the Book of Revelations chapter 13 and once you take it you are doomed forever.",

When it comes to the latest technologies for testing, treating, and preventing the spread of covid-19, there\u2019s no one on MIT Technology Review\u2019s staff who\u2019s better connected and better informed than Antonio Regalado, the magazine\u2019s senior biomedicine editor. Since February, he\u2019s been self-isolating with his family at their farm house in Maine, while continuing to report on the pandemic. We talked with Antonio about why it\u2019s taking so long to scale up coronavirus testing, what new vaccine technologies look most promising, and why he started prepping for the worst way back in January.

The breakthrough might happen, but it might not. Wade Roush: To get the coronavirus pandemic under control, government officials say we\u2019ll need brand-new technologies for testing that allow us to diagnose more people, faster. But Antonio Regalado, Technology Review\u2019s biomedicine editor, thinks that\u2019s a lot of eggs to put in one basket. Antonio Regalado: I mean, a breakthrough is something that happens or it doesn't. I mean, it's hard to predict ahead of time. What we want is a technology where there's a clear path and it's a matter of doing it and a matter of overcoming obstacles. Wade Roush: We\u2019ll talk about why the effort to scale up coronavirus testing is going so slowly here in the US, and which technologies do have the best chance of working\u2014both for diagnostic testing and, eventually, for making a vaccine against the virus. I\u2019m Wade Roush, and this is Deep Tech. [Deep Tech theme] Wade Roush: Recently the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Deborah Birx, went on Meet the Press and told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd that one key to ending the coronavirus lockdown and letting states restart their economies will be developing a new way to test whether people are infected. Deborah Birx: We have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing. We have to be able to detect antigen, rather than constantly trying to detect the actual live virus or viral particles itself, and to really move into antigen testing. And I know corporations in diagnostics are working on that now. We have to have a breakthrough. This RNA testing will carry us certainly through the spring and summer, but we need to have a huge technology breakthrough and we\u2019re working on that at the same time. Wade Roush: Here at Technology Review, we\u2019re all about covering breakthroughs. Which is why we know you can\u2019t just snap your fingers and make one happen. Antonio Regalado covers the latest advances in biomedical research, and he\u2019s been reporting for months on all aspects of the coronavirus response, from testing to antiviral drugs to novel types of vaccines. So I knew he\u2019d have some thoughts about Dr. Birx\u2019s pronouncement\u2014and that he\u2019d be able to tell us how close we really are to having a simple at-home antigen test that could substitute for the slow and complicated genetic testing that\u2019s currently our main way to check for the virus. I reached Antonio at his farm house in Maine. But before we even talked about the science, I wanted to know why he started getting ready for a crisis way back in January, before the rest of us were even paying attention to this new coronavirus. Wade Roush: It didn't really take you long to start preparing for the coronavirus pandemic in a way that might have seemed extreme to the rest of us at that time. So how and when did you realize that this was going to be probably the most dramatic, most impactful pandemic of our lifetimes? Antonio Regalado: When I first heard about the Wuhan virus\u2014I guess as Trump calls it, we\u2019re not supposed to call it that, at the time, though, in January, it was definitely the virus in Wuhan, far away\u2014it looked basically exactly like SARS. And so just personally, I said, well, you know, I spent a year working on SARS and then SARS went away. And so my decision early on was that. I was going to ignore this virus. And I would leave it to public health reporters to cover it. Antonio Regalado: So that was early or middle of January. By the end of January, I had spoken to a venture capitalist named Robert Nelson. He's a partner at Arch Venture Partners, a kind of influential biotech investor. And his Twitter feed had turned quite alarming. Like, he was clearly very alarmed by this virus. So I called him up and I asked him to tell me, you know, what was going through his head. And he was very, very concerned that this was what he called sort of a global train wreck in slow motion. Within a couple of days of speaking to Robert Nelson, I sent my wife the following e-mail. and I'll read it to you. On January 28, 2020. Antonio Regalado wrote to his wife under the subject line, Pandemic Shopping List, \"Please obtain: three bottles of bleach, several milks in box, the European kind you can keep at room temperature. Large bags of: carrots, onions, potatoes, beans and rice.\" Antonio Regalado: So on January 28, my paranoia was high and by then, I was trying to prepare by acquiring the supplies that I would need to weather the pandemic. But it wasn't until a month later that I actually wrote a story that we published in Technology Review about prepping, just for the reason that you mentioned. It seems like a crazy, paranoid thing to do when the virus is far away. In fact, my wife, I have her reply. She replied to me, \u201cReally? Why? Is one coming?,\u201d she said of the pandemic. And I said, back to her, \u201cWell, there is one in China.\u201d Wade Roush: Yeah. Well, in retrospect, the idea of laying in weeks' worth of supplies, just in case you weren't able to go back to the store to get groceries, that seems really smart. And I'm just curious about whether in your mind, there's still a line between rational prepping and survivalist Montana mountain man prepping. Do you know what I'm getting at? Antonio Regalado: I do. I do. Let's face it, prepping is anti-social. It is anti-social to acquire a bunch of supplies for your personal use, then lock the doors of your cabin. I don't really have much insight into the hardcore preppers, you know, people who have weapons and stuff and a bunker underground. I mean, clearly in a certain community of people close to technology, when they were worried about the virus, when they started prepping, has now become sort of a badge of honor. And they make noise of it. I would say in my case as a journalist, it was more an attempt to be close to the story and be part of the story. If other people are prepping and I'm going to write about it, then I wanted to prep, too. Wade Roush: But you're glad to have the extra bottles of bleach and the extra cans of beans. Antonio Regalado: I have a hundred pounds of flour. Other people can't get flour. And I'm trying to think about how I can participate, other than through the journalism. Should I stop doing journalism and become a contact tracer? Should I give away half my flour to somebody else who needs it? These are the questions of the day. Wade Roush: Let's talk next about testing. So we know that one key to eventually scaling back self-isolation and quarantining and social distancing will be massively expanding the number of people who can get tested for the coronavirus up to the point where ideally you can test millions of people per day. But the dominant technology that's being used for that right now is something called PCR or RT-PCR. And it's apparently really difficult to scale up, because we're not doing very well at it. So could you explain for us what RT-PCR is, and why the expansion of that kind of testing is still taking so long? Antonio Regalado: Yeah. Well, when these testing problems first started to arise and be reported, it was mind-boggling to me, because PCR, polymerase chain reaction, is not a new technology. It was developed in the \u201980s. And it's something that every single graduate student in a biology lab knows how to do. So I was kind of astonished that there was a discussion going on about PCR. You know, how is it that people have forgotten how to do this bread and butter activity? And why is it that the ability to do this test is somehow contingent on some kind of government approval or government supplies? So all that was very strange to me, because PCR is so fundamental to genetic research. Antonio Regalado: What it does is basically just amplify DNA. You have a little bit of DNA and PCR is what you use to multiply it into lots of DNA that you can then easily measure. So it turns out, though, that the whole sort of infrastructure for doing PCR testing is more fragile than we knew, and harder scale up than we would have thought. And that is because initially some of the chemicals that were used to kind of guide the PCR reaction were flawed. They didn't work correctly. Then suddenly there was a shortage of those pieces. They're called primers. That was resolved. But then there was a shortage of something that else that you needed, another chemical to basically turn the virus's RNA into DNA. It's called reverse transcriptase. There was a suddenly a shortage of that. Antonio Regalado: So you can think about it as cooking. You know, for cooking, you need flour and you need sugar and you need a bowl and you need a mixing spoon and you need all these things. And so what happened with the testing is, there was a crisis in the supply of every one of those things that happened at different times. So everybody wanted to cook brownies at exactly the same time. And that was the problem with scaling up. There just wasn't enough of all these different materials. But the process itself, apparently, is a little bit hard to scale up to millions or tens of millions just using PCR. So people are looking at different technologies that might be more amenable to sort of massive-scale testing. Wade Roush: So Deborah Birx, who's the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, has started talking about antigen testing, which is an approach that wouldn't rely on PCR, as I understand it. That's one of the new forms of testing that could perhaps come to the rescue, but I imagine it has its own scaling issues. Antonio Regalado: Getting to this question of how to scale up testing in a massive way, there's sort of two general categories of where new technology can help. One is massive centralized testing. And the second is massive decentralized testing. So let me just talk about the centralized testing first. Right now, the PCR testing is centralized. The samples are sent to clinical laboratories, public health laboratories, commercial companies like LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics that have centers, facilities that do the testing. And that accounts for the delay. Like people are having long delays in getting their test results, four or five days. Antonio Regalado: So there are ideas that are coming out of the genome centers like the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, out of UCLA, out of Berkeley. And these are schemes for doing massive testing by using the genome sequencing machines that are normally used to sequence human genomes. And so what people have come up with are schemes by which thousands, tens of thousands, even millions of samples, say, from all over the country could be pooled together and then read out on these speedy sequencing machines. Antonio Regalado: So that's one idea people have. But it's still, even though they believe that it could get to the scale of millions, there are a couple of problems with it. One problem is just the logistics, like how do you get all those swabs into one place? And the other thing is that it's still not in real time. This massive centralized testing, there's still delay. You\u2019ve got to collect the swabs. You got to send them somewhere, and then you have to get the results and you have to report the results back. So it's still a delay. Antonio Regalado: The other category of test, which relates to Deborah Birx's comment, is massive decentralized testing. What happens if there was a test that everybody could use from home before you go to work? After you go to work? Once a week, twice a week, you could test yourself, and have an idea whether you were infected and if you were, then you could, you would know what to do. You'd have to stay home, get in touch with public health authorities, call your contacts and let them know that you have this virus. So there's different ways in theory to do this at home testing. Deborah Birx is talking about an antigen test. An antigen test is when you have an antibody that sticks to the virus. It's in a little tiny test kit. You're looking for this spike protein on the surface of the virus or maybe some other thing that is actually on the virus poking out of it. The way I understand it is you have a test strip with antibodies and that that is going to stick to that antigen if it is in your nasal swab. But there's some questions about whether an antigen test is actually going to work. The problem with antigen tests is that they have not worked well for respiratory viruses. Wade Roush: Antonio says that there\u2019s a potential middle ground here. It\u2019s the idea of a simplified genetic test that would combine the accuracy of PCR-based testing with the convenience of decentralized at-home testing. Antonio Regalado: Who's working on at-home genetic tests? Well, some of the molecular biologists who were working on the sort of large-scale schemes are also working on the chemistry for an at home test. One of them is Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. And he works with this technology CRISPR, which is known for gene editing. But it turns out you can adapt it also to make a simplified genetic test format. So they're trying to figure out, can they make it even simpler and can they package it up in a way that would make it the basis for an at home genetic test? Another person working on it is a well-known entrepreneur named Jonathan Rothberg. He\u2019s quite a character. He's in quarantine on his super-yacht, the Gene Machine. But he's also someone with a ton of resources which he has been marshalling to try and create an at-home genetic test. And they actually have prototypes that they're testing at Yale on real patient samples. And they are working on developing a little device, which would sort of automatically mix the samples, it\u2019s about the size of a credit card. And the idea is that this would be a genetic test that you could do at home. And it turns out that the chemistry is not necessarily the hardest part. There\u2019s all these other practical elements. Wade Roush: If we're gonna have a huge breakthrough, do you think it's going to come from the bottom up, or are there any signs of any sort of top-down leadership on this? Antonio Regalado: I don\u2019t know what Deborah Birx meant by a breakthrough, but from what I know of emerging technology, we shouldn't be counting on breakthroughs, right? I mean, breakthrough is something that happens or it doesn't. You know, it's hard to predict ahead of time. What we want is a technology where there's a clear path and it's a matter of doing it, and a matter of overcoming obstacles. Antonio Regalado: Sri Kosuri is a researcher at UCLA who I spoke with. And he's working on a procedure by which tens of thousands of patient samples could be pooled together and then run on a sequencing machine. So he came up with this concept and I just asked him, well, who's gonna do this? Are you going to do this? Who's gonna do this? And he said that the problem was that kind of everybody is waiting for somebody else to take the action. The people who can solve the logistics, they don't necessarily believe that the technologists can do this massive testing, whereas the academics, they're not in a position to do the logistics of collecting the samples. So there's this kind of game of a chicken and egg is as he described it. Antonio Regalado: I think that certain locations like Boston or San Francisco, where they have this concentration of academic medical centers and researchers, they're going to take the lead. And I think pretty soon we'll see a new testing scheme arise in those areas. And once they do that, other people will follow suit. Wade Roush: Great. OK. So, Antonio, let's finish up by talking about the perhaps the biggest tool of all for ending this pandemic, and that's vaccines. To your mind, what are some of the most interesting and provocative approaches that people are exploring right now to developing a vaccine against the coronavirus? Antonio Regalado: Yeah, well, actually, the vaccine efforts got underway very quickly, unlike the testing. As soon as that sequence of the coronavirus became available, the people working on vaccines immediately grabbed it and started work. The sequence of the virus is the essential starting point for the vaccine, and in fact, the first vaccine to reach clinical trials, I think they began in late February or early March, is one from a Boston-area biotech called Moderna Pharmaceuticals. And they have a new approach to making vaccines, in which they basically take the genetic code, a snippet of the genetic code from the virus, stick it inside a nanoparticle like a little ball of fat, and they inject that into people. So the goal is that your own cells will take that information and start making this little bit of the virus. Your body will react to it and you'll become immunized. Antonio Regalado: And what's interesting about Moderna\u2019s approach is just the speed with which they were able to go from the sequence of the virus to their candidate drug or their candidate vaccine. It only took them a couple of months. So early on in the pandemic, we already had, you know, a new benchmark that was set for how fast a vaccine candidate could be prepared. Of course, it doesn't mean theirs will work. In fact, there's no vaccine of that type that's widely used or licensed. So we may end up looking instead to more conventional types of vaccines, of which there's a number of strategies to make them. And I looked at the World Health Organization, and I think that they count something like 50 or so different vaccine efforts. So there's a huge number of vaccines in development, each using a sort of slightly different technology. Wade Roush: Ok, so one virtue of these new innovative approaches, like Moderna's, is they might be faster to implement. But do they also have the downside that they're just so new that we're not sure exactly how they're going to work in the body yet, and they have to go through like an equally lengthy testing period to make sure they are safe? Antonio Regalado: Correct. And this gets back to the point of, you know, waiting for a breakthrough. This is not the time to count on a breakthrough. The breakthrough might happen, but it might not. So, you know, at different extremes is the Moderna vaccine, which is used as a very clever idea. It's very fast to get started. But there's no existing vaccine that's widely used that\u2019s based on this technology. So it's simply unproven whether it makes an effective vaccine that could be manufactured at large scale. We just don't know that. At the other extreme or companies like Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, and others who are using what they call vaccine platforms that have a history of success. There's actually vaccines that are out there that are made using these approaches. They take a little bit longer, or quite a lot longer, but they may in the end be the better bet. We just don't know. So I think a lot of people are saying, well, we need to bet and bet big on all the approaches. Wade Roush: Ok, Antonio, thank you so much for sharing all this today. And stay safe up there in Maine. Antonio Regalado: Great. Thank you, Wade.

The TV screen company, Grazie Media, pulled the ad after a few hours. The ad said: \"\"If you\u2019re an adult who enjoys a good beer, there\u2019s a similar product you might want to know about, one without all the calories and serious health problems. Less toxic so it doesn\u2019t cause hangovers or overdose deaths. And it\u2019s not linked to violence or reckless behavior. Marijuana. Less harmful than alcohol and time to treat it that way.\"\" In this fact-check, we decided to focus on the idea that marijuana is \"\"less toxic\"\" than alcohol. \"\"I don\u2019t see how this could be a more open-and-shut case,\"\" Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which produced the ad, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. \"\"If you consume too much alcohol in a sitting or over the course of your life, you can die. If you consume too much (marijuana) in a sitting or over the course of your life, you do not die. What more could be needed to prove marijuana is \u2018less toxic\u2019 than alcohol?\"\" Yet, as a rebuttal, some health professionals say it\u2019s a matter of picking your poison. \"\"It\u2019s like trying to compare different weapons. Both have the potential to cause harm,\"\" said Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine, at University of Florida. \"\"I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a clear answer.\"\" For starters, the term toxic can be vague. Dr. Cynthia Lewis-Younger, medical director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Tampa, said toxic can be \"\"anything that causes harm. It is possible to drink enough water to poison yourself. It\u2019s more related to the dose than anything else.\"\" The Marijuana Policy Project\u2019s claim that marijuana is \"\"less toxic\"\" rankles some health professionals and anti-drug organizations who criticize the inference that using the drug is okay. Calvina Fay, executive director of the Drug Free America Foundation, said she wants the public to realize that \"\"these are two drugs that are both addictive and impairing and they both create unsafe situations.\"\" Briefly, here\u2019s a look at how the National Institute on Drug Abuse describes each drug. Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars and starches and while it may start as a stimulant in small doses, NIDA describes it as a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream. Intoxication can impair brain function and motor skills and heavy use can increase risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver disease. Marijuana is a dry, shredded green and brown mix of leaves, flowers, stems and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. The main psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. When marijuana is smoked, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the brain and other organs. Activists on both sides of the marijuana issue can find studies that back up their claims about the health impact of smoking weed. NIDA states in an email that the effect of marijuana can depend on the person (their biology) who\u2019s using it, the amount and under what circumstances. \"\"Claiming that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol cannot be substantiated since each possess their own unique set of risks and consequences for a given individual,\"\" according to an agency email statement. Statistics certainly paint a grim picture of the lethal impact of alcohol abuse. The Centers for Disease Control\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics reports that there were 41,682 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010, the last year with the most exact statistics. That breaks down to 15,990 deaths attributed to alcoholic liver disease and 25,692 other alcohol-induced deaths, excluding accidents and homicides. The center doesn\u2019t have any reports of marijuana listed as a cause of death. In 2006, there were more than 1.2 million emergency room visits and 2.7 million physician office visits due to excessive drinking, the CDC reports on its website. \"\"Alcohol in excess is probably the No. 1 cause of toxicities from drugs of abuse in the world simply because it\u2019s most widely used,\"\" Lewis-Younger said. Robert Gable wrote in an American Scientist article in 2006 that \"\"simply tallying the number of people who die or who show up at emergency rooms is, by itself, meaningless,\"\" because that figure is influenced by the number of people using the substance. Yet the Marijuana Policy Project\u2019s Tvert said Gable\u2019s eight-year study on recreational drugs bolsters their assertion. Gable, a retired professor of psychology at Claremont Graduate University in California, compared the toxicity of 20 abused substances using reports of experimental human and animal research and on published data of overdose fatalities. He compared the drugs by developing a safety ratio -- the ratio of an effective dose (eliciting a \"\"relaxed affability\"\") to a lethal dose. \"\"Two drinks makes you buzzy, 20 drinks puts you in the emergency room or the morgue,\"\" Gable said in a phone interview. \"\"Ten is the safety ratio\"\" for alcohol, among the most toxic recreational drugs, he said. The least physiologically toxic substances -- those requiring 100 to 1,000 times the effective dose to cause death -- included marijuana when ingested. He couldn\u2019t find any cases of documented deaths from smoked marijuana \"\"so the actual dose is a mystery.\"\" \"\"No drug is good for teenagers,\"\" he said, \u00a0\"\"but when it comes to the chances of immediate death by chemical toxicity, marijuana is about a hundred times less toxic than alcohol or cocaine.\"\" Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, notes: \"\"People could argue it (marijuana) is a weaker chemical in terms of toxicity, but it does have its consequences. It doesn\u2019t mean marijuana is harmless.\"\" Experts say one concern is the impact of marijuana on the brain, particularly for teens who start smoking early. Teitelbaum says marijuana can \"\"flip\"\" adolescents\u00a0predisposed to mental problems into having a psychotic disorder. A 2012 study from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King\u2019s College London and the University of Otago (New Zealand) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \"\"Persistent Cannabis Users Show Neuropsychological Decline from Childhood to Midlife,\"\" examined the potential relationship between the long-term use of marijuana and declines in IQ scores. The study was based on data from more than 1,037 individuals followed from birth until age 38 and determined those who began using cannabis before age 18 and became persistent users (more than once a week) suffered the greatest decline in mental functioning (an average of eight IQ points) that didn\u2019t improve once they stopped. Those who started using marijuana when they were adults didn\u2019t show the same decline. Another concern has come up in recent years. The use of synthetic marijuana, often called Spice, has become a problem,\u00a0and health professionals caution that it\u2019s vastly different from natural marijuana and more toxic. \"\"Many Spice smokers have experienced agitation, paranoia and mental illness,\"\" JoAnn Chambers-Emerson, certified specialist in poison information/educator at the Florida\u00a0Poison Information Center in Tampa, wrote in an email. \"\"Some Spice smokers have ended up having a stroke, heart attack, seizures and kidney failure. Synthenetic marijuana, however, is not marijuana. Our ruling An ad from the Marijuana Policy Project claims\u00a0marijuana is \"\"less toxic\"\" than alcohol. Our job as fact-checkers in this case is not to decide whether marijuana is good or harmful. We're focused on whether the drug in its natural form is \"\"less toxic\"\" than alcohol. In that regard, science and statistics present a strong case.\"",

                              "text": "\"On the night of April 22, 2011, Rep. Robert Watson, R-East Greenwich, was stopped at a Connecticut sobriety checkpoint and ultimately charged with both driving under the influence and marijuana possession. In a floor speech the following Tuesday, the then-House minority leader said he was not under the influence. He said he had not smoked marijuana, and his blood-alcohol level tested at 0.05, which is below the legal limit of 0.08. Watson told fellow House members he had \"\"a very small bag with trace amounts of marijuana and a smoking instrument.\"\" He was carrying the marijuana, he said, in case he had an attack of pancreatitis. \"\"I'm well aware that medical marijuana is a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition,\"\" he said in his speech, which garnered a standing ovation from Republicans and other House members at the time. (But a week later, the Republican caucus ousted him as minority leader.) Watson, citing personal privacy, has not released details of his medical record; results of his blood test will be the subject of his court hearing in Connecticut. But we wanted to weed out the facts on whether marijuana is actually recognized as a treatment for the pain of pancreatitis, an extraordinarily painful condition that Watson described as akin to a gunshot to the chest. First, some background. The pancreas, located behind the stomach, releases enzymes that aid in digestion. It also releases the insulin the body needs to control blood sugar. The enzymes flow out a tube into the small intestine near the stomach. Unfortunately, a portion of that tube is shared with the gallbladder. Sometimes tiny stones form in the gallbladder, migrate down the tube and block the portion that drains the pancreas. The result is painful inflammation -- pancreatitis. Doctors can usually see the stones with ultrasound or some other form of imaging. In those cases, either the stone eventually works its way free or doctors remove it. In either case, doctors urge patients to have the gall bladder removed. End of problem. The second major cause of pancreatitis is alcohol. When that's the case, doctors insist that patients abstain from drinking because one attack can lead to others, damaging the pancreas in a way that leads to chronic pancreatitis. \"\"The recommendation is pretty much to not take any alcohol because alcohol is a toxin to the pancreas,\"\" said Dr. Alyn Adrain, a gastroenterologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Brown University. Heavy smoking may also increase the risk, said Dr. Vikesh Singh, director of the Pancreatitis Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. That risk can be difficult to tease out because smoking and drinking often go hand in hand. Pancreatitis can also be caused by inherited deformities in the pancreas. There have also been at least two studies covering four patients suggesting that marijuana, by itself, can cause a pancreatitis attack. In other instances, doctors have trouble pinpointing a cause. Watson politely declined to answer most questions about his condition, saying he believes his health should be a private matter. Watson did, however, reveal elements of his illness during his speech on the floor of the House. He said his initial attack of pancreas pain was at Halloween. He said he went to the hospital the next day, where he had a severe reaction to a drug, prompting doctors to put him in a medically induced coma for five days. He said he subsequently had other attacks. He did not disclose the number and severity. \"\"I did treat with medical marijuana on one of those rare occasions where I had that debilitating pain that had me flat on my back\"\" wondering whether to call an ambulance, he said. He also reported having a recurrence the day before his arrest, but said he did not use marijuana then. Watson said that when he tried the drug, \"\"it provided relief and it alleviated the pain . . . I believed it was responsible self-therapy.\"\" Watson said he had not applied for authorization to use medical marijuana. But is marijuana \"\"a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition,\"\" as he contends? As a treatment for pancreatitis pain, let's be blunt. The simple answer is \"\"No.\"\" Both Doctors Singh and Adrain said there are no studies in the medical literature showing that marijuana is an effective treatment for the pain of a pancreatitis attack. \"\"There is no reason to use marijuana for acute pancreatitis,\"\" said Singh. \"\"There are no studies evaluating the use of cannabis for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain.\"\" \"\"I've never given it for chronic pain from pancreatitis and I don't know anyone who has,\"\" said Adrain. When we contacted Watson, he said his statement should be considered in the context of treatment for severe pain in general. The state's guidelines for medical marijuana use say \"\"qualifying debilitating medical conditions\"\" include \"\"a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment\"\" that produces any of six conditions, including \"\"severe, debilitating, chronic pain.\"\" In that context, the doctors we interviewed said marijuana MIGHT be useful in some cases, just as the drug helps some patients cope with cancer pain. \"\"It might help. There's just no good evidence to prove it\u2019s worthwhile,\"\" said Singh. Finally, we looked to Canada, where the use of medical marijuana has been legal for years. Health Canada, which authorizes medical marijuana use, lists seven conditions -- multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or disease, cancer, HIV, epilepsy, severe arthritis -- where the use is routinely accepted. For other conditions, a specialist must confirm \"\"that conventional treatments have failed or [are] judged inappropriate to relieve symptoms.\"\" And Dr. Mark Ware, associate medical director of the McGill University Health Centre Pain Clinic in Montreal, told us in an email that pancreatitis is a different kind of pain. \"\"This is a visceral pain syndrome and most cannabis studies have focused on neuropathic pain.\"\" The personal reports you can find on the web \"\"have not been validated or evaluated.\"\" So as far as we could determine, it's neither recognized nor recommended by the medical community for this use. There are certainly no studies to support its use.\"",

                              "text": "A blog with a pattern of publishing false and misleading stories about Canada claimed that a nationwide crackdown on public drinking and cannabis smoking was imminent in that country. In June 2019, Canada-Eh.info published a post with the headline, \u201cCanadians Can Be Fined $1,500 for Drinking or Smoking Weed in Public, Starting Next Month,\u201d which reported that: \u201cMayors are considering to bring [sic] this [sic] new tougher laws in every province of Canada, you will no longer will be able to consume alcohol or smoke weed responsibly in parks or on beaches. Fines vary from province to province, but they can be up to $1,000 in in provinces like British Columbia and Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador.\u201d The report continued on to say: \u201cIf you get caught with open alcohol in Toronto right now, you could face a fine of up to $125 and a whopping $230 in Vancouver. Tougher rules are coming for most people who like to consume alcohol or weed in public. Starting next month if you are caught drinking beer or smook [sic] weed in public, the police will pour out your alcohol and make you pay a fine $1,500.\u201d As has been the case with previous Canada-Eh stories we have examined, the claims here were at times ambiguous and confusing. More broadly, the narrative of an imminent nationwide crackdown on public drinking and smoking in July 2019 \u2014 \u201cnew tougher laws in every province of Canada\u201d \u2014 was false. As was the case with previous stories, Canada-Eh republished an almost-identical version of the post just two days later, on 12 June. Canada has no uniform nationwide policy on public alcohol consumption or cannabis use. Policies are determined by provincial governments or municipal authorities in individual cities and towns throughout the country. Most cities and provinces have historically prohibited public drinking (which belies the article\u2019s claim about a new crackdown on such behavior), but Canada\u2019s legalization of cannabis in 2018 prompted some governments to rethink their approach to drinking in public places, as the Canadian Press reported: As all corners of the country prepare for a seismic shift in how and where people consume marijuana, several cities are considering whether it would make sense to legalize drinking alcohol in parks as well \u2014 a move an expert said would bring antiquated laws in line with the way people already behave. \u201cI think a lot of people who want to have a bottle of wine in a public park on a Sunday are probably going to be doing that anyway,\u201d said Mitchell Kosny, interim director of Ryerson University\u2019s School of Urban and Regional Planning. The idea of legalizing alcohol in parks and on beaches has come up in Toronto and Vancouver, both of which are in the midst of municipal elections and both of which are in provinces that will allow people to toke in public come Oct. 17. Kosny said he suspects the idea is floating around now because election candidates and front runners may want to appear \u201copen-minded.\u201d Toronto Mayor John Tory floated the idea at an event Thursday, pointing out that it would seem counterintuitive to allow people to smoke pot in parks but not drink a beer \u2014 especially since people are already bringing wine and beer to their picnics. In Ontario, for example, smoking or vaping in any workplace or enclosed public place is prohibited, with the punishment ranging from a $1,000 fine for the first offense to $5,000 for subsequent offenses. However, the ban doesn\u2019t extend to smoking or vaping in open-air public spaces. While the province of Ontario had traditionally banned drinking alcohol in public, the government\u2019s 2019 budget, launched in April 2019, introduced a new tailgating permit to allow public alcohol consumption at certain sporting events and introduced a measure that would allow cities within Ontario to designate public areas, such as parks, for alcohol consumption. By contrast, authorities in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, moved in 2018 to ban smoking on all public municipal properties such as roads and sidewalks, even in open air. As a further illustration of how complex the interaction of provincial and municipal authority in Canada is, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s provincial government introduced legislation in February 2019 that would prohibit public cannabis use but later reportedly resiled from those plans after the mayor and police chief in Montr\u00e9al declared the regulations would be unenforceable.",

Is this indicative of a potential shift in changing consumer preferences and the more widespread adoption of recreational cannabis as a substitute for alcohol products?  If so, what are the potential implications on the alcohol and marijuana markets?  People are drinking less beer in North America  First-quarter results out of two of North America\u2019s largest alcohol beverage makers show an alarming trend in what appears to be a slowdown in beer consumption in the Canadian and U.S. markets.  In the first quarter, Molson saw a 5.8% decline in sales to the United States along with a 2.5% drop-off in shipments to Canadian markets.  Meanwhile, AB Inbev, which owns the Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Corona brands, experienced a similar fate in its first quarter, reporting 2.3% softer sales than it experienced in the U.S. a year ago.  Granted, some of the weakness can probably be attributed to the growing popularity in recent years of \u201ccraft brews,\u201d often locally owned and operated breweries that are run on a much smaller and \u201cgrassroots level.\u201d But that theory, however, fails to account for what Molson referred to as a \u201csofter-than-anticipated start\u201d for the U.S. beer industry as a whole.  This leads one to believe that if North Americans as a whole are consuming less alcohol, is that because they\u2019re smoking more \u201cpot\u201d instead?  The case of marijuana as a substitute for alcohol  The best case that could be made to \u201cput down the pint and pick up the pipe\u201d would have to be the purported health benefits of marijuana.  Case in point being that even in advance of the drug becoming legal for recreational purposes, it is already being prescribed for a whole host of medical applications from treatment for multiple sclerosis to seizure disorders and Chron\u2019s disease.  Contrast that to alcohol, which carries with it all kinds of detrimental side effects, like cancers and liver disease, and given how health-conscious society is becoming, it\u2019s easy to see how people could be coerced to make the switch from alcohol to pot, or at the very least begin practicing a more \u201cbalanced\u201d approach to their recreational activities.  The implications for alcohol and marijuana stocks  Whether that story ends up playing out or not, there\u2019s reason to believe that it may be in the alcohol industry\u2019s best interests to get ahead of the curve, so to speak, and hedge their bets.  After all, it\u2019s estimated that by the beginning of the next decade, the market for cannabis products in Canada could be as large as the beer market today.  When you view this picture through the lens of management at companies like Molson Coors and AB Inbev then, you can see how making an investment in the marijuana industry might help them save their jobs in five or 10 years\u2019 time.  If you don\u2019t think this is a very real possibility, you needn\u2019t look any further than Constellation Brands, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:STZ) US$245 million investment in Canopy Growth Corp.(TSX:WEED) last year.  Bottom line  With legalization expected for later this year, M&A activity has already started to heat up in the sector.  That includes Aurora Cannabis Inc.\u2019s (TSX:ACB) purchase of CanniMed earlier this year for $1.23 billion, and, more recently, rumours that Aurora is in talks to acquire MedReleaf Corp. (TSX:LEAF).  But if the alcohol companies are going to act, they had better act fast.  The marijuana industry is expected to grow in excess of 20% annually through at least 2020, meaning that the price they\u2019ll have to pay for one of Canada\u2019s licensed pot growers will only get steeper from here.

According to a study from auto club giant AAA\u2019s safety foundation, a blood test threshold for THC \u2014 the chemical component of cannabis that makes people \u2018high\u2019 \u2014 is simply not scientifically possible. \nYet, in five of six states where cannabis is legal, the tests are used to determine whether or not drivers should be considered impaired. Those tests employ a blood level-based judgment similar to that used for determining alcohol impairment. But AAA found such tests for THC are wholly unreliable \u2014 sending potentially unimpaired drivers to jail and putting impaired drivers back behind the wheel. \n\u201cThere is understandably a strong desire by both lawmakers and the public to create legal limits for marijuana impairment in the same manner we do alcohol,\u201d said AAA president and CEO, Marshall Doney, as reported by the Associated Press . \u201cIn the case of marijuana this approach is flawed and not supported by scientific research.\u201d \nAfter discovering the tests had no value, the safety foundation recommended Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington simply ditch their THC impairment testing laws \u2014 and that other states considering similar laws abandon the proposed legislation. \nAs the study notes, determining actual impairment from THC consumption is quite different than for alcohol. Tolerance for the chemical would mean though a regular cannabis user might have high blood levels of THC, they are perfectly safe behind the wheel \u2014 while a relatively low THC blood level could be found in someone unfit to drive. \nInstead of what amounts to arbitrary blood testing, AAA recommends specialized law enforcement officers who would better observe behavior as a determination of impairment, which would then be backed up by THC blood testing. \nAs the AP noted, nine states \u2014 even some with legalized medicinal cannabis \u2014 currently have zero-tolerance policies in place for THC-impaired driving. Those states\u2019 laws include not only blood testing for THC, but also for its metabolites which can persist in blood long after the last use of cannabis. \nObviously, explained New York University professor and specialist in drug issues and criminal policy, Mark A. R. Kleiman, such laws make no sense. \n\u201cA law against driving with THC in your bloodstream is not a law you can know you are obeying except by never smoking marijuana or never driving,\u201d he explained. Kleiman, however, disagrees with AAA\u2019s recommendation to adjust current laws, and instead feels such offenses should by traffic violations. \nAccording to Kleiman, compared to other potentially dangerous impairments, cannabis is likely the least offensive on the list. While some studies showed roughly double the risk of accidents caused by cannabis impairment, nationally-legal hands-free cellphone usage quadruples the crash risk \u2014 and blood alcohol content of .12 increases accident risk 15-fold. \nA \u201cnoisy child in the back of the car\u201d presents the same increased dangers as driving under the influence of cannabis, Kleiman said \u2014 noting an exception would be use of both cannabis and alcohol together, which would greatly increase impairment. \nClearly, ineffectual and illegitimate laws that senselessly send people to jail need to be abandoned with a quickness \u2014 and the AAA safety foundation\u2019s findings on THC blood impairment testing would be a fantastic place to start. Share \nThis is really OLD news. They should have read this: http://www.bisdro.uni-bremen.de/boellinger/cannabis/09-robbe.pdf zimbo \ngood link, but older than this. the fact that interested people from along the whole world expect news in studies and decisions based on founded experiences to cannabis and society makes this \u201ckind of new\u201d : \u201cnow we know that we knew it before, but we didnt believe\u2026\u201d. all the studies in europe are hard work because of \u201cillegalitity\u201d. as only holland has a moderate view on that and a few countries like portugal or poland have anti criminal laws for owning a few gram, there is almost no way for good representative studies, except for medical science. thats why this 1994 study from holland is so important, and is translated in a big interpretation range along europe. The federal comission (same that was asked for 1ng level in 2002) tried to uplift the level to 3ng this january, due to later sciences, but was not succesful. relevant science of countries with \u201clegalisation\u201d is important for other countries, and such statements from the aaa too, as it comes from big brother u.s., thats always a door opener, holland science isn t so much for lobby germoney marianne \nIt\u2019s not about making sure people aren\u2019t impaired, it was never about that. It\u2019s just yet another means of trying to screw over anyone who breaks stupid prohibitionist drug laws. From that perspective, the law makes perfect sense. Michael \nThis is only a surprise for the people who have never experienced or used marijuana. 2 hours after you smoke it, you\u2019re as good as new most of the time. Sometimes it last a little longer but not very often especially if its mexican ditch weed. It has to be really good strain to last any longer than 2 hours. However, if you ingest it there is a longer buzz. It takes an hour or so after you ingest it to begin the buzz. \nAgain, marijuana is far far far more safe to use and understand how to use, than alcohol. If you wanna make your life better stop drinking alcohol which will definitely kill you and smoke a doobie, relax and enjoy the music knowing that what you just put in your body will NOT kill you.. marianne \nTo be fair, alcohol isn\u2019t all that deadly if used in moderation. Moderate consumption even has some health benefits. I mean it\u2019s certainly a drug with the potential to be very dangerous if misused, more so than most illegal drugs, but drinking alcohol won\u2019t definitely kill you (though it very well might if you overuse it). William Carmichael \n\u201cTo be fair, alcohol ISN\u2019T ALL THAT DEADLY if used in moderation.\u201d LOL! What a statement. marianne \nTrue enough, I did phrase that in a somewhat amusing way! Elizabeth Pallett \nOr you could try eating it to ensure good health, mental and physical, smoking has a very short term effect even for pain, ingesting has far more benefits and is better for you too. JD Salinger \nThe point of the article is getting tested for impairment. If you eat it you still have thc in your system. You can still get popped. The article says the tests are unreliable are unscientific. But thanks for your view on edibles anyway. mantirig41 \nI know I am a much kinder diver when stoned.

(for blood alcohol the level is 1,1). psychologists earn a lot of money with that. in switzerland, you may drive trolley car with up to 3ng/ml serum- as operator. both laws based on the 1994 limburg university study by h.w.j. robbe, also posted below. As there is no succesful way to criminalize people with a joint or a bit cannabis by criminal law in germany due to high \u201ccosts for nothing\u201d, the admin.law is misused, and you can loose your license even by smoking in a park or carrying 3 joints in a taxi. Finally i like the link to the noisy backseat kids. interesting: this year several people lost their lives getting involved in accidents by spontaneous street races. as the license is older than 2 years, the drivers get it back automatically after 1 -3 months. there is no significant statistic on marihuana caused accidents. in combination with alcohol there are. every known european study say that marihuana leads to defensive and careful appearances, while alcohol leads to aggresive and overestimational behaviour. beer is an huge economical factor here, followed by pharmaceutics, which are not further considered in such discussions. \non a tv documentation of german truckers they talk in every way about all kind of pharmaceutics taken before while and after their hard job\u2026 Misty Trenshaw \nhttp://sprout.news/cops-confess-people-drive-better-when-they-are-high/#wysija \nSo, what\u2019s the problem? You stop at a stop sign and wait for it to turn green? You\u2019re overly cautious? A good driver? It\u2019s all about government control. \nI divorced my parents because of control when I was 17.

Alcohol makes people drive faster & more recklessly. BarleySinger \nThe inability to account for \u201cTolerance\u201d isn\u2019t specific to cannabis. Is is true for nearly every intoxicant. It *very* true about alcohol. The cytochrome p450 system is different for every person. There is no simple roadside testing method in existence that can prove impairment.

In November, a $25,000 diamond ring reportedly flew from Beckham\u2019s finger while he was on the dance floor, never to be seen again. Sin City owner Gus Drakopoulos is pictured with Odell Beckham (left) and rapper 50 Cent (right) in undated photos. In 2012, a dispute between at the club between the entourages of Drake and Chris Brown later erupted into a brawl at a downtown dance spot that included shattered champagne bottles and tossed martini glasses. \nMeanwhile, former club employees say the joint often draws gang members and other troublemakers intent on settling beefs and brawling. \nKonstantine (Gus) Drakopoulos, who describes himself as the club\u2019s \u201cBossman,\u201d is a convicted white-collar felon. \nHe has employed an ex-con who did 10 years for manslaughter as a kind of intermediary with gang members to keep the peace, according to records and sources. \nThat man is now in prison for selling cocaine out of the club and carrying a loaded gun. Drakopoulos also had a retired NYPD inspector on the payroll . \nEven though it has been plagued by drug sales, gang activity, shootings, fights and allegations of prostitution, Sin City seems beyond the reach of cops, the State Liquor Authority, and local politicians. Community leaders see the fleshpot as coated in Teflon. \nAnd with good reason. \nDespite high-profile drug arrests at the club in June, the SLA renewed Sin City\u2019s license as it slogs on in its review, now in its eighth month. \nThe NYPD, meanwhile, quietly settled after suing to shutter the club for being a \u201cplace where individuals gather to engage in criminal activity.\u201d \nDrakopoulos, his lawyers, and a manager have denied wrongdoing, and say criticism of Sin City is unfair and misguided. They argue that it\u2019s a beacon of employment in the economically struggling South Bronx with an unparalleled security operation. \n\u201cAll we are is one of the largest employers in the South Bronx with over 100 employees who try to maintain good relationships with our local authorities and the community,\u201d Drakopoulos told the Daily News. \u201cYou can take that and twist it any way you like.\u201d \nA lawyer for Drakopoulos initially indicated interest in allowing The News to interview Drakopoulos more fully, but then backed away. \nEnter Sin City. CORSETS & COGNAC \nThe club inhabits a warehouse once used for car auctions in a heavily black and Hispanic neighborhood long afflicted by crime, unemployment, pollution, and high rates of asthma. \nCustomers line up under a ruby awning, next to a sign on the wall that reads \u201cno hats, hoodies, baggy jeans, sagging jeans, sweats.\u201d Sin City from the outside, after an August 2016 raid. (Gardiner Anderson for New York Daily News) \nPast the imposing doors, patrons pay $20 and go through metal detectors and across a large burgundy carpet to sit on red velvet banquets or black chairs around little tables under the glow of pink-purple lights and booming rap music. \nPatrons go to a booth to change large bills into singles taken from the office safe and piled in thick stacks. Ultimately, the singles find their way into strippers' G-strings. The club takes a cut of $1 out every $20 for the change-making service. \nA smoking room, which is barred under city ordinance, has often been available to customers, and until recently a bathroom attendant sold loose cigarettes as he handed out paper towels, State Liquor Authority transcripts show. A post shared by SinCityCabaret (@sincitycabaret) on Feb 5, 2017 at 5:46pm PST \nThe crowd is a mix of men in camo hoodies and backward caps and others who look like they had just sat for a GQ magazine shoot. \nThey munch on $19 pineapple shrimp and $28 T-bone steaks, drink $13 Hennessy Sweet Tea cocktails and can plunk down $2,200 for a Jeroboam of Krug Brut Cuvee or $4,000 for a bottle of Louis XIII de Remy Martin cognac. \nWomen in black and gold corsets with skin tight black shorts pour drinks behind the bar, as strippers gyrate on little stages or prowl the club looking for $20 \u201cplus a tip\u201d lap dances. \nSome dancers can make $1,000 to $2,000 a night, and the waitresses, or \u201cbottle girls,\u201d can take home $600 nightly, according to former employees who spoke with The News. \nThe dancers kick in $30 to $150 a night to work there, the former employees said. The interior of the Sin City Cabaret. (Norman Y. Lono for New York Daily News) \nNightly revenue for the club itself ranges from around $13,000 on a typical Tuesday to close to $60,000 on a Saturday night, according to internal records obtained by The News. Annually, the figures suggest that Sin City takes in roughly $11 million - not including what the dancers and waitresses make. ADVERTISEMENT \u2018THIS IS HEDONISM\u2019 \nIn a club awash in cash, five former employees \u2014 with a combined 20 years of Sin City experience \u2014 separately described a Wild West environment where just about anything could happen, where just about everyone hustled for money. \n\u201cThat place is hedonism,\u201d said one of the former workers. \u201cWhat goes down there is insane.\u201d A post shared by SinCityCabaret (@sincitycabaret) on Feb 5, 2017 at 7:51pm PST \nA former waitress says she started wound up at Sin City by responding to an ad in Craigslist. While already working a day job, her role at the club was to flirt and upsell customers on alcohol. On many nights, she ended up with $600 in wages and tips. \n\u201cYou get the hood, because you\u2019re in the Bronx,\u201d she said. \u201cWannabe rappers. But a lot of my customers were corporate guys. You had to have tough skin not just because you're working in a strip club but because of the harassment from some of the managers. A lot of times it was unprofessional.\u201d \nWhile she says she never let customers get too close to her, other women blurred the lines. \n\u201cI can't knock any of the women...it\u2019s what they have to do,\u201d she said. \u201cSome managers will stop it, and some won\u2019t.\u201d \nA former dancer said she started at the club at around 18. \u201cYou can make so much money in there, you kind of get lost in the money.\u201d \n\u201cA lot of people ask me why, but my back was against the wall,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to help take care of my family. You can make so much money in there, you kind of get lost in the money.\u201d \nAs for other dancers, she said: \u201cA lot of them had just come to America and needed money. Some girls just wanted to get high. Some girls had pimps.\u201d \nWhile the money was great, she said that she too suffered from harassment by some managers. In one incident, she said a manager grabbed her face when she rejected his advances. In another, she says a manager demanded she pay him bribes to continue dancing. \nShe said the stress of the constant harassment was tough on her: \u201cThe crazy thing is that I used to never ever drink. I started drinking at 22. One of my customers started me drinking. I was dancing sober for years. And it eventually became a problem I had to overcome.\" \nShe has since moved on from the life and has a new career. \n\u201cI\u2019ll probably never get married,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the dancer\u2019s curse.\u201d A HISTORY OF MELEES \nThe odor of marijuana was often strong in the club, a former employee said, but the bouncers frequently ignored it to avoid confrontations. \nThe bouncers had reason to be nervous. In 2011, bouncer James Britt was slashed by patrons while breaking up a fight, according to his lawsuit. \nHe needed staples in his head and stitches in his neck. A second bouncer, Wilfredo Delgado, was slashed on the nose in the same fight. Britt\u2019s lawsuit settled in 2015 for an undisclosed sum. \n\u201cGuards got about $110 a night, so it\u2019s not worth getting into a situation over weed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have like 600 people in there and 15 bouncers, and five of them are at the door. That\u2019s just not enough to control a crowd that size.\u201d \nHe said violence was so routine at times that it was only notable when someone got seriously hurt. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t safe to work there at all,\u201d said a former bouncer. \u201cThere was one time when a guy shot a gun outside the club, and he was later allowed to come back in.\u201d \nConsider what happened April 29 2015. A brawl erupted in the club just after 2 a.m., according to court records in a case brought by one of the combatants. \nWhen security tried to grab one of the men, he ripped free and waded, screaming, back into the fight. Another patron threw a chair into the melee. Dozens of customers ran outside to avoid the violence. \u201cThere was one time when a guy shot a gun outside the club, and he was later allowed to come back in.\u201d \nOn a different night, 20 gang members took on the bouncers and smashed a metal barricade through the front door, two former employees said. \nOn Christmas Day 2013, a drunk man blasted the front door with a gun after getting kicked out . \n\u201cI\u2019ve seen stabbings, shootings,\u201d a former employee said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people come out of the bathroom all cut up. I\u2019ve seen mobs destroy the place, the cops wouldn't come for half-an-hour and it never made the news. They would just send everyone home and lock the door.\u201d \nPatrons included members of the drug-dealing \u201cSex, Money Murda\u201d gang, which terrorized the Soundview section of the Bronx with violence for years, two former employees said. \n\u201cThey would start fights and I would ban them, and then they would be let back in, even though the bosses knew they were out of control,\u201d a former manager says. \nFrom Jan. 1, 2016 to Thursday, cops responded to 137 calls to the club for incidents ranging from possible crimes to fights to injured people, the NYPD said. ADVERTISEMENT TRAIL OF LAWSUITS \nSin City has had more than its day in court. \nA News review found at least 38 lawsuits against the club in state and federal court \u2014 including 20 filed by people allegedly beaten, shot or slashed by other patrons and four by people who claimed they were beaten by club security. \nTysheema Brown said she was at the club with two friends on May 6, 2016 at about 2 a.m. \nTwo women at an adjacent table glared at her, and then jumped her, punching her in the head, according to the police report. \u201cThey were beating her for five minutes and no one came over.\u201d \nOne of the women allegedly smashed Brown in the head with a hookah lamp. Cops arrested two women. \n\u201cThey were beating her for five minutes and no one came over,\u201d said Brown\u2019s lawyer, Laurence Savedoff. \u201cThese girls were creating trouble all night. There's a real lack of security there, and they let in questionable characters.\u201d The Sin City parking lot, where strippers and bouncers were arrested for cocaine sales July 2016. (Michael Schwartz for New York Daily News) \nBrown has sued for $15 million. The case is pending in Bronx Supreme Court. \nCamron Golphin alleged in a suit filed in Bronx Supreme Court that he was slashed in the face at a St. Patrick's Day party in 2015. \nHis lawyer, Michael Roitman of Frekhtman and Associates, said that the episode happened during a \u201cmidget boxing\u201d match in which the club set up a ring and brought in little people to fight. \nHe alleges Golphin was slashed in the culmination of events that included Sin City\u2019s serving a customer too much liquor and allowing the slasher to get a blade past metal detectors. \nThe club sued the man who slashed Golphin, and the case is still pending. \nNathan Medina filed a similar claim as a result of a fight in which he says he was slashed with a box cutter. His lawyer lawyer Gary Fish alleged that metal detectors weren't working that night, \n\u201cApparently, the man wasn't satisfied with the lap dance he got and he lashed out both metaphorically and physically,\u201d Fish said. The case is pending. \u201c...the man wasn't satisfied with the lap dance he got.\u201d \nAttorneys for the club have alleged in court papers that Medina was to blame for his injuries. The case is still pending. \nIn 2015, Samuel Thrower sued the club in Bronx Supreme Court for failing to provide adequate security, stemming from an incident in which a friend was mugged in a club bathroom and he was shot in the shoulder in the parking lot. The suit is pending. \nThe club denied any misconduct and asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed. \nSin City has also been hit with at least five employment-related court actions. \nIn 2010, six cocktail waitresses alleged a pattern of verbal and physical sexual harassment. \nIn one instance cited in the lawsuit, manager Kevin Wells allegedly stuck a dancer's foot in his mouth. Another plaintiff claimed Wells stuck his finger in her buttocks, and a third claimed he routinely squeezed her rear hard. \nThe plaintiffs also claimed they were denied overtime and tips. \nWhile a Sin City lawyer disputed the charges at the time, the Manhattan Federal Court case was settled in 2011 for approximately $150,000, according to court records and a source familiar with the case. \nWells left the club after the suit was filed \u2014 but the club posted a picture of him Monday on Instagram, writing, \u201cHe\u2019s back. Kevin has returned!\u201d \nDrakopoulos\u2019 lawyer Harvey Slovis denied that Wells had been rehired, and said the number of lawsuits against the club was small. \n\u201cYour lawsuit stuff is a joke,\u201d Slovis said in an email to The News. \u201cYou are talking about 15 years of activity and the only lawsuit I know about is one of workers compensation. This place is the least violent of clubs in this city and I have represented many. You are passing over the elephant to squash an ant.\u201d THE \u2018BOSSMAN\u2019 \nKonstantine (Gus) Drakopoulos, 40, the man who presides over Sin City, grew up in Astoria and built his little South Bronx empire with two associates: Lampros Moumouris, a Texas strip club owner, and Kyriacos Mavros, a Florida real estate entrepreneur. Former workers confirmed their roles. Their names were on incorporation records. Constantine \u201cGus\u201d Drakopoulos. \nDrakopoulos, who refers to himself as a \u201cnightlife impresario, entrepreneur and aviation pilot,\u201d has done well. Last year he bought a 5,000-square-foot five-bedroom mansion for $850,000 in Peconic on Long Island\u2019s North Fork. The house had been advertised as a \u201cgentleman\u2019s estate home.\u201d \nBoisterous and emotional, Drakopoulos holds court at the club with rappers and other entertainers \u2014 and he allegedly profits despite the fact that he\u2019s not on the liquor license, which would likely be a violation of state law. \nAs of Thursday, Drakopoulos was listed on the state incorporation papers of the club\u2019s parent company, SCE Group. \nBut his mother\u2019s name \u2014 Stavroula Drakopoulos \u2014 is on the liquor license, along with those of Moumouris and Mavros. Gus Drakopoulos' five-bedroom mansion in Peconic, New York. (David Wexler for New York Daily News) \nThat may be because, around the time Sin City opened in 2002, Drakopoulos pleaded guilty to securities fraud in Brooklyn Federal Court for illegally trading stock on inside information about a merger involving a frozen turkey processing company. Moumouris was a co-defendant. \nAlthough such a conviction would bar Drakopoulos from owning Sin City, he has left no doubt on social media as to who runs the show: \nHe used the Instagram handle \u201cGusBossMan,\u201d and has loaded his account with photos of himself with celebrities and dancers. A screenshot of Gus Drakopoulos' Instagram profile as it existed Dec. 2016. \nOn Nov. 8, Sin City posted on Instagram about a party for Gus at the club, referring to him as the top guy. \n\u201cDefinitely our biggest party of the year. @gusbossman 40th birthday party. VIP and celebrities coming to celebrate with the boss man himself. Gus!\u201d \nAlthough Drakopoulos often pals around with black celebrities at Sin City, a lawsuit indicates and former employees say he has repeatedly made racist remarks. \nIn 2014, dancers Kieara Gaskin, Tenia Stuckey and Denise Miller sued Sin City, alleging that Drakopoulos used the n-word and said things like, \u201cWe don\u2019t want the ghetto element you attract.\u201d \nThey claimed Drakopoulos and manager Kevin Wells called African-Americans \u201cb s, hos and sluts,\u201d according to the suit. \nThe dancers also alleged that women with darker skin were generally not hired, and if they were hired, they would be relegated to less lucrative day shifts, when Drakopoulos was not there. The roster of female employees at Sin City in the Bronx is shown in this undated photo. (BEVAN PORTER / ORIGINALGOGETTERS) \nAdditionally, they claimed they were forced to pay arbitrary fines. Gaskin, for example, asserted that she had to pay $500 to Wells to return to work after leaving for a period. \nFinally, they claimed that managers slapped, grabbed or poked their privates. A lawyer for the club denied the allegations at the time. The Manhattan Federal Court case settled in June for an undisclosed amount. Neither Gaskin nor Stuckey, would comment for this article. \nIn a 2013 text message obtained by The News, Drakopoulos sent a fake Christmas card showing a black man in prison garb behind security glass with a black woman talking to him over a prison phone. \nThe caption read: \u201cMerry Christmas from the Johnsons!\u201d \nIn a 2014 text, Drakopoulos sent a picture of two black men dressed in black clothes and backwards baseball caps to a manager and wrote, \u201cU need to speak front door about being (sic) more selective at door.\u201d \nSaid a former dancer: \u201cGus would come to the back and say things like \u2018I got these n s coming and fighting in my club,\u2019 but whenever a black celebrity would come to the club it was all good.\u201d \nSlovis, Drakopoulos\u2019 lawyer, sent The News a current picture of the club\u2019s dancers which shows a significant number of African-American women. \n\u201cAs you can see, the roster has a lot of black girls,\u201d Slovis said in a text message. \u201cYou telling me Gus is a racist is pretty funny. 75% of the girls (are) black and Hispanic.\u201d \nDrakopoulos also engaged in a tryst with a dancer, according to a video viewed by The News. \nRecorded on a club security camera on Nov. 24, 2012, the video shows an undressed woman performing two sexual acts on Drakopoulos as he sits on a couch in his office. \nThe woman\u2019s identity is being withheld by The News. \nAsked about the video, Drakopoulos first asked in a brief interview, \u201cWhy is this relevant?\u201d and then added, \u201cI\u2019m a family man.\u201d \nLater, he issued this denial: \u201cI do not engage in any sexual activity with any of my employees.\u201d \u2018TERROR ZONE\u2019 \nSin City has been a major frustration for members of Bronx Community Board 1. \nDistrict manager Cedric Loftin said the club has generated dozens of complaints about violence and illegal activities and that the board has sent a half-dozen letters asking the State Liquor Authority to shut the club. \n\"We get complaints about violent activities that spill out into the local commercial community, and also illicit behavior,\" Loftin said. \"We feel that their license needs to be violated and they need to be shut down but our complaints have fallen on deaf ears.\" \nBronx Borough President Ruben Diaz has also called for closure . \u201cSin City has not been a good neighbor to The Bronx.\u201d \n\"Sin City has not been a good neighbor to The Bronx, and my position has not changed: this establishment is a nuisance, and it should have its liquor license revoked,\" Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. said. \nIn a 2013 letter, the community board cited 61 reports of dangerous activity stemming from the club, called Sin City a \u201cterror zone\u201d and noted that its liquor license had lapsed. \nRegardless, the SLA renewed Sin City\u2019s license. \nThe board last sent a letter to the authority in December, citing violence, emergency responses by the FDNY and \u201cactive\u201d drug trafficking \u201csince its inception and over its last liquor license renewal two years ago.\u201d \nAgain, regardless, the SLA renewed Sin City\u2019s license \u2014 without notifying the board. \nWhile Loftin and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. have called for the club to be shutdown, the other pols who represent the neighborhood have been silent. \nCity Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, State Sen. Jose Serrano and state Assemblywoman Maria Del Carmen Arroyo did not respond to requests for comment. UNDERCOVER 141 \nIn 2014, NYPD detectives opened an investigation into allegations of drug dealing in the club. Cocaine sold to an undercover officer inside the Sin City Cabaret, which led to the indictment and arrest of nine individuals in connection with the club. (NYPD) \nOver the next 17 months, four undercovers made repeated cocaine buys from dancers and bouncers, court records show. \nIn a recent SLA hearing, one of those detectives, identified as Undercover 141, took the stand hidden behind a screen and told of her nights buying drugs among the red velvet booths. \nShe testified that she had only to walk across the burgundy carpet to a stripper or a bouncer and ask if they had any cocaine, a transcript of her testimony shows. \nAs dancers moved their bodies and music boomed, she secured powdered cocaine wrapped in a dollar bill or secreted in a match box emblazoned with the Sin City logo. \n\u201cOther people can still see you, security guards there can see you, other people going by,\u201d she said, adding of a stripper: \u201cI asked her if she could get some for me in the future. She said \u2018yes\u2019 and I only had to let her know ahead of time.\u201d \nThe detective also testified to the existence of the illegal smoking room, and a bathroom attendant who sold loose cigarettes. \nSLA associate counsel Margarita Marsico called the club\u2019s smoking room a \u201cwalking health code violation.\u201d \nIn June, the NYPD arrested nine strippers and bouncers for allegedly dealing cocaine .

Padilla and Estevez, identified as a Sin City dancers, were two of nine people indicted in connection with the sale of drugs at Sin City. (Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News) HE\u2019S \u2018TROUBLE\u2019 \nAmong those busted was Charles Percell, a convicted felon also known as \u201cTrouble.\u201d \nIn the drug case, Percell, 47, was identified as a Sin City bouncer, but former employees described him as both a bodyguard and as an intermediary between the club and gang members. \u201cYou get a wolf to deal with the wolves.\u201d \n\u201cHe was a buffer between the club and gangs,\u201d a former employee said. \u201cThe projects are only a few blocks from the club and that's where he grew up. He had a way to talk with them. You get a wolf to deal with the wolves.\u201d \nIn addition to prior robbery and drug arrests, Percell was convicted of manslaughter in 1991 and was sentenced to six to 18 years, records show. He was released in 2001. \nIn February 2012, while working at the club, he was convicted of aggravated drunk driving \u2014 and still wasn\u2019t done with breaking the law. \nIn November 2015, cops busted Percell for carrying a loaded .40-caliber Glock. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was then rearrested for selling cocaine in Sin City, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison. \nIn addition to netting Percell, the undercover investigation has secured three guilty pleas from a bouncer, a dancer and a woman who was dating a dancer. Five other cases are pending. \nIn an impassioned defense of the club posted in August on the Observer's website, Sin City manager Frank Aleman slammed the NYPD probe, writing: \n\u201cFour cops had to come into Sin City including on holidays, watch topless dancers all to allegedly buy a few grams of cocaine, and as a result of something management knew nothing about, there will be scores of people on the unemployment line.\u201d \nAleman went on to claim the club has the \u201cstrongest security in the business.\u201d He ended his letter with the slogan: \u201cNo justice, no jobs, no boobs, no fair.\u201d CLOSING TIME \nFollowing the June arrests, the State Liquor Authority filed 18 safety code violations against the club in an effort to shut it down \u2014 charges strongly denied by the club\u2019s lawyer. The agency also filed charges based on assaults and noise complaints, a spokesman said. \nPart of the SLA investigation has been looking at whether management knew about the drug dealing. \nAt the same time, the NYPD filed a lawsuit aimed at shutting the club under nuisance abatement laws that empower the city the power to close places used for illegal activities. \nEight months later, little has changed. The SLA has held a series of hearings, but the club hasn\u2019t been shuttered once. \nOn a recent Friday, about 40 patrons sat at tables drinking and ogling the women. \nAt one point, the DJ yelled, \u201cThere we go ... Show me some t s baby!\u201d A dancer named \u201cDior\u201d encouraged a patron to touch her butt and he put dollars into her G-string and slapped her rear. \nAlthough SLA officials insist they are taking the case seriously, the agency knew three years ago that Drakopoulos appeared to run the club and to profit without his name on the liquor license. \nThe SLA finally charged him with a violation known as \u201cavailing\u201d in late December. \nThe SLA subpoenaed the bank account statements and wire transfers to see whether Drakopoulos had an undisclosed interest in the club. \n\u201cThe SLA charged Sin City with availing their license to Konstantine Drakopoulos after finding evidence that the licensee is allowing Mr. Drakopoulos, a person not licensed by the SLA, to operate and profit from the business,\u201d SLA spokesman William Crowley said. \nAround the time the SLA acted, Drakopoulos pulled down his \u201cGus Bossman\u201d Instagram page, and Sin City posted that Moumouris was the new \u201cbossman.\u201d \nSin City lawyer Martin Mehler has argued that the club had no idea about drug dealing, and that the strippers and bouncers were not employees, but contract workers who float from club to club. He also argued that the club had more than adequate security. \n\u201cI can show you beyond a shadow of a doubt that it (the drug dealing) wasn\u2019t permitted by this licensee,\u201d he told the SLA board in a hearing. \u201cBecause these people tried more times than not to get these drugs and couldn't get them inside my place.\u201d \nIn an interview, Mehler said he believes the charges are meritless, stating that Drakopoulos is only a Sin City employee. \n\u201cHe\u2019s not a principal of the premises,\u201d Mehler said. \u201cNo one ever said he wasn\u2019t managing it.\u201d \nSlovis said, \u201cIt is absolutely untrue that Gus owns that club. He manages it and I know the owners.\u201d NYPD BLUES \nLast September, even as the NYPD and the State Liquor Authority investigated Sin City, cops posed for photographs with the strip club\u2019s employees at a charity softball game. \nDrakopoulos immediately posted photos of the employees, clad in skin-tight T-shirts, grinning and posing with the cops in NYPD shirts and hats at the event. Sin City employees are pictured with members of the NYPD after a softball game. (Obtained by News) \nThe relationship between cops and the strip club has been of many shades. \nDeputy Inspector Brian Hennessy, the 40th Precinct commander, has complained in public meetings that violence at the club draws cops from other duties. The NYPD would not make him available for an interview. \nFor years, though, Drakopoulos has employed retired NYPD Inspector James Alles, who commanded the 45th and 52nd precincts, as his security director . \nThe News previously reported allegations that Alles\u2019 job was in part to convince police commanders to downplay or not report incidents in and around the club. \nThe 2013 incident in which someone fired bullets into the club door was never conveyed to the SLA, The News reported. \n\u201cAlles advised the club how to handle the police,\u201d former manager Mike Diaz said in July. \u201cIf the cops needed an explanation on something, he would give them an explanation.\u201d \nThe News has since learned that the city Department of Investigation has opened a probe into those allegations. \nA DOI spokeswoman said, \u201cDOI is aware of the matter and declines further comment.\u201d \nMehler, the club\u2019s lawyer, said he wasn\u2019t aware of a DOI probe. \nIn the nuisance abatement lawsuit, NYPD lawyer Antony Anisman argued that the club needed to be closed because it was a \u201cserious public nuisance.\u201d \n\u201cFor well over a year, the premises has been a location where individuals gather to engage in criminal activity,\u201d Anisman wrote. \nIn its press release on the drug case, federal prosecutors wrote that the nuisance abatement case was triggered \u201cin response to persistent criminal activity inside and around the club, including acts of violence.\u201d \nBut then, the NYPD agreed in November to drop the case in exchange for a $100,000 fine \u2014 in $30,000 increments spread over three months \u2014 and the right to conduct unannounced inspections. \nThe NYPD could already conduct unannounced inspections of a business with a liquor license. The searches were included in the settlement to remind the club of that fact, a police official said in a statement, adding: \u201cThe settlement allows for the business to continue to operate and for law enforcement to ensure that criminal activity is not being conducted at the location.\u201d \nAs for that softball game, an NYPD spokesman said it was between the NYPD and Def Jam Records, not the strip club. \n\u201cThe NYPD did not play Sin City in softball,\u201d the spokesman said.

The autistic woman says she was raped by between five and 12 men a night (picture posed by models) (Photo: Getty) \nAfter struggling to make friends at school, she says she loved having someone who would talk to her, listen to her and let her borrow his things. \nTom would come over to her house and have a cup of tea with her mum before going upstairs and sitting on her bed, listening to her. \nHowever, one day, he came into her room and kissed her, Taylor says. \nBefore long, they were apparently regularly sitting together under a blanket in the living room, with Tom touching her intimately. \n\"I believed that we were 'in a relationship',\" Taylor writes in her book. \nShe adds: \"I was prepared to do whatever would make Tom happy, for his own sake and so that I didn't lose my only friend.\" \nEventually, she says she was raped by Tom in her mum's bed - abuse that left her feeling like she had done \"something wrong\". \nAt the time, she was only 11 and living in a ferry port town in the UK. \n\"I didn't know what he was doing when he turned me over and lay on top of me,\" she writes. \"I had read enough about sex by that time to have a vague idea of what was involved, and I was pretty sure he hadn't put his penis where it was supposed to go.\" \nShe goes on to describe how, each time he had abused her, Tom would suddenly stop and go into the bathroom. He would then leave, in silence. \n\"Looking back on it now, I realise that he probably felt guilty and ashamed of what he was doing,\" she explains in her book. \nSpeaking to Mirror Online, Taylor adds that she \"didn't like\" Tom when she first met him. \nHowever, she says that he began coming round, cooking for her and letting her borrow his possessions - which meant a lot to her. \n\"It was the little things,\" she says, adding that how she felt about Tom's behaviour linked back to \"not having much as a child\". \nReferring to the later incidents in her mum's bedroom, she describes how the married man \"wouldn't talk to me after doing certain things\". \n\"I thought I'd done something wrong,\" she says. \"On the media, I'd see a couple sleep together then always cuddle up and have a cup of tea.\" \nAs a youngster, Taylor lived in a \"doss-house\" with her mother, where she was surrounded by \"weed-smoking\" adults, drug addicts and alcoholics. \nShe says she never knew her dad, while her mum often told her she was \"retarded\". \nShe was eventually diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. \nShe describes how she became so confused and lonely that she would have \"done almost anything\" to feel her mum loved her, or that she had a friend. \n\"I had a very blinkered childhood,\" Taylor tells Mirror Online. \n\"I didn't really have many other children around me to compare it to.\" \nShe says she realised her childhood was different from others' after starting school. \n\"When I started going to school. I'd say how many people we had staying at my mum's house... It made me start realising,\" she says. \nShe adds that, as a young girl, she would turn things into a \"monetary measure\". \nShe would notice that other children had new shoes, or had just been on holiday, and would ask her mum why she didn't have the \"latest things\". \nDuring her childhood, Taylor found a man dead from an overdose at her home and helped her stepbrothers to shoplift, according to her book. \n\"I was just five,\" she tells Mirror Online. \"We'd go out altogether. This is before the days of CCTV. I would go up to the counter and talk to the shop assistant. \n\"I would say I was looking for a present for my mum. I had a script telling me what to do. I would then change my mind and go out the shop.\" \nShe says her stepbrothers would steal products such as razors, perfume and DVDs. \nSeven years on, aged 12, Taylor got to know Nadeer, an 18-year-old from Asia who worked in a local fast food shop and she often saw \"around\". \n\"He was always outside the shop and would strike up a conversation,\" she says. Taylor is now a 22-year-old university student, with a young child \nFor their first date, the pair went on a drive and Naseer told Taylor he wanted to have sex with her. However, she was on her period so she refused. \n\"Afterwards, he told his friends and everyone at the park that I wasn't a girl at all and for a while they all made fun of me,\" she says. \nNaseer, who had aggressive and drug-dealing friends, would deliberately humiliate Taylor, according to her book, published by Harper Element. \nHe and his friends would call her a 'retard' and offer her cans of beer filled with cigarette butts - as she discovered after drinking them. \nThey would also hide her shoes and open the door when she was on the toilet. \nTaylor says she was still seeing Naseer when she started dating a 17-year-old boy called Karim, who was studying at a UK college. \nShe says he stood up for her when other people teased her, so when they slept together, she decided to tell her mum she had had sex with someone. \nThen aged 12, she was four years below the age of consent. \nIn her book, she says her mum replied: \"Aaaah, my little girl's all grown-up at last.\" \n\"The reaction was very bizarre,\" admits Taylor, describing how her mother then took her to the GP to get the contraceptive pill. \n\"The doctor was quite worried to say the least,\" she tells Mirror Online. \"That was another hint that this wasn't normal. \n\"The doctor was asking, 'is it because of your daughter's periods?\" \nShe says, despite the doctor's concerns, she and her mum left the surgery with contraception. However, she didn't ever take the pills. \nIn her book, Taylor describes how she started going to Naseer's friend Saleem's flat, where they'd play Grand Theft Auto together. \nShe also attended parties with the 25-year-old, where on one occasion, a huge man tried to rape her in the bathroom. \nShe says Saleem would \"test\" her to see if she could keep a secret and, before long, she was being raped by both him and his friends. \n\"That's when the truth finally dawned on me,\" she writes in her book. \n\"I hadn't been invited to the parties because I was Saleem's girlfriend, or even part of the group: I was at his flat to work.\" \nStill aged 12, Taylor fell pregnant for the first time. She says after Saleem found out, he got her so drunk on vodka that she blacked out and started bleeding. \nIt was shortly after this that, after arriving at Saleem's flat, Naseer told her to come with him to a house to see \"some boys\". \nThe next day, she returned to the house to find a queue already forming on the stairs. \nFrom then on for around six months, every night was the same horrific ordeal. \nShe was given alcohol, before being sent to the bedroom. There, she would swig from a bottle of vodka every time one of her rapists left the room. \nShe would use wet wipes and tissues to clean herself up. In her book, she estimates she was forced to sleep with between five and twelve people a night. \nBecause many of the men had come to the country via refugee camps abroad, she says they didn't have much money to pay for the sex with her. \nTherefore, the \"currency\" was a bag of weed, a bottle of vodka or a \"favour\". \n\"I disassociated a lot from that whole time period,\" she tells Mirror Online. \n\"I don't have many memories of it. I was always drinking quite heavily. It was a role I had to fit into. I would see it as 'it's time to go to work'.\" \nBefore she turned 13, Taylor fell pregnant again, losing the baby when another man pushed her down the stairs when she refused to sleep with him. \nAt this time, as well as regularly drinking, she had \"opted out\" of going to school. \nShe had a laptop that she was supposed to be using for home schooling. \nEventually, Taylor says she grew up from being a \"naive little girl\" and became aggressive, with pimps no longer able to trust her to stay quiet. \nShe became less popular and, aged 14, a 21-year-old man she had befriended persuaded her to go back to school, she writes in her book. \nAged 16, she became engaged to a man called Baashir and at 17, she fell pregnant. \n\"For the first few months it didn't feel quite real,\" Taylor tells Mirror Online. \nShortly before her and Baashir's wedding, however, she started suffering from mental health issues, which would see her \"switch\" and become aggressive. \nShe eventually gave birth to their child. \nBut she suffered post-natal depression, while her husband was allegedly stealing money from her to buy drugs like cocaine. \nHe would also strangle her, leading their child to try to strangle another kid at nursery after witnessing the attack, Taylor reveals. \nShe says, after this, she started fighting back. \nDetermined to build a safe future for herself and her offspring, she saw a counsellor - who made her realise what she had suffered was abuse - and went to college. \nToday, she has moved away from her mum's house and is studying at university. \nShe lives with her child, although she says she remains fearful social services could take them away after a previous experience with a social worker. \nShe says the worker said something about removing the youngster from her care after she complained about domestic violence - which is no longer a part of her life. \nNow, she says she has a loving partner who has helped her to move on. Meanwhile, she loves and cares for her child every day. \nAfter splitting with Baashir, Taylor alerted the police to a violent attack he carried out on her and social services visited her home. \nHowever, she didn't take any further action, believing the police involvement would have already served as warning to her ex-partner. \nWhen asked whether she would consider going to the police about men who previously abused her, she told Mirror Online: \"I'm not totally opposed to it. \n\"I wouldn't do it for my own sake, it would stir up other memories.\" \nTaylor says, however, that she would likely contact officers and tell them about her past if she \"had reason to worry about anyone else\". \nDespite what she's been through, the young woman says she doesn't feel angry for how her mum acted towards her. \nShe says she just \"feels sorry\" for her. \n\"I stopped contacting her for a little while and then got back in touch,\" she says. \n\"She's really good with my child.\" \nTaylor, who is on a waiting list for therapy, wants her offspring to have a completely different childhood from the one she had. \nWhen asked whether she'll tell her child about her experiences, she replied: \"I was wondering that myself the other day. I'm not sure about that yet.\" \nShe also says that, although she used to think the abuse was \"OK because I went there willingly in a weird manner\", she now understands it was not. \nShe says she hopes that telling her shocking story will help other people to realise that \"what is done to you isn't what you are.\" \n\"A grown man shouldn't be interested in a 12-year-old,\" she says. \nAuthor Jane Smith, who helped to tell Taylor's story, tells Mirror Online that it was a \"very difficult one to write\" because it was so \"distressing\". \n\"Taylor was someone I instantly liked. I couldn\u2019t imagine what she went through. It was hard to hear it, \"she says. \n\"She's very clever. But because of her Aspegers, as a child, she couldn\u2019t understand what was going on around her. \n\"She\u2019s had to teach herself what people mean.\u201d \nJane says she believes there are, \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d, other people across the country who are in the same situation that Taylor was. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the story of a lot of people,\" she says. \n\u201cA lot of young people are abused in this way. They may not realise it themselves, they\u2019re just looking for affection,\" she says. \nShe adds: \"The abuse needs to be stopped at root. \n\"How can people do that to a little girl?\" I Know What You Are by Taylor Edison and Jane Smith is published by Harper Element (\u00a37.99).

                              "text": "Mouthwash has the potential to protect against COVID-19 infection by killing the coronavirus before it can infect human cells, according to a new report. Coronaviruses belong to the class of 'enveloped viruses', meaning they are covered by a fatty layer that is vulnerable to certain chemicals. A team of international researchers say mouthwash could destroy the outermost layer or 'envelope' of the virus, preventing its replication in the mouth and throat. The scientists say there is an urgent need to test the effectiveness of mouthwash in trials, although there is currently no clinical evidence that it would be successful. The World Health Organisation has already said: 'There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.' The study authors do not say that current commercially-available mouthwash prevents COVID-19, but that further research into mouthwash chemicals could be beneficial. Readily available dental mouthwashes have the potential to destroy the lipid envelope of coronaviruses, combating virus replication in the mouth and throat Writing in Function, the study authors, led by Cardiff University, say oral rinses are an \ufffd?under-researched area of major clinical need\u2019. The team is backed by virologists, lipid specialists and healthcare experts from Cardiff University\u2019s School of Medicine, along with the universities of Nottingham, Colorado, Ottawa, Barcelona and Cambridge\u2019s Babraham Institute. 'Safe use of mouthwash \u2013 as in gargling \u2013 has so far not been considered by public health bodies in the UK,' said lead author Professor O\u2019Donnell, co-director of Cardiff University\u2019s Systems Immunity Research Institute. 'In test tube experiments and limited clinical studies, some mouthwashes contain enough of known virucidal ingredients to effectively target lipids in similar enveloped viruses. 'What we don\u2019t know yet is whether existing mouthwashes are active against the lipid membrane of SARS-CoV-2. 'Our review of the literature suggests that research is needed as a matter of urgency to determine its potential for use against this new virus.' 'This is an under-researched area of major clinical need \u2013 and we hope that research projects will be quickly mobilised to further evaluate this.' Coronavirus is a type of enveloped virus, meaning it has an outer lipid membrane that could be damaged by chemicals in mouthwash. Naked viruses lack the viral envelope The ingredients of dental mouthwashes, including chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine, all have the potential to prevent infection and several \ufffd?deserve clinical evaluation\u2019, according to the researchers. In particular, these chemicals disrupt the outer lipid membrane, known as the \ufffd?viral envelope\u2019 or \ufffd?lipid envelope\u2019 of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The lipid envelope helps several viruses, including coronaviruses, bind to human cells while avoiding the host immune system. Specific spike proteins called \ufffd?glycoproteins\u2019 on the surface of the envelope identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's cell membrane, which allows infection. Mouthwash chemicals could potentially modify the ability of the spike glycoproteins to interact with receptors on host cells. The researchers said there had so far been 'no discussion' about the potential role of damaging the fatty membrane as a possible way to inactivate the virus. The lipid envelope does not change when viruses mutate, meaning mouthwash could still work against any new coronavirus strains that emerge from this pandemic. The WHO has previously debunked the suggestion that mouthwash can prevent infection by SARS CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. 'Some brands of mousthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth,' it said. 'However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV infection.' WHO has emphatically debunked the theory that gargling mouthwash can prevent infection by the coronavirus Research in this area appears to be largely unexplored \u2013 Listerine, one of the biggest mouthwash brands, says on its website that none of its products have been tested against any strains of coronavirus. 'Listerine mouthwash is not intended to be used, nor would it be beneficial as a hand sanitizer or surface disinfectant,' it says. Common mouthwashes contain the same key ingredient as coronavirus-killing hand santiser \u2013 alcohol. However, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US's public health authority, recommends a hand sanitiser that contains at least 60 per cent alcohol for effective protection, and Listerine's products consist of only around 20 per cent alcohol. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also stresses that drinking pure alcohol, along with methanol or bleach, is incredibly dangerous. These substances do not prevent or cure COVID-19 and can lead to disability and death. 'Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces \u2013 however you should never drink them,' WHO says on its website. 'They will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs.'",

                              "text": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: Why is COVID-19 so harmful to the lungs? Are smokers more at risk of the virus causing damage? As a smoker, should I be taking more precautions than the average person? ANSWER: COVID-19 can significantly affect the lungs. People whose lung health is affected by factors such as lung disease or smoking tend to be at higher risk for more severe symptoms from COVID-19. You can reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 by practicing infection prevention techniques and carefully following other guidelines for slowing the spread of the illness. COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness that is caused by a virus. It can trigger symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Symptoms range widely, from very mild to severe. For those whose symptoms are more severe, the illness often leads to pneumonia \u2014 an infection that inflames the air sacs in the lungs. Pneumonia may require hospitalization and use of a breathing machine, or ventilator. In some cases, breathing difficulty coupled with pneumonia makes COVID-19 life-threatening. Poor lung health appears to play a role in deaths related to COVID-19. Although smoking isn't the only factor that influences lung health, it does have a considerable effect. Researchers believe that smoking makes people more susceptible to the infection that causes COVID-19 and its complications because smoking damages the body's natural defenses against some bacteria and viruses. Data from China show the fatality rate from COVID-19 in that country overall stands at slightly above 2%. For people who had lung disease prior to the infection, that rate is much higher at 6%. Other underlying medical conditions make a difference, too. For people with cardiovascular disease who developed COVID-19 in China, the fatality rate was more than 10%. For those with diabetes, it was 7%, and in people who had high blood pressure, 6%. In addition, the older people were, the higher their risk of severe illness. So the fact that you're a smoker increases your risk of developing more severe symptoms if you contract COVID-19. But other factors also play a role in that risk, including your age and any underlying health concerns. Whether you smoke or not, there are concrete steps that you can take to protect yourself from the virus. Always cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue or the crook of your arm, and then wash your hands. Don't touch your face until you've washed your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. Wash your hands frequently. If you don't have soap and water, use a hand sanitizer that's at least 60% alcohol. Stay home if you're sick, and insist that others in your household do the same. Reduce face-to-face interaction with anyone who might be ill. Disinfect common surfaces regularly. It's also important to get your annual flu vaccine and check whether you have received pneumococcal vaccine. Because COVID-19 and influenza have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to differentiate between the two. When you get a flu vaccine, you greatly decrease your risk of being infected with the flu. If you develop COVID-19 symptoms, that makes it easier for your care team to determine the source of those symptoms. Finally, follow the guidelines in your area for social distancing \u2014 putting space between yourself and others to reduce the spread of illness \u2014 such as avoiding large gatherings and keeping contact with others in public spaces to a minimum. Preventing COVID-19 is crucial because no antiviral medications or vaccines are available for this illness at this time. Instead, treatment focuses on controlling symptoms. Any claims that a medication, herbal supplement or other substance can effectively treat or cure COVID-19 are bogus. As you consider ways to stay healthy, keep in mind that the COVID-19 pandemic is changing quickly. Stay informed and get your information from reliable sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and Mayo Clinic. \u2014 Dr. Gregory Poland, Vaccine Research Group, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota _______________________________________________ Check the CDC website for additional updates on COVID-19.

Without mentioning that our satire was a hyperbolic buildup on his own recent writings, Zakaria cries for government protection of his hurt feelings, making it clear that he can dish it out but can't take it. Taste your own medicine, Fareed.\"Progressives\" have trolled, ridiculed, satirized, maligned, insulted, bullied, and lied about conservatives since the inception of the Internet. But once they see the signs of oncoming traffic, they cry and run to mommy - or to the nanny state in this case - asking to make it a one-way street once again, where only they can ride their tricycles, wear funny hats, and fling poop at those whom they consider inferiors. Watch Fareed Zakaria on camera wiping his face from the poop flung at him. An open letter to Fareed Zakaria from The People's Cube ~ Dear Fareed,There have been studies showing that a foreign-born author's unique perspective can help the natives to boost their own creative thinking through the so-called \"schema violation,\" which occurs when our world is turned upside-down. You may argue that your \"otherness\" benefits and enlightens this country, with an implication that those unwilling to be enlightened by you are bigots who resent your \"otherness\" and won't have their old schema to be violated by a newcomer. Like you, I am a foreign-born author whose English is a second, or, rather, a third language; I know what it feels to be \"the other.\" I also like to help the natives to boost their creative thinking by turning their reality upside-down and sending their temporal and spatial cues off-kilter (my website, The People's Cube , is one such big schema violation). I don't resent anyone's \"otherness\" as long as they don't attempt to make me comply to theirs. In sum, I am not concerned with your ethnic or cultural \"otherness.\" It is your ideological \"otherness\" that bothers me, which makes you indistinguishable from the next run-of-the-mill, native-born \"progressive.\"Now that we got the implication of bigotry out of the way, let's get down to business.On January 2, one of our contributors posted a satirical response to your Washington Post article where you apparently gloated over the premature deaths of white males in America. Our author took your argument to its logical conclusion, adding the need to exterminate white females as well - through Jihad, rape, and sex slavery as recently seen in Europe and elsewhere. This parody wasn't meant to be taken as factual reporting, given the context of our website and especially considering the author's credentials at the top: Chedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth.On January 14, you responded to our satire in your Washington Post article titled, Bile, venom and lies: How I was trolled on the Internet , and today you started your show on CNN with a segment titled, Fareed's Take: I was the target of Internet trolling , in which you were mostly reading your earlier article from the teleprompter. Among other things you claimed that our story \"was cleverly written to provide conspiracy theorists with enough ammunition to ignore evidence\" and complained that some people took our \"reporting\" seriously and reposted it in social media with impolite comments, all of which led you to conclude that someone must create a mechanism in social media \"to distinguish between fact and falsehood.\" And since that someone can only be the government, your statement can only be understood as a vague call for the government censorship of the Internet.However, neither your article, nor the CNN segment mentioned that our grotesque fiction was based on your own controversial ideas that many Americans found insulting and grotesque. Why? Was it because such an admission would have undermined your argument that people were angry at you over nothing? And why in the world, Fareed, did you decide to bring up the term \"radicalization,\" which in today's world is mostly associated with Islam? Do you have such a tin ear - or do you really think that if you broaden the definition and talk about \"American radicalization,\" people will begin to see the two as morally equivalent? Do you think they are morally equivalent, Fareed?Fine, let's talk about radicalization.For you, sitting on the top floors of your well-protected media establishment's ivory tower, it's easy to downplay the threat of Islamic radicalization and throw the \"Islamophobia\" labels at all those little people down at the street level. The only radicalization to which your skewed radar is attuned is the faintest sound of protest from the little people, when they get fed up with your condescending elitism and begin to rebel against the \"progressive\" establishment. That's what scares you the most, doesn't it, Fareed? That's when you mouth off your grave concerns on CNN and write in WaPo about the threat of radicalization. But who is at fault that Americans no longer trust the establishment and its media? Have you considered the possibility that none of this would be happening if you and your colleagues weren't so radical yourselves, feeding the people with half-truths, distortions, propaganda, and outright lies, placing your Utopian \"progressive\" ideology above facts, smug and secure in your impenetrable media castle? Did it occur to you that you and your media establishment may be the very reason why so many people suddenly like Donald Trump, whom you so despise , and nothing you say on the subject can change their minds because no one trusts you anymore?When you talked about a study where \"simply by talking to one another, the bigoted students had become more bigoted,\" has it even occurred to you how perfectly this describes your \"progressive\" echo chamber, where tolerance towards opposing philosophical viewpoints is nonexistent? If you think that calling those who disagree with you \"bigots\" makes you an anti-bigot, let me share a little secret. There are two kinds of bigots today: the bigots and the anti-bigots, and it's hard to say which kind is worse. A good example of \"group polarization\" involving radical \"anti-bigots\" is JournoList - a highly biased group of about 400 left-wing journalists and political activists who for three years (2007-2010) participated in a private online echo chamber where they, in violation of public trust and professional ethics, conspired to coordinate media attacks on conservatives, to promote certain issues while burying others, and to influence the 2008 elections in favor of Barack Obama. To paraphrase Kolbert's study, \"Simply by talking to one another, the radical left-wing journalists had become more radical left-wing journalists.\" To use your exact quote, \"It is how radicalization happens and extremism spreads.\" Say, were you just as worried about \"group polarization\" then as you are now?Another example of such \"group polarization\" and radicalization is a knee-jerk impulse of allegedly mainstream journalists to describe anyone who doesn't lean left as \"far-right,\" as you have demonstrated in your CNN segment, or \"ultra-right-wing,\" as you have demonstrated in your segment.Isn't it a little too late to complain about America's radicalization, Fareed? Where were you during the George W. Bush years, when your fellow \"progressives\" trolled, ridiculed, and slandered the U.S. President and his supporters, with full support of the mainstream media? When there no longer was any distinction between a drug-fueled street protester and a media commentator? Did you complain when \"progressive\" satirists collectively created a false, hyperbolic reality around Bush, conservatives, Fox News, and America in general, which was then regularly disseminated as the truth around the world, translated into many languages, and contributing to the anti-American sentiment? Some of my own family members in Russia and Ukraine still honestly believe that those \"facts\" really happened. As you so eloquently stated,\" the people spreading this story were not interested in the facts; they were interested in feeding prejudice.\" Did you complain then, or did it feel too good to let go?You refer to a scientific study of Facebook users, which found that \"people mainly shared information that confirmed their prejudices, paying little attention to facts and veracity.\" That sounds reasonable. For example, even without a scientific study I know that an overwhelming majority of your fellow \"progressives\" believe that Sarah Palin has actually said \"I can see Russia from my house,\" paying little attention to the fact that it originated as an SNL skit. Did you complain about that in 2008? Were you at all concerned that Tina Fey's \"Palin\" videos might confuse voters and skew the election? Probably not; it was just satirical hyperbole, right?What if social media encourage misinformation, rumors, and lies, you ask. But did you ask the same question when misinformation, rumors, and lies were coming not from social media but from a seasoned mainstream journalist named Dan Rather - or, more recently, The Rolling Stone Magazine? Or, worse yet, from the nation's political leaders whom you support and admire? Wasn't the entire debate on and implementation of ObamaCare based on misinformation and lies? Were you alarmed when Joe Biden told a black audience that the Republicans would put them back in chains? Did you speak against radicalization when the \"hands up don't shoot\" movement, based on misinformation, rumors, and lies, and encouraged by the mainstream media, resulted in looting and the destruction of property, followed by the murders of innocent police officers?The answer to all those question is \"no.\" You have never violated the \"progressive\" schema, Fareed. You've been a loyal Party soldier, albeit a mediocre creative thinker, having traded your \"otherness\" for conformity and sacrificing your unique perspective to what you thought was \"progress.\"Examples are plenty; more can be provided upon request. Now let's talk about victimhood. You say you are the victim because you have received some hateful messages and comments. I have also received many hateful messages and comments from your fellow \"progressives\" over the years. Now what? You claim you have received a late-night phone call that woke up and threatened your young daughters. Indeed, Fareed, making threatening calls is a crime. Did you file a police report? Did the police trace the number and find the perpetrators, who are hardly a sophisticated organization behind an impenetrable firewall? If not, I can't believe every claim that comes from a confirmed plagiarist . You may as well claim that someone kicked your three-legged puppy and it made you cry.\ufeffWhile you played the world's saddest song on the world's smallest violin, I was the one who took the real hit. Snopes.com, a \"fact-checking\" website rooting for the \"progressive\" team, has not only debunked our satire as they've done it many times in the past - this time they also made an unsourced and slanderous allegation that our site is \"known for spreading malware.\"Next, some busybody contacted one of our advertising providers, Content.ad, which then declined to pay our advertising earnings due to \"serious quality issues.\" The money we lost as a result may be small change compared to your CNN contract, but if you were penalized for your writings in the same proportional amount, I'm sure your righteous indignation would go well beyond just one article in WaPo and a five-minute segment on CNN. There is only one victim of lies, prejudice, and institutionalized bias here - and it ain't you, Fareed. But don't let this stop you from playing your upside-down game of \"victims and radicals\" while you still can. So you think your opponents are radicals? Here's a news tip: down here in the streets below you, it's the other way around: growing numbers of Americans see you and your media colleagues as radical ideological hacks. You can call them any name you want, adding ultra-, far-, uber-, and other hyphenated insults; that won't change the fact that their thinking is the norm and yours is not. Like all normal people on this planet, they don't respond well to insults. But they are also the ones who make sure you have the freedom to call them radicals. Oleg AtbashianDepartment of Visual Agitation and Unanimity 1/18/2016, 1:27 am Red Square,I must say, this morning when I heard Fareed refer to TPC as a \"minor news site\" I was terribly offended and had to be hospitalized for a number of hours.

I know he attacked our Glorious Kube, but he's clearly Muslim or related to Muslims (Judging by the Glorious Muslim name), which makes him a part of the Protekted Peoples of the Kubist Way. That means that you can't attack him. He is rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off of him and sticks on you. Anyways, the Kube is Eternal and Glorious, the attacks of someone like him can't damage it. Where there is Kommunism, there is the Kube, and as long as there is one person alive that is dedicated to the Eternally True Kommunist Way, then the Kube will live on. And Zakaria is actually helping the Kube, he is letting people know of it's existence, and once you have the Kube on your mind it won't go away. I thought I was immune to the Allure of the Kube since 2009 when I started reading it. That was until I decided to become a part of the Revolution and enlist in the People's Kubist Revolutionary Force.Besides, our Glorious Party Organ isn't satire, it's Eternal Current Truth! Laika lives on, she will never die! I get all my news from the Kube, it tells me what to think, since I can't actually think for myself anymore. I used to, but then I was revolutionized by the Kube. Can you say that about such satire websites as MSNBC, Fox News, or indeed CNN, the very organization that Zakaria thinks is credible and reputable? They're as credible as a man saying a stick is actually a brick! Sure, these Organs of the Enemy do tell people what to think since they can't think for themselves, and they CAN revolutionize somebody, but they all believe in \"rights\". Komrade, there is only one right I believe in, and that is the right to work for the state in glorious production! And they also believe in \"ethics\" and \"Honesty\". Well, if that were the case, why are they spreading so many lies about the Kube? And why do they think they have to ask everybody questions that can easily be answered by a simple NSA scan or FBI/DHS/DEA raid? That's what makes our and many other Party Organs so great, we can and do get right to the source WITHOUT the overhead![OFF]Were this a lecture hall, I would have given a standing ovation for the letter to Zakaria. 1/25/2016, 10:22 pm methadras Poor Fareed, his skin is so thin that when the wind blows he calls it an extremist racist troll that offends him. I tend to find the passing wind somewhat offensive. I'm not sure if it's racist though. Likely a climate denier. I'm sure of that! It denies me my comfortable climate! 4/3/2016, 11:37 pm This story is now being discussed in Sweden. I accidentally noticed a popular link leading to the Cube, and clicking on it resulted in a Swedish news portal. Google Chrome offers a more or less readable translation - the style is lost, but the content is quite good. Very well stated. Thanks for being here, Komrade.

Yeah, mi, it reminds me of the time when Robert Redford announced his retirement (first in a series) in a video, and some commenter said, and I paraphrase, \"Whew, for a minute there I thought I was watching my bulldog's ballsack.

We've got you covered.\" That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. \nWhen an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link. \nUSA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day.

Ongoing investigations into Pruitt's travel spending and security arrangements were playing out behind closed doors as a trove of new documents circulated among the Republican and Democratic staffers on the Hill.  Staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees EPA, began receiving new paperwork from the agency this week, Anthony Adragna reports. That follows Pruitt's promise to Chairman Greg Walden that EPA would provide the panel with \u201call the documents and information EPA produces\u201d for a host of ongoing inquiries into his conduct. And Pruitt's now-former security guard Pasquale \u201cNino\u201d Perrotta \u2014 who reports suggest was a willing partner in Pruitt's spending on travel and security \u2014 sat down with staff from the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday for several hours. Staffers declined to comment on the substance of that interview, but an aide said Democratic staffers took part in the transcribed session and have access to the documents EPA has shared with the committee.  Story Continued Below  The administrator has maintained a low profile this week. He was not sighted at a swearing-in of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which several of Pruitt\u2019s fellow Cabinet members \u2014 like Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke \u2014 attended. Still, other newly issued documents offered a fresh look into his lobbyist and industry ties. The emails, which were released via a public records request from the Sierra Club, showed consultant and Global Impact Inc. CEO Matthew C. Freedman helped to set the itinerary for a planned trip to Australia for Pruitt, though it was eventually canceled when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.  In the emails, Freedman warned EPA officials that Pruitt could get an angry reception from Australian officials who disagreed with the Trump administration on climate change. \u201cI think that the trip will be more hostile than what the Administrator may be expecting,\u201d wrote Freedman, who now runs an advisory firm and is treasurer of the American Australian Council, a nonprofit whose members include Chevron, BHP and ConocoPhillips. POLITICO's Alex Guill\u00e9n reports more on the details of the documents here. A draft schedule for the trip also included a visit and public appearance at the Australian parliament, though it noted such a stop raised \u201cpotential for protests, negative reaction.\u201d Trips to the Great Barrier Reef and Tasmania were also panned, dubbed a \"bridge too far.\"  More to come? Democratic Sens. Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse contended on Wednesday there were at least 3,100 pages of communications between Pruitt and special interest groups during his time as Oklahoma's AG that now have business before the agency and have yet to be released. In a letter to Pruitt and federal ethics officials, the pair says, the records, disclosed in state court proceedings, include 1,122 pages of \u201cemails containing documents, amicus briefs, and legal strategy which are part of litigation files.\"  Grain of salt: Of course, Pruitt still has the support of the president, who has yet to weigh in publicly since Pruitt's testimony last week. And Sen. Jim Inhofe, a vocal ally of Pruitt, told a reporter from The Oklahoman that he believes Pruitt still has President Donald Trump's support. \"That\u2019s the way President Trump is. He makes up his mind,\" Inhofe told Justin Wingerter. \"It\u2019s kind of like Jeff Sessions ... about five different times I thought he was going to fire him and he never did.\"  GOOD THURSDAY MORNING!

The FEC also dinged the PAC for waiting more than a month to provide missing donor information in previous filings. Read more.  POLL: VOTERS TURN ON PRUITT: Respondents in a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll turned more sharply negative on Pruitt after being told that he \u201cis under investigation for ethical infractions related to the amount of taxpayer money he has spent while in office, specifically on travel, his security detail and pay raises for his personal aides.\u201d Respondents were also informed that Pruitt testified before Congress that \u201che delegated authority to make spending decisions to members of his staff.\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Steven Shepard breaks down how after being told that information, 59 percent of respondents said Pruitt had not conducted himself appropriately. Far fewer, 11 percent, said Pruitt had acted appropriately.  Also in the poll: A slight majority \u2014 53 percent \u2014 said Pruitt should be removed from his position as EPA administrator, while 12 percent said he shouldn't be removed. More than one-third, 35 percent, had no opinion. \u201cAlthough Republicans are dissatisfied with Scott Pruitt\u2019s behavior, they do not necessarily want him out as EPA administrator,\u201d said Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult\u2019s co-founder and chief research officer. \u201cWhile 48 percent of Republicans say Scott Pruitt has conducted himself inappropriately as EPA administrator, only 38 percent say he should be removed from his position.\u201d See the poll toplines here and the crosstabs here.  SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SOMMER\u2019S DAY: The American Petroleum Institute officially announced Wednesday Mike Sommers will replace Jack Gerard at the helm of the powerful oil and gas trade group.

BISHOP TO TRAVEL TO PUERTO RICO: House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop is traveling to Puerto Rico this week to survey the island\u2019s recovery in the aftermath of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, he said Wednesday. \u201cThis trip will help me better understand the continuing challenges and what disaster relief is still needed,\u201d the chairman said in a statement. Bishop is set to meet with Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez while there.  Separately, Democratic Rep. Don Beyer requested a hearing on the status of the territory's recovery in a brief letter to Bishop, writing the \"committee has been silent,\" on a host of issues including the island-wide blackout and the privatization of PREPA, among other topics. A spokeswoman for Bishop called Beyer\u2019s claim that the committee had been silent \u201cabsolutely baseless, half-baked and politically motivated,\u201d noting that the committee has held multiple hearings, forums and sent letters on the topic.  MAIL CALL! THE ISDS OF MAY: API, NAM, the Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined together in a letter to President Donald Trump and other Cabinet officials on Wednesday on NAFTA, noting that though they support \u201cefforts to modernize NAFTA to grow the U.S. economy and support American jobs\u201d they want the administration to retain the investment protections and the investor-state dispute settlement.

But a spokesperson for Interior told the Associated Press the proposed changes are largely technical in nature and arrived via feedback the agency received about the 2015 plans from governors in sage grouse states.

FREEZE FRAME: The administration\u2019s plan to freeze CAFE standards at 2020 levels through 2025 would have an impact on fuel economy, oil consumption and GHG emissions, according to a new report today from Rhodium\u2019s U.S. Climate Service. The report found that freezing CAFE standards at 2020 levels would increase oil consumption in the U.S. by between 126,000 and 283,000 barrels per day in 2025, depending on oil prices. By 2030, the report finds, that impact would be 221,000-644,000, when assuming no change in post-2025 standards. Read the report here.

THAT'S ALL FOR ME!  ** A message from America\u2019s ethanol producers and farm supporters at Growth Energy: The boost from high-octane ethanol enhances engine performance and allows for more efficient engine designs. In fact, NASCAR drivers have been running on 15 percent ethanol blends since 2011. Today, E15 is approved for nine out of 10 cars on the road, and consumers have driven over five billion miles using E15. That\u2019s why America\u2019s biofuel leaders at Growth Energy are calling on the EPA to act quickly on the president\u2019s plan to unleash competition at the fuel pump and allow sales of E15 year-round.

Curbelo, Diaz-Balart make their move \u2014 FIU\u2019s bridge collapse coverup Presented by AARP  By Marc Caputo (mcaputo@politico.com; @MarcACaputo) and Matt Dixon (mdixon@politico.com; @Mdixon55), with Emily Goldberg (egoldberg@politico.com; @ejgold94) and the staff of POLITICO Florida  It\u2019s Thursday morning, Florida Playbookers. And the news doesn\u2019t rest. In Washington, Rep. Carlos Curbelo joined a group of renegade Republicans filing a discharge petition to bring immigration matters directly to the House floor. At least 17 other Republicans signed on, including fellow Miami Republican Mario Diaz Balart. But they need at least 25 Republicans and all 193 Democrats to get to the needed 218. Did we mention it\u2019s an election year? In Florida, former Rep. Gwen Graham is about to get whacked by the first negative ad campaign of the Democratic primary for governor. And Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s administration is on defense after state corrections officials gave a violent felon a \u201cminimum risk\u201d rating only to see him kill a cop. Also, it turns out, the state has a flawed background check system that could allow Florida\u2019s mentally ill to buy guns. It\u2019s just another day at one of Florida\u2019s busiest intersections: guns and politics. So let\u2019s start there.  Story Continued Below  ...THE GUNSHINE STATE...  UNNOTICED \u2014 \u201cBackground check gap could allow Florida mentally ill to buy guns,\u201d by POLITICO Florida\u2019s Matt Dixon: In Florida, a state with some of the nation\u2019s worst mass shootings in recent years, nearly 20 percent of mental health records are entered late into a background check database, a long-running problem state law enforcement officials now acknowledge could lead to someone with a known mental illness buying a gun. The lapse, which dates back to at least 2014, went unnoticed by state lawmakers and the governor\u2019s office until POLITICO asked about the issue. \u201cThe risk of late reporting of mental health records is that an individual who is prohibited from purchasing or possession a firearm may be approved at the time of the background check if the disqualifying mental health record is not available,\u201d read Florida Department of Law Enforcement documents from last month that are part of an application for U.S. Department of Justice funding to help solve the problem.  The state agency is now asking for $94,880 from the Department of Justice to fund a pilot program in the Miami-Dade Clerk of Courts office. The money would fund a position to identify and enter \u201cdisqualifying mental health records within expected timeframes,\u201d according to an outline of FDLE\u2019s request, which was approved last month by the state\u2019s Criminal and Juvenile Justice Information Systems Council. Clerks in each county are responsible for entering mental health records that would disqualify someone from buying a gun into the Florida Mental Competency application, which is overseen by FDLE.

His record was long enough, according to sources at the Florida Department of Corrections, for the agency label him a \u2018violent felon of special concern\u2019 when Ables was again sentenced to felony probation in 2016 for battery on an elderly person.\u201d Read more  SEE JANE SUE \u2014 \u201cBondi to NRA: No dice on your secret \u2018Jane Doe\u2019 plaintiffs,\u201d by Orlando Sentinel\u2019s Scott Maxwell: \u201cGive Attorney General Pam Bondi credit (six words I don\u2019t write very often) for standing up to the NRA in an unusual battle over secrecy. The latest development has Bondi fighting back against the NRA\u2019s desire to add anonymous \u2018Jane Doe\u2019 plaintiffs to its lawsuit challenging restrictions on gun sales to people under the age of 21. Basically, the state is arguing that, if someone claims they have been victimized by a law, the public deserves a chance to vet those claims \u2026 something you can\u2019t do when you don\u2019t even know who the alleged victim is.\u201d Read more  THE AFTERMATH \u2014 \u201cThe far-reaching effects of a mass shooting: Hospital lockdowns leave some stranded,\u201d by WLRN\u2019s Jessica Bakeman: \u201cOn the afternoon of Feb. 14, Fawn Patterson got a call from her daughter telling her to come to the hospital. Amanda Ray Carrillo was pregnant with her fifth child, and she was bleeding. She\u2019d been admitted to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale the day before but hadn\u2019t gotten answers yet about what was wrong. She wanted her mom to be there when the doctor came to explain. When Patterson got to the hospital, there was a security guard blocking the door. The facility was on lockdown after receiving several victims from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Earlier that day, a gunman had opened fire at the school and killed 17 people and injuring another 17.\u201d Read more  TARGETING VERN \u2014 \u201cGiffords gun-control group targets NRA-friendly Florida congressman with ad,\u201d by Sun Sentinel\u2019s Skyler Swisher: \u201cA gun-control group is throwing money into the battle for Congress, directing one of its first ads toward a Republican Florida representative supported by the gun lobby. The Giffords Political Action Committee spent $120,000 in advertisements this week, including $12,000 in digital ads opposing U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The ad attacks Buchanan for accepting $15,450 in contributions from the National Rifle Association. Buchanan \u2014 who represents Sarasota and Bradenton in Congress \u2014 is the only Florida representative Giffords\u2019 group has targeted so far.\u201d Read more  ...TRUMPLANDIA AND THE SWAMP...  DIS-CHARGE IT! \u2014 \u201cRepublicans move to force DACA vote in defiance of Ryan,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Rachael Bade: \u201cCentrist House Republicans are defying Speaker Paul Ryan and planning to force a floor vote shielding Dreamers from deportation, a last-ditch attempt at securing a deal on immigration. By filing a discharge petition Wednesday morning, the five centrists who work closely on immigration issues are hoping to pressure President Donald Trump and GOP leaders into working with Democrats to codify Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Trump ended the Obama-era program in March, but the courts intervened and now DACA will be considered by the Supreme Court this fall.\u201d Read more  THE TEST \u2014 As we mentioned above, the petition was brought by Curbelo and signed by Diaz-Balart (as well as outgoing Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen). Though this effort comes during an election year when Curbelo and Diaz-Balart face potentially tough Democratic challengers, we don\u2019t question their motives. For years they\u2019ve talked about the need for immigration reform and, specifically, protecting Dreamers. But they\u2019ve also insisted that a good number of Republicans want to help Dreamers. But is that true? Only 17 of 235 Republicans have signed the petition just calling for a vote on immigration? That\u2019s about 7 percent of the GOP caucus. And the House would have four options to choose from, so they\u2019re not locked into one bill. House Speaker Paul Ryan is fighting the effort even though he had once promised the issue would be brought to the floor. Some argue they don\u2019t like the process of a discharge petition. But at a certain point, process is a flimsy excuse for gridlock.  \u2014 \u201cDis-charge!

The Monday letter from Trump campaign attorney Lawrence Rosen accused the club of misrepresenting itself and confusing the public and demands corrective action by Friday. Club president Annie Marie Delgado denied the claims in the letter, blaming \u2018fake Republicans\u2019 for stirring up controversy. But Delgado said adding a disclaimer, as demanded by Rosen, would be a \u2018great idea.\u2019\u201d Read more  STORMY WITH A 100% CHANCE OF WEIRDNESS \u2014 \u201cStormy Daniels to perform at scandalous strip club known for trolling politicians,\u201d by Miami Herald\u2019s David Smiley: \u201cIn what may be the greatest Miami marriage ever between pornography and politics, the most politically relevant porn star in U.S. history is coming to South Florida to dance in one of South Florida's most notorious strip clubs. Stormy Daniels, the adult performer who was paid $130,000 during the 2016 presidential campaign to stay silent about an alleged tryst with President Donald Trump, has a contract to perform at Miami Beach's Club Madonna, an all-nude venue that's been trolling city politicians for years, according to owner Leroy Griffith.\u201d Read more  WHAT HAPPENED IN NIGER? \u2014 \u201cCongresswoman close to soldier killed in Niger raises suspicions about Pentagon investigation,\u201d by Washington Post\u2019s Dan Lamothe: \u201cRep.

NO GOOD FOR GWEN \u2014 \u201cGraham trashed as phony progressive in first negative TV ad of Democratic gubernatorial race,\u201d by POLITICO Florida\u2019s Marc Caputo: An outside group is spending more than $782,000 on the Florida gubernatorial Democratic primary\u2019s first negative television ad campaign that casts former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham as a fake progressive who opposed former President Barack Obama on numerous votes. The 30-second commercial is placed by The Collective super PAC, which supports African-American candidates nationwide and backs one of her primary rivals, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. POLITICO reported Wednesday that the ad buy was in support of Gillum, but the group made clear it\u2019s going after Graham in the ad, which is running in the West Palm Beach broadcast TV market and numerous cable networks throughout the state.

Ron DeSantis for Governor of Florida continues to draw fire from entrenched, establishment interests. Last week witnessed the launching of a ridiculous new tv ad which aims to smear the man they most fear, Ron DeSantis. The culprit is the so-called National Liberty Federation, which is a dark money front group for heavily-subsidized sugar interests like US Sugar Corp., which is a major supporter of anti-Trump, pro-open borders establishment candidate Adam Putnam. The NLF\u2019s previous $1 million-plus tv and radio campaign was a total dud because it was a demonstrably false attack that tried to characterize DeSantis\u2019 opposition to Barack Obama\u2019s food stamp policies as tantamount to wanting to extend food stamps to illegal aliens.

Corcoran had never officially announced his run for the state's top executive office, but heavy fundraising and TV commercials indicated his plan to become a third serious GOP contender. But with the August primary roughly four months away, his hopes of taking the governor's mansion have been dashed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have the resources to move forward,\" Corcoran said during a news conference in Tallahassee. \u201cGiven the fact that 2018 is going to be a crucial election, I think it\u2019s important we rally around and figure out who\u2019s the best person to lead this state.\u201d Read more  MURPHY\u2019S LAW \u2014 \u201cDemocrat Amanda Murphy jumps into race for Jack Latvala\u2019s old Senate seat,\u201d by the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Steve Contorno: Read more  ...PENINSULA AND BEYOND...

Miami area teachers can now only afford 9 percent of area homes, according to new data from Trulia. That\u2019s down 9.7 percentage points in just one year, thanks to a 5.9% decrease in overall teacher wages, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and a 12.8% increase in list prices. Trulia said the median income for Miami teachers is now $49,013, while the median home price in the Miami metro area is $450,000.\u201d Read more  PUERTO RICO DEBT CRISIS TAKEAWAYS \u2014 \u201cHere is what the U.S. GAO reported about Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis,\u201d by Latino Rebels: \u201cAccording to the GAO\u2019s Fast Facts section about this report, here are the three major takeaways:  \u2014 \u201cPuerto Rico has roughly $70 billion in outstanding debt, and since August 2015 has defaulted on over $1.5 billion in debt. One factor contributing to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt levels is the Puerto Rico government\u2019s persistent annual deficits, where expenses exceeded revenues.  \u2014 \u201cPuerto Rico\u2019s government has borrowed money to finance its operations, rather than cutting spending, raising taxes, or both.  \u2014 \u201cWe identified various potential federal actions that could help address factors contributing to the debt crisis. These include altering the tax-exempt status of Puerto Rico municipal debt, and applying federal investor protection laws to Puerto Rico.\u201d Read more  COLLAPSING CREDIBILITY \u2014 \u201cCracks where FIU bridge buckled may have signaled \u2018imminent failure,\u2019\u201d by Miami Herald\u2019s Andres Viglucci, Nicholas Nehamas and Jenny Staletovich: \u201cA key concrete support truss in the doomed Florida International University pedestrian bridge developed worrisome cracks 10 days before the structure was lifted into place over the Tamiami Trail, photographs and an internal email unintentionally released by the school show.

Daytona Beach Police Chief Craig Capri admitted Hattie Reynolds probably wasn\u2019t a threat, but said domestic violence law requires that an arrest be made.

Is a state shutdown looming?\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Matt Arco and Brent Johnson: \u201cDon't be shocked if your plans for Fourth of July weekend are derailed by another state government shutdown. New Jersey legislative leaders \u2014 including state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and state Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin \u2014 told Gov. Phil Murphy face-to face this past week they don't support his plan to increase the state's sales tax, two sources familiar with the talks told NJ Advance Media. They also pushed back on Murphy's plans to offer free tuition to county colleges, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the meetings were private.\u201d Read the report  \u2014\u201cCoughlin: \u2018I would prefer we do not\u2019 raise sales tax,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Katherine Landergan: \u201cAssembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, in his strongest comments to date on the issue, cast doubt Friday on Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s proposal to restore the state sales tax to 7 percent, saying the move would hurt residents across all income brackets. \u2018I would prefer we do not reinstate the three-eighths of a point,\u2019 Coughlin (D-Middlesex) said on his monthly \u201cSpeak to the Speaker\u201d show on WCTC talk radio. \u2018I recognize that probably in each transaction it\u2019s not a lot [of money], but, cumulatively, that\u2019s a lot and that affects people of all socioeconomic levels.\u2019 ... Coughlin does not appear to be alone in his resistance to raising the sales tax, according to two legislative sources with knowledge of the discussions who were not at liberty to discuss them publicly. One Democratic source said Assembly lawmakers view the sales tax hike as the worst of Murphy's tax proposals, for a few reasons. It's a tax that is most open to misinterpretation and opponents could easily use it as fodder to target Democratic lawmakers. There's also the fear the public would view this as reneging on an earlier promise, the source said ... a Democratic source [in the Senate] said the chamber's caucus is backing Coughlin on his resistance to the sales tax increase. \u201d Read the report  LOOK, EVERYTHING TURNED OUT FINE FOR HIM \u2014 \u201cFormer NJ Gov.

This is not welcome news for Gov. Phil Murphy. What\u2019s the smiling-brooding Hamlet-like Murphy to do as he dodges questions about whether he really smoked pot or if he can find enough Democrats to vote for a tax hike? On some strange level, you can almost envision Murphy, while strutting through the statehouse as he contemplates the upcoming state budget battles, glumly stopping at Florio's official portrait on a wall to ask this Shakespearean question: \"To tax or not to tax.\" Florio\u2019s answer is simple: Don't be afraid.\u201d Read the column  \u2014\u201cJim Florio: Lessons from a life in politics and a fight over N.J.'s assault weapon ban\u201d Read the report  \u2014\u201cGov.

Phil Murphy to veto a bill sitting on his desk that would bail out the state\u2019s nuclear plants, arguing the controversial measure fails to protect state ratepayers. Environmentalists say the bill would raise costs in a state whose electricity rates are already high. They have boosted their efforts to kill the measure, seizing on comments made by Ralph Izzo, CEO of Public Service Enterprise Group, that subsidies could benefit nuclear plants outside of New Jersey. Opponents also say the bill doesn\u2019t protect the use of ratepayer dollars and would restrict how much the state can subsidize other clean energy projects, such as offshore wind, which can cost billions to construct. Murphy, a Democrat who took office in January, has promised to install 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind generation by 2030, the largest commitment in the nation.

Instead, he said he\u2019ll consider running to replace the retiring John Pecoraro as Morris County surrogate. In a conversation Friday morning at the Morristown Deli, a popular spot for political gatherings, Carroll succinctly identified the problem. \u2018The Dems don\u2019t need us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the world more impotent than a legislative minority.\u2019 Carroll, who just turned 60 and who lives in Morris Township, has been in the Assembly since 1996, representing District 25 in northern and western Morris County. No, he has not always been in the minority \u2014 at least not technically.

The reopening this summer of the former Trump Taj Mahal as a Hard Rock casino, and the former Revel as the Ocean Resort Casino, is being hailed in this seaside gambling resort as a welcome recovery from the trauma of 2014, when four casinos shut down. (The Taj Mahal joined them in 2016.) And the owner of the Showboat hotel is considering reopening a casino there, as well. The party line in Atlantic City is that the reopened casinos \u2014 particularly Hard Rock, with its proven worldwide ability to attract guests with its music-themed resorts \u2014 will grow the market and not simply siphon off business from weaker competitors. Of course, that's exactly what Revel's managers said \u2014 and that casino lasted barely over two years.\u201d Read the report  \u2014Moran: \u201cScholarships for Dreamers.

A few years ago, amid escalating gang violence in El Salvador \u2014 which now has one of the highest homicide rates of any nation in the world \u2014 Jose took advantage of the Obama Administration's Central American Minors program. As a non-citizen with legal status, Jose was able to work with the refugee resettlement agency in New Jersey, the International Rescue Committee, to bring his children and wife into the U.S. The family was vetted, with security checks and DNA tests, and last year they were given the okay to travel to Jose's home in Orange, N.J. But in August, President Trump's Department of Homeland Security abruptly [canceled] the program as part of a larger crackdown on legal immigration. The children were still allowed to come since they had already been approved, and they arrived in March. But Mirna was not. She is marooned in El Salvador, unable to see her children this Mother's Day.\u201d Read the report  THAT\u2019S YUUUUUGE-IN \u2014 \u201cTrump may have just boosted Menendez's re-election prospects with speech on drug prices,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Jonathan D. Salant: \u201cDid President Donald Trump just help a Democratic New Jersey senator he'd love to see lose this November? In the audience during Trump's speech on prescription drugs Friday was a woman who presence highlighted a vulnerability faced by Bob Hugin, the retired Celgene Corp. executive trying to take on U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez this fall. Pam Holt, a retired schoolteacher from Granger, Indiana, who has the rare blood cancer multiple myeloma, spends $640 a month on Revlimid, an anti-cancer drug manufactured by Summit-based Celgene. To pay for the drug, she recently had to refinance her home. She said she has no choice but to pay the going rate for the drug because Celgene under Hugin stymied efforts by competitors to obtain the Revlimid samples they needed to produce lower-priced generics, and successfully lobbied to kill legislation aimed at removing such barriers.\u201d Read the report  HYPOCRISY WATCH \u2014 Remember the several days of outrage from the Trump administration and its allies after a comedian made some kind of mean jokes about Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Gov. Christie was among them. \u201cThe performance at the WHCD was awful,\u201d Christie tweeted . \u201cHer pounding of .@PressSec and .@KellyannePolls was mean spirited and not funny. Pathetic performance.\u201d So now we know that White House aide Kelly Sadler joked that she didn\u2019t care about John McCain\u2019s position on Gina Haspel\u2019s nomination for CIA director because \u201che\u2019s dying anyway.\u201d The White House, after all that umbrage it took, is refusing to apologize. And Christie, who built his whole career on the tough guy \u201ctell it like it is\u201d persona, has not responded to my questions on Twitter about it. Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick, who criticized the Sanders roast, is being consistent. \u201cVery sad that anyone thinks that comment is a joke,\u201d he told me with regard to Sadler. \u201cIt demonstrates that we have become so divided that the serious illness of a United States Senator can be partisan. Hopefully the reasonable Americans will stand together against the extremists and speak out.\u201d  RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE \u2014\"Some NJ congressional primary candidates argue party-line politics are unfair,\" by NJ Spotlight's Colleen O'Dea: \u201cOnly those candidates who are endorsed by a county party committee, made up of party members from the voting districts in each municipality and a leadership team, get to use the county committee\u2019s name or slogan on the ballot \u2026 \u2018What point are the primaries if you already know you are going to support the line?\u2019 asks Peter Jacob, one of three Democrats remaining in the primary in the 7th District in Central Jersey. \u2018Is it fair?

Jeffery Jones, the mayor before Torres, became entangled in an overtime scandal and his popularity plummeted so severely that he finished fourth when he ran for re-election. Martin Barnes, the mayor before Torres and Jones, went to federal prison after pleading guilty to accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts \u2014 including a swimming pool and female companionship \u2014 from a city contractor. During that ignominious sequence of failed leadership, Paterson\u2019s problems worsened. The city became known as the heroin capital of North Jersey.

                              "text": "Things were looking good for William Negley, who was on track to make the runoff in the 18-way Republican primary for Texas' 21st Congressional District.  But just a few days before the March 6 election, radio and digital ads began popping up warning voters that after Donald Trump clinched the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, \"Negley backed the idea of an independent campaign against him that could've divided Republicans and helped\" Hillary Clinton.  The 11th-hour ads, deployed by an outside group supporting one of Negley's rivals, were based on him hitting the \"like\" button on a couple of tweets during the presidential race. One referenced a Politico story on Evan McMullin's independent bid and the other was from conservative writer David French, who called such a campaign a \"national necessity.\"    On Election Day, Negley missed the runoff by just under 1,000 votes.  The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.  \"We faced some unexpected campaign attacks in the last 96 hours of the race,\" Negley later told supporters in a somber Facebook video, \"and ultimately fell just short of the votes needed to make the runoff.\"  Negley's demise was an early case study in how the presidential litmus test could shake up a Texas primary \u2014 and a sign of what was to come.  With just over a week until another Election Day \u2014 early voting starts Monday \u2014 nearly all six of the Republican congressional runoffs in Texas have turned into a pitched battle over who supports the president more, or who has done just about anything that could be construed as anti-Trump. It is playing out on debate stages, on TV and the radio, on social media and in mailboxes, sending candidates scrambling to prove their support for Trump.  The dynamic is predominantly driven by the Club for Growth, the national conservative group that was behind the Negley takedown. Its super PAC has spent more than $2 million on Texas primaries and runoffs this election cycle \u2014 much of that on ads trumpeting their candidates as Trump allies and attacking their opponents as hostile to the president.  David McIntosh, the Club for Growth's president, said in an interview that the group's polling shows Trump remains very popular among Texas primary voters, with his approval rating topping 90 percent in some districts.  \"Republican primary voters \u2014 very much so in Texas but also around the country \u2014 want Congress to defend the president\" and advance his agenda, McIntosh said. \"They're frustrated with Republicans in Congress not getting more done. That's made it the No. 1 issue in these races.\"  The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.  In the 5th Congressional District, the Club has endorsed Bunni Pounds for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas \u2014 and spent lavishly to portray her opponent, state Rep. Lance Gooden of Terrell, as out of step with Trump on his signature policy achievement thus far. \"Trump cut taxes, but Gooden backed higher taxes\" in the Legislature, one ad alleges.    Gooden has cried foul over the attacks \u2014 as far back as the winter of 2016, he was traveling to South Carolina to campaign for Trump ahead of the state's primary. Gooden recently recorded a video message to supporters from a post office, waving a mail piece purporting to show him spray-painting devil horns on a portrait of the president.  \"Folks, this is ridiculous,\" Gooden says in the video. \"I was the earliest supporter of Trump of anyone in this race, and the negativity is outlandish.\"  In the 27th Congressional District \u2014 where U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Corpus Christi, recently resigned \u2014 the Club has spent more than half a million dollars backing candidate Michael Cloud in the runoff and savaging his rival, Bech Bruun, as a \"career bureaucrat\" and \"swamp creature\" while highlighting Bruun's opposition to term limits. \"No way will Bruun stand with Trump to change things in Washington,\" one ad says.    And in the 21st District \u2014 where the Club has endorsed Chip Roy to succeed retiring U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio \u2014 it has even tried to drive a a wedge between Roy's opponent, Matt McCall, and Trump by comparing McCall to U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. One mailer accuses McCall of peddling \"the same anti-Trump fake news as the liberal media and left-wing\" politicians like Pelosi, citing a comment he made at a debate questioning Roy's ties to Cambridge Analytica, the embattled data firm that worked for Cruz's campaign before Trump's in the 2016 race.  McCall has called the mailer a \"bold-faced lie\" and proof that Roy's allies are getting desperate.  In that race, the Trump loyalty debate has not stopped there. More recently, Roy's campaign and its allies have pounced on a tongue-in-cheek comment McCall made at a forum Monday, saying he supports Trump's policies but would not necessarily want the president to be left alone with his daughters.    Ironically, the Club has its own complicated past with Trump \u2014 it spent millions of dollars trying to defeat him in the 2016 primary. That has not gone unnoticed by the Texas candidates whose pro-Trump credentials are now being assailed by the group.  The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.  \"It is a Washington, D.C.-based special interest group that clearly has a history of being anti-Trump,\" Bruun said in an interview. \"The feedback we get is that folks are ... highly suspicious [of] where this is all of a sudden coming from.\"  McIntosh shrugged off the criticism, saying it is no secret the Club had other preferences in the primary \u2014 it endorsed Cruz in the late stages of the nominating contest. But shortly after Trump won the nomination, the Club \"helped him campaign on the free-market agenda,\" McIntosh said, and has supported many of his top priorities in the White House.  The Trump-fueled acrimony is also unfolding in Texas races where the Club is not involved. In the runoff for the 2nd Congressional District \u2014 where U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Houston, is not seeking re-election \u2014 Houston state Rep. Kevin Roberts has seized on a series of years-old Facebook posts from his opponent, Dan Crenshaw, to paint him as unfriendly to Trump. In a 2015 post that has drawn the most scrutiny from Roberts and his allies, Crenshaw writes that Trump's \"insane rhetoric\" toward Muslims \"is hateful\" and takes away from conversations around \"the reform of Islam.\" He also calls Trump an idiot while writing of \"equally ignorant liberals\" on the other side of the debate.    In addition to Roberts, the Facebook post has incurred the wrath of a big-spending super PAC called Conservative Results Matter, which cites it in a dramatic TV ad that labels Crenshaw an \"anti-Trump liberal.\"  Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, has pushed back on the line of attack by noting that \u2014 like many Republicans \u2014 Trump was not his first choice in the 2016 primary. But he got behind Trump when he became the nominee and has since been a strong supporter of his agenda.  Roberts, who says he voted for Trump in the Texas primary, is not buying it.  \"You can say all day that 'I supported another candidate,' but it is dramatically different to have supported another candidate and then simultaneously call him an idiot, insane and ignorant, hateful,\" Roberts said. \"That\u2019s something you would expect Hillary [Clinton] to say, not someone who purports to be a conservative Republican.\"    For all the efforts to make presidential loyalty a central issue in the runoffs, the strategy had mixed results in the March 6 primaries. While it proved successful against contenders like Negley, there were ample examples of candidates who embraced Trump yet did not make the cut.  In the 2nd Congressional District, longtime GOP donor Kathaleen Wall spent millions of dollars airing TV ads, some of which made direct comparisons between her and the president, only to finish third behind Crenshaw and Roberts. And in the 21st District, Robert Stovall, the former chairman of the Bexar County GOP, fell short of runoff territory despite having a loyal supporter in Brad Parscale, the San Antonio native and top Trump campaign adviser, and releasing an ad that showed him promising to drain the swamp \u2014 while standing in a literal one.    Trump himself has not weighed in on any of the Texas congressional races, even as he has endorsed \u2014 and, in some cases, re-endorsed \u2014 all of Texas' statewide officials for re-election. The closest thing to a seal of approval from the White House is in the 5th District, where Vice President Mike Pence has backed Pounds to replace Hensarling, Pence's longtime friend and former House colleague who is also supporting Pounds.    Privately, some GOP operatives involved in the races acknowledge how absurd the battle for the pro-Trump upper hand has become. One likened it to a \"game of limbo\" where candidates are seeing how low they can go to position themselves as the most pro-Trump name on the ballot.  The Trump litmus test has left Democratic candidates licking their chops for the fall, even in traditionally Republican districts. They believe that their GOP rivals are making a deal with the devil, embracing the president to win over hardcore party loyalists in the primary, only to find a much less receptive electorate awaiting them in November.  \"There are a lot of disaffected Republicans \u2014 I call them orphaned Republicans \u2014 who, now that we have the party of Trump and the Republican Party has been taken over by Trump, don\u2019t feel like they have a home anymore,\" said Joseph Kopser, who is in a Democratic runoff with Mary Wilson to face either McCall or Roy in the 21st District. The two Republicans, Kopser added, \"have wrapped themselves in such a dilemma that it is going to be fascinating to watch them try to thread this needle\" in the fall.  The pro-Trump forces are undeterred. The Club in particular is not planning to let up in the final days before the May 22 runoffs.  Do Texas' Republican voters \"want to go the play-it-safe route that [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell has been doing in the Senate, or do they want the bolder shake-up-the-place approach that Trump represents?\" McIntosh asked. \"From a national standpoint, I think Texas will set the tone for the rest of the country.\"  Disclosure: Joseph Kopser has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

                              "text": " Trump Camp Accused Of Anti-Semitism President Trump Has Shattered Jews' American Idyll November 14, \" Haaretz \" - American Jews have transformed virtually overnight from insiders to outsiders; the appointment of ex-Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon, an accused anti-Semite, as chief strategist, is bound to exacerbate the tensions.\nBy Chemi Shalev WASHINGTON \u0096 Those were the best of times, arguably, but these may be the worst of times. That\u0092s the way most American Jews must feel as they wake up with a massive hangover from the shock election results and the reality that Donald Trump will soon be President of the United States.\nWhatever differences American Jews may have had with Barack Obama over the Iran nuclear deal and Middle East peace, they\u0092ve never had a president who was more in tune with their Jewish and liberal essence.\nObama was the realization of the American Jewish vision of a multicultural society, a dream come true for a generation of civil rights activists. He promoted and embodied the liberal ideals that American Jews are more attached to than any other religious group in America. And he was more knowledgeable about American Jewish culture and Yiddishkeit than any previous president, bar none. Even when they disagreed with him, most American Jews, with the exception of the vocal minority that hated his guts, viewed Obama as a mensch.\nIt is probably no coincidence that during his tenure, American Jews reached a pinnacle of social and cultural acceptance. Being American Jews was hip. It was cool. It was the thing to be. From Jon Stewart to Jerry Seinfeld, from Joe Lieberman to Bernie Sanders, Jews seemed to be more entrenched than ever before in the American mainstream. Pew Research Polls repeatedly confirmed that Jews were the most loved and most admired religious group in all of America. Mashiach-zeit, old timers would say, but with a note of caution, because if Jewish history teaches anything, it is that all things must pass.\nThe election of Donald Trump has shattered the Jewish idyll, all across the board. Although one must give the president-elect the benefit of the doubt that he is not an anti-Semite himself, he has frequently promoted disparaging Jewish stereotypes in his personal statements. Sunday evening\u0092s appointment of former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist in the White House is bound to exacerbate Jewish tensions. He is considered the standard bearer for the racist, anti-immigrant alt-right movement and has been accused of harboring anti-Semitic sentiments himself.\nTrump has repeatedly and unapologetically disseminated white supremacist tweets. His campaign has used anti-Semitic symbols that Trump has failed to disown even when advised of their offensive content. He has distanced himself from his neo-Nazi supporters only under duress. And under his wings, America has seen an unprecedented outburst of blunt and naked hatred of Jews, which has only gotten worse since his election.\nIn recent months, most prominent Jewish journalists and other public critics of Trump have been harassed by anti-Semites on social media, in their mail at home and, in some cases, in close physical contact. Swastikas have been painted at schools. Jewish students have been threatened, taunted, told that Adolf Hitler was right all along. Along with Muslims, Hispanics, and African Americans, they are being targeted as the sworn enemies of the America First Weltanschauung that Trump is bringing with him to the White House.\nThe shock that many Jews are feeling now is partly of their making. In recent years, the American Jewish establishment has willingly enlisted in the Israeli government\u0092s effort to depict ever-widening circles of anti-Israeli agitation on the left as anti-Semitism. The fight against BDS and the efforts to portray it as hatred of Jews in another form has consumed the time, energy and resources of the American Jewish leadership, with the possible exception of the Anti-Defamation League.\nMeanwhile, virulent and classic anti-Semitism lurking just under the radical right\u0092s surface was virtually ignored, concealed by the mainstream right-wing\u0092s overwhelming support for Israel. Even mentioning it was considered to be an anti-Israeli provocation.\nTrump\u0092s triumph has unleashed the pent up resentment against Jews. His reluctance to tackle manifestations of racism and white supremacism among his supporters has energized and empowered it. If he and his advisers don\u0092t take assertive steps soon, anti-Jewish agitators will feel they have a license from the White House to do as they please. They will get bolder, grow stronger, recruit new adherents and increasingly resort to violence: we\u0092ve seen it before.\nBut even if brazen anti-Semitic incidents are quelled or die down by themselves, there is no denying that Jews have transformed virtually overnight from insiders to outsiders. Not only did they vote overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prominent conservative Jews who could have allayed their concerns are the ones who have distanced themselves from Trump over the course of the campaign and will play no role in his administration.\nAmerican Jewish liberals are bound to feel alienated from their own government in way they\u0092ve never felt before. Most of the values, goals and policy objectives of the Trump administration, even if they turn out to be a paler and more palatable version of his campaign rhetoric, are diametrically opposed to those of most American Jews. They support immigration, pluralism, multiculturalism, social reform, government intervention, separation of church and state, gay marriage, abortion rights and on and on. It is easy to see, in fact, why so many of Trump\u0092s radical supporters would view the Jews as their mortal enemies.\nAs Shmuel Rosner rightly points out for the wrong reasons, Trump may ultimately divide Israeli and American Jews. But the reason for that is not limited, as Rosner asserts, to the yet to be proven assumption that American Jews will resent their Israeli counterparts for liking Trump because he is pro-Israel. It is because Trump\u0092s core message, his reactionary, nativist, chauvinistic, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant and mainly anti-Muslim worldview is shared by far too many, though far from all Israelis, and is embraced by its ruling coalition. And because many Israeli Jews are indifferent to right-wing anti-Semitism and indeed share right-wing disdain toward the liberalism of American Jews.\nOf course, all may not be bleak. Perhaps Trump will fight the anti-Semitism on his radical fringe with increasing vigor. Possibly his policies will be less offensive to American Jews. Perhaps the American Jewish establishment will produce a leadership capable of meeting these trying times. Who knows, maybe some American Jews will finally realize they should support Israeli Jews who share their worldview rather than a government that doesn\u0092t.\nAnd if worse comes to worst, to paraphrase Casablanca, liberal American Jews will always have Israel itself. Moderate, liberal Israelis, beleaguered and on the point of despair, will flock to the airport to welcome them with open arms. Mashiach-zeit, they will tell themselves, in awe. \u0160 Haaretz Daily Newspaper Ltd. All Rights Reserved",

To take just one example, the instrument\u2019s affirmation of the right to regulate is meaningless. Of course, the parties have not entirely given up their right to regulate. But the fact is, even if the instrument had full legal force under international law, CETA would still threaten the ability of Canada or EU governments to regulate in the public interest, enhance public services, and hold multinational companies accountable for their actions. \u2018The critical point missing,\u2019 as we wrote previously, \u2018is that while the parties retain the right to regulate, they must do so in conformity with their CETA obligations and commitments.'\u201d So it will be interesting to see if Obama tries a similar deception on TPP. But wait! \nWallonia\u2019s principled stand did, however, produce some important results. While most of the media attention in Canada appears to have focused on the joint instrument, the more interesting and potentially significant development may be the accord between Belgian governments that spells out the grounds for Belgium\u2019s federal government to sign CETA. \nFor example, Belgium will now ask the European Court of Justice to give an opinion on the legality of CETA\u2019s investment court system within the EU. Even more importantly, four of Belgium\u2019s regional governments also state that they reject CETA (notably its investment chapter) as negotiated and that Belgium will refuse to ratify the treaty unless these concerns are addressed. In other words, while Belgium is now in a position to sign CETA, it will not be able to ratify the deal as it stands. \nThis means that CETA\u2019s investment chapter, at a minimum, must be revised or the investment court system scrapped, before CETA can be ratified by Belgium. The accord also includes assurances that if any Belgian regional government refuses to ratify CETA, the federal government must give notice to the EU that Belgium cannot ratify, an act that could potentially trigger the end of CETA\u2019s provisional application in all European member states. \nThe German constitutional court staked out a similar position in the event that Germany fails to ratify CETA. That decision, by the way, will not be made by the German government alone, but in conjunction with Germany\u2019s second chamber, which is currently controlled by the anti-CETA Greens and Left parties. \nSo while CETA proponents have undoubtedly cleared a big albeit unanticipated hurdle in getting the deal signed, their machinations may have made CETA\u2019s full ratification even less likely. CETA\u2019s passage in Europe is far from assured, despite the apparent breakthrough in Belgium. \nAnd then there is the voice of the Canadian establishment\u2013 \nCETA: \u201cCETA puts Canada\u2019s trade debate to rest once and for all\u201d [ Globe and Mail ]. \u201cThe rationale for launching CETA in Canada was in large part to establish a measure of diversification from the country\u2019s trade relations within the North American free-trade agreement. Given the tone around trade in the U.S. presidential election, this decision now looks especially prescient.\u201d \nCETA: \u201cWhat the Canada-EU Deal Means for the Future of Trade\u201d [ Fortune ]. \u201cAll of the factors that drove Europe to conclude this agreement provide insights for current trade challenges in the U.S. President Obama is trying to get Congress to approve just after the presidential election the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement\u2026 Now is the time to resolve as many specific congressional objections to the deal as possible. It is impossible to renegotiate the TPP in the time available, so as with the last-minute negotiations between the EU and Belgium, both the administration and Congress will need to be pragmatic and come to an agreement quickly on outstanding issues.\u201d \nTISA: \u201cThe 21st round of negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement kicks off this morning in Geneva, and stakes are high for significant progress to be made this round in order for the deal to wrap up by its early December deadline. Significant issues remain, including data flows \u2014 where the European Union is still working to come up with a consolidated position \u2014 and new services, on which the EU and others are continuing to push for the right to apply different regulations to domestic and foreign constituents rather than afford the same treatment to all TISA partners.

When did that get crapified, anyhow? \nThe Voters \n\u201c[W]hile Trump and many of his supporters may fetishize a past that is deeply retrograde, liberals and progressives have also demonstrated a troubling tendency to fetishize a future that they presume is on their side. There\u2019s something peculiarly telling about this kind of progress fetishism, which has been conscripted as ideology-of-first-resort for Clintonite New Democrats\u201d [ The Baffer ]. \u201cWhen our historical terrain has effectively focused most of our political energies to differentiating ourselves from the not-woke-enough opponents of progress, we can lose all critical introspection. We can uncritically pass over the fact that, say, liberal multiculturalism can end up being really racist , tolerance of queer sexualities can end up repackaging biologically determinist languages of eugenics, and so on. Moreover, as the rise of the New Democrats has made crystal clear (from Bill and Hillary to Obama), we will dependably base our biggest political choices on our future-focused need to have our place on the right side of history confirmed. So what if that means more drone strikes, deportations, mass incarceration of minorities, destructive free trade agreements, corporate concessions, and financial deregulation? It\u2019s messy \u2018maintaining\u2019 history, after all.\u201d \n\u201cEarly Voting a Poor Predictor of Final Results\u201d [ RealClearPolitics ].

We rate only 40 House races in Lean or Toss Up, and Democrats would need to sweep 35 of them to win control, so Republicans remain overwhelming favorites to hold onto their majority. But there is still plenty of uncertainty about the size of that majority: Democrats could gain anywhere from 5 to 20 seats\u201d [ Cook Political Report ]. \u201d Republican voters have begun coming home to Donald Trump amid the Comey news\u2026 Even if control is not at risk, the ultimate size of the GOP majority matters a great deal, especially to Speaker Paul Ryan. To the extent Republicans lose seats, almost all of the casualties will be swing-district moderates who are more loyal to Ryan than Trump.

Effect on voting? \n\u201c[T]he race between [Clinton and Trump] is now a precise dead heat in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, 46-46 percent. A majority, 55 percent, continues to expect Clinton to win, though that\u2019s down 5 points from its peak last week\u201d [ ABC ]. \u201d Among other results is a gradual collapse in support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, from a peak of 9 percent support in September to just 3 percent now. Jill Stein of the Green Party has 2 percent and has held steady.\u201d Amazingly, Trump now leads on honesty and trustworthiness. Of course, it\u2019s madness to focus on individual polls; RCP\u2019s 4-way average has Clinton up by 1.9, though falling. \n\u201cWith the fallout over the FBI email probe continuing to take up oxygen, Trump has stayed uncharacteristically on message. Campaigning near Philadelphia on Tuesday, the GOP nominee and his running mate focused on the projected 25 percent average increase in premiums for some Affordable Care Act plans, as open enrollment began. Trump let Mike Pence do most of the talking, and the Indiana governor closed his remarks on repealing the law by asking Republicans to \u201ccome home'\u201d [ RealClearPolitics ]. Hitherto, Trump has been the anti-Napoleon, always interrupting his enemy when they are making a mistake. Not so this week (though there are 5 days to go).

The number of free agent voters registering as independent or unaffiliated is soaring, while Republican and Democratic numbers flatline. Independent registrations have jumped since 2008 by 22.3 percent in states that keep registration data by party.

There is hardly any scenario that is too far-fetched. Even if the polls are right and Clinton\u2019s lead translates into an electoral victory, she will be so damaged going into office that her chances of getting anything done will be virtually nil. In this sense alone, Trump\u2019s claim that this scandal is \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d could prove to be true. As an incumbent, Richard Nixon at least had an administration in place when he won re-election in 1972, though it took nearly another two years before he was forced to resign under threat of impeachment.\u201d \n\u201cU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday he believes Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions with her private email server are impeachable offenses should she be elected president\u201d [ Beloit Daily News ]. \u201cJohnson cited 18 U.S. Code 793 (f) and 18 U.S. Code 2071, which have to do with the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to national defense. Johnson honed in on the latter of the two, which reads in part that anyone found to have concealed or removed records \u2018shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,\u2019 Johnson said. \u2018I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.'\u201d In principle, I agree. If a high official can privatize their communications, and then decide what to destroy and what to retain before turning them over to law enforcement, the term \u201cpublic records\u201d becomes literally meaningless. Nixon, deep within his withered and wormy soul, retained a shred of conscience: He didn\u2019t simply destroy the tapes . Clinton would have destroyed the tapes without hesitation; in fact, that\u2019s exactly what she did with \u201cher\u201d\u2014 that is, the public\u2019s \u2014 mail. \n\u201cWisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes Tuesday that there would be a \u2018constitutional crisis\u2019 if Clinton was indicted, and when asked about impeachment, answered, \u2018I think that is something that is speculative in nature. I\u2019m speculating, what I can say is that I think Richard Nixon would have been indicted and he would have been impeached.

But in light of the disparate treatment of the armed Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupiers (who were acquitted of all charges Friday) and the protesters in North Dakota supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in its fight against construction of an oil pipeline, it\u2019s apparent that such weapons are now an effective component of the protester\u2019s toolkit\u201d [Letter to the Editor, Los Angeles Times ]. Well, the difference isn\u2019t that the Malheur occupiers were white, given that the (sadly but mostly) white Occupy movement was treated to a 17-city coordinated paramilitary crackdown orchestrated by Obama\u2019s DHS; the difference is that they were right wing (and white). So the Sioux are both the \u201cwrong\u201d color, and their cause is percieved by the country at large as on the left (though I think the Sioux themselves would reject that framework). \n\u201cWant to Help the Standing Rock Sioux?

                              "text": "Originally appeared at The Nation \ns we approach the final months of the Obama presidency, it\u2019s clear that the \u201cchange\u201d in foreign policy that candidate Obama promised voters has not materialized. His pledges to end the Iraq War, to pursue a nuclear-free world, to improve relations with Russia, to act as an honest broker between Israel and Palestine, and to improve relations with the Arab world have all been left unfulfilled. That his likely successor, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, is to the right of the president on matters of national security is, in a way, an all-too-fitting monument to an era of dashed expectations. \nAs of this writing, more than 5,000 troops are deployed in Iraq and nearly 10,000 in Afghanistan. These deployments run parallel with the dangerously misconceived interventions in Libya and Syria and a counterproductive drone war that stretches from the Maghreb and the Arabian Peninsula to the mountains and plains of Central Asia. Worryingly, the Obama administration has given these military adventures a veneer of legality by deriving justification from the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress on September 14, 2001. These US interventions are supported by nearly 2.1 million reserve and active-duty troops, 200,000 of whom are stationed overseas at a yearly cost of $600 billion. By some estimates, the US military is currently operating in more than 160 countries. \nMeanwhile, in addition to waging a new and more dangerous cold war with Russia, the administration\u2014which views the South China Sea as a core national interest\u2014launched the so-called \u201cAsia pivot,\u201d which moves US policy toward China from one largely based on shared business interests to one that seeks to contain China\u2019s rise. The president\u2019s much-publicized trip to Southeast Asia this year was a good indication that Washington intends to surround and isolate China by employing \u201cbandwagoning\u201d states like Vietnam. \nIt was widely assumed that Obama would pick up the pieces of the Bush years and exorcise hegemonic fantasies from the body politic. Instead, over his two terms in office, the convergence of the neoconservative and Wilsonian interventionist creeds has solidified into orthodoxy. No better evidence of this exists than the fact that the neocons who served as the instigators and defenders of George W. Bush\u2019s foreign policy have become devoted supporters of Hillary Clinton. Robert Kagan, Max Boot, and Eliot Cohen, among others, have all voiced their preference for Clinton over the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. \nThis is less surprising than it might first seem. After all, the neoconservative and Wilsonian weltanschauungs are, like Marxism, teleological: History, for them, has specific and definable ends. For the neocons and Wilsonians (also commonly known, in recent decades, as liberal interventionists), humanity\u2019s march toward democracy is not only in sight, but achievable. America\u2019s foreign-policy orthodoxy can be summed up by the claim made by then\u2013Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, that America is the one \u201cindispensable nation\u201d because \u201cwe stand tall. We see further into the future.\u201d \nObama\u2019s UN ambassador, Samantha Power, expressed well an integral element of this orthodoxy when she recently wrote that \u201cit is now objectively the case that our national interests are increasingly affected not just by what happens between states, but also by how people are treated within states [emphasis added].\u201d \nPower\u2019s casual disregard for the Westphalian principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of other states, now de rigueur among interventionists of both parties, is fused with a belief in American global hegemony, of which the Obama administration\u2019s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review is representative: \nThe United States remains the only nation able to project and sustain large-scale operations over extended distances. This unique position generates an obligation to be responsible stewards of the power and influence that history, determination, and circumstance have provided. \nClearly, change has failed to materialize. Instead, Obama remains firmly in the grip of a foreign-policy orthodoxy that he himself has dismissed as \u201cthe Washington playbook,\u201d and which the scholar Andrew Bacevich describes as the \u201cfaith-based belief in American global primacy to be pursued regardless of how the world may be changing and heedless of costs.\u201d In late October, The Washington Post observed that while \u201cit is not unusual for Washington\u2019s establishment to launch major studies in the final months of an administration,\u201d the flurry of recommendations coming from Washington think tanks like the Center for American Progress \u201creflect a remarkable consensus among the foreign policy elite.\u201d Perhaps the question that will flummox future historians most as they survey the record of the Obama years is this: How did a president who so eloquently and cogently promised a break with the past become captive to the regnant orthodoxy calling for seemingly endless interventions abroad? \nAs it became more and more difficult to deny that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a debacle, George W. Bush tried to justify his administration\u2019s policies by appropriating the language of the Wilsonians in an attempt to make his actions palatable to the guardians of respectable opinion. In his second inaugural address, Bush proclaimed: \u201cIt is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\u201d By employing such language, Bush cleared the way for the convergence of the neoconservative and Wilsonian ideologies, which have now congealed into the orthodoxy holding US foreign policy hostage. \nThat orthodoxy is enforced by what historian William Appleman Williams has described as the \u201cclimate of assumption.\u201d This prevailing climate is shaped by an \u201cinside-outside\u201d dynamic, whereby the narrative that defines any given crisis is set on the \u201cinside,\u201d by administration officials and sitting ambassadors, and reinforced on the \u201coutside,\u201d by the establishment media. What amounts to is a process of preemptive agenda-setting. In the case of policy regarding Syria, Libya, and Russia, the inside-outside dynamic has shaped a narrative that seeks to delegitimize the regimes in question, thereby obviating the need for nuance and crowding out the moral, consequential, or realist implications of any given policy decision. It is therefore exceedingly difficult, even for a chief executive with Obama\u2019s obvious talents, to depart from this orthodoxy, because of the way it narrows the spectrum of \u201cacceptable\u201d policy options. * * * \nThe Obama administration\u2019s counterproductive intervention in Syria stems from an interpretation of the Arab Spring, painted by administration insiders and the establishment media, as a series of peaceful, pro-democracy mass movements. Such movements were deemed deserving of US support because, according to the democratic-peace theory (a key tenet of the neoconservative/Wilsonian ideologies), the spread of democracy is de facto in US interests; as the oft-stated argument goes, democracies don\u2019t wage war against one another. \nThe protests that roiled Syria in the spring of 2011 surely gave voice to elements of the population with legitimate grievances against the Assad regime. But did that necessarily mean that the overthrow of the country\u2019s secular government would serve US national interests\u2014or the interests of the vast majority of Syrians? That question never seems to have been asked, because the orthodoxy deemed it out of bounds. The Syrian narrative was set early on: Bashar al-Assad, an obstacle to democratization and killer of his own people, \u201cmust go.\u201d \nThe pr \nThe narrative of illegitimacy, once established, allows for almost anything, regardless of the legality or morality of the chosen policy. Witness former CIA director David Petraeus\u2019s call for Washington to ally with elements of Al Qaeda in Syria, or the US government\u2019s funding of the Nour al-din al-Zinki movement, which beheaded a 12-year-old boy in July\u2014to say nothing of the CIA\u2019s illegal and counterproductive train-and-equip program, which has only served to prolong the Syrian conflict. \nA similar dynamic played out during the Libyan crisis: Very early on, the president\u2014driven by rumors circulated as fact in the establishment media that Libyan dictator Moammar El-Gadhafi was about to conduct a wholesale massacre in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi\u2014declared that he \u201cmust leave.\u201d The narrative of impending slaughter was reinforced by a spate of breathless news reports and op-eds. \nYet the basis of the administration\u2019s case for intervention proved to be illusory. There was not then, nor is there now, a shred of evidence that Gadhafi intended to unleash a genocidal slaughter in Benghazi. And this was clear at the time: As University of Texas scholar Alan Kuperman pointed out in April 2011, \u201cThe best evidence that Khadafy did not plan genocide in Benghazi is that he did not perpetrate it in the other cities he had recaptured either fully or partially\u2014including Zawiya, Misurata, and Ajdabiya, which together have a population greater than Benghazi.\u201d \nBut no matter: Once the narrative was set, the orthodoxy dictated intervention in spite of the fact, as reported by Rolling Stone in 2011, that Gadhafi\u2019s son Saif \u201ctried to arrange a phone call with Hillary Clinton, thinking he could talk the Americans out of intervening. But when Saif placed the call, Clinton refused to speak to him.\u201d NATO intervened in March 2011, and Gadhafi was dead by October, creating a vacuum that has since been filled by civil war and the rise of ISIS. \nIn the case of Russia, the administration\u2019s call to oust Vladimir Putin has been tacit rather than overt. After Putin\u2019s decision to stand for election in March 2012, the goal of isolating Russia with an eye toward regime change became default US policy. Indeed, in March 2011, the Russian politician Boris Nemtsov wrote that Vice President Joe Biden told a gathering of opposition figures in Moscow that if he were Putin, \u201che would not stand for president in 2012 because this would be bad for the country and for himself.\u201d \nAfter that, the narrative was set: Putin, returning for a third term in the Kremlin, was to be treated as an obstacle to be removed. For proof of this, one need look no further than an e-mail from Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, to a departing aide in February 2012, in which she noted that she was pleased to see the aide heading to the White House to \u201cplan and execute our Russia strategy post-Putin.\u201d \nThe push by inside and outside voices to brand Putin\u2019s Russia as an outlaw state picked up steam in the winter of 2013\u201314, with the start of the Maidan revolution in Ukraine. Recall that the initial cause of the rift between the protesters and the Ukrainian government was over the latter\u2019s failure to sign an association agreement with the European Union. And while US national-security interests weren\u2019t even remotely at stake, that was beside the point: The agreement included trade and security provisions that would have effectively wrenched Ukraine from Russia\u2019s traditional sphere of influence, and it was pursued regardless of the consequences, which have included the violent overthrow of Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected president and a civil war that has killed nearly 10,000 people. By the end of 2015, the United States had provided Ukraine with $2 billion in loan guarantees and nearly $760 million in security assistance\u2014all part of a needless and costly new cold war with Russia that could one day be seen as President Obama\u2019s principal foreign-policy legacy. * * * \nIn addition to the inside-outside dynamic between the administration and establishment media, Washington\u2019s think tanks and NGOs play an important role as enforcers of orthodoxy\u2014one that has become increasingly pronounced over the course of the Obama administration. While purporting to be nonpartisan, outfits like the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) and the Brookings Institution in effect launder neoconservative policy proposals by dressing them up in the softer, more palatable language of Wilsonianism. In just the past few years, think tanks have served as incubators and champions of policies like arming Ukraine and overthrowing the government of Syria. \nOften, these organizations are deeply compromised by their funders. For example, after Brookings accepted $14.8 million from the government of Qatar\u2014which has financed Salafist terrorist groups like Syria\u2019s Nusra Front (now the Levant Conquest Front)\u2014the think tank published an op-ed that made the case for Syria\u2019s radical Sunni extremist group Ahrar al-Sham, arguing against \u201cdesignating [it] as a terrorist organization.\u201d \nWashi \nAnalysts associated with Brookings and its center in Qatar\u2014whose co-chair is Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, a former prime minister and member of the Qatari ruling family\u2014have repeatedly complained that the Obama administration isn\u2019t doing enough to help the \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition in Syria. And yet Gerd M\u00fcller, Germany\u2019s international-development minister, told The Telegraph in 2014, \u201cYou have to ask who is arming, who is financing [ISIS] troops. The keyword there is Qatar.\u201d Indeed, it has recently come to light that Hillary Clinton shared M\u00fcller\u2019s concerns, noting in an August 2014 e-mail to John Podesta that the Qatari and Saudi governments \u201care providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.\u201d \nThis June, while Democratic Representative (and combat veteran) Tulsi Gabbard was pushing a bill to defund the CIA\u2019s train-and-equip program in Syria, Brookings senior fellow Shadi Hamid took to Twitter to declare that \u201c@TulsiGabbard might be one of worst/least knowledgeable foreign policy thinkers in Democratic party. Not just bad ideas, but dangerous ones.\u201d Hamid followed this up with: \u201cNeo-isolationist left (@tulsigabbard) & far right (Trump) have pretty similar views on how Putin\u2019s actually not so bad: He can help on ISIS!\u201d \nIn smearing Gabbard, Hamid was only echoing the sentiments of his colleague in Qatar, Charles Lister, who had previously accused Gabbard of being \u201cthe Democratic Party\u2019s chief defender of Bashar al-#Assad.\u201d As Brookings fellows, Hamid and Lister take their role as enforcers of the orthodoxy seriously\u2014as well they might, since Gabbard\u2019s legislation, if passed, would be a serious setback for the grand designs of Beltway Caesars like themselves. \nIn addition to plumping for further involvement in Syria, Hamid has tried to whitewash the administration\u2019s disastrous Libya intervention, which even Obama has admitted was his \u201cworst mistake.\u201d Hamid, though, claims it was \u201csuccessful,\u201d arguing: \u201cThe country is better off today than it would have been had the international community allowed dictator Muammar Qaddafi to continue his rampage across the country.\u201d Never mind that a civil war has been ravaging Libya for the past five years. \nIn addition to producing op-ed columns of questionable value, think tanks also influence the climate of assumption by publishing special reports that are meant to serve as guides for policy-makers. Indeed, sometimes the resemblance between government memoranda and think-tank literature is uncanny, as was the case this past June when CNAS Middle East director Ilan Goldenberg was pleased to point out the \u201cmany similarities\u201d between the State Department\u2019s hawkish \u201cdissent channel\u201d cable on Syria and a CNAS report titled \u201cDefeating the Islamic State: A Bottom-Up Approach.\u201d Both, needless to say, called for greater US involvement in the Syrian civil war. \nIn the past year, CNAS has published several notable reports that have advocated, among other things, the wider use of drones ( \u201cThe Promise of Unmanned Systems in the Asia Pacific\u201d ); increased military spending and more overseas commitments ( \u201cExtending American Power: Strategies to Expand U.S. Engagement in a Competitive World Order\u201d ); directly arming the Syrian opposition ( \u201cFrom the Bottom, Up: A Strategy for U.S. Military Support to Syria\u2019s Armed Opposition\u201d ); and yet more military spending ( \u201cWhile We Can: Arresting the Erosion of America\u2019s Military Edge\u201d ). Even the ostensibly center-left Center for American Progress recently unveiled a report that urged the imposition of a no-fly zone over Syria, a move that Hillary Clinton herself has admitted, albeit behind closed doors, risks the possibility of a wider war and would \u201ckill lots of Syrians.\u201d \nMeanwhile, the Atlantic Council (funded in part by the US government and NATO) has released a series of articles and reports urging greater action in Ukraine. In February 2015, in conjunction with Brookings and the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, it released \u201cPreserving Ukraine\u2019s Independence, Resisting Russian Aggression: What the United States and NATO Must Do,\u201d which urged the administration to arm Kiev. \nOver the past few years, the Atlantic Council has gone from espousing a sensible, if staid, transatlanticism to producing some of the most virulent specimens of the new cold-war propaganda. Examples of its prodigious output relating to Russia and the Ukraine crisis can be seen in reports like \u201cHuman Rights Abuses in Russia-Occupied Crimea\u201d (August 2015); \u201cHiding in Plain Sight: Putin\u2019s War in Ukraine\u201d (October 2015); and \u201cArming for Deterrence\u201d (July 2016). Not surprisingly, in addition to NATO and the US government, the Atlantic Council lists the Ukrainian World Congress, the Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk, the Lithuanian government, and the Latvian embassy among its many funders. \nThere is also the collusion between private, ostensibly nongovernmental organizations and those agencies of the US government that seek\u2014and sometimes, in the case of Ukraine, manage to engineer\u2014regime-change movements. The founding father of what might be called \u201cideological humanitarianism\u201d is surely the financier and self-styled political philosopher George Soros, who, through his network of Open Society Foundations, seeks to influence and leverage civil-society opposition groups in countries throughout Eastern Europe. \n\n\nSoros has spawned many imitators. Perhaps the most emblematic of the new techno-crusaders is eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, whose involvement in the Ukraine uprising has complemented Washington\u2019s. According to journalist Mark Ames, \u201cThe American government\u2014in the form of the US Agency for International Development (USAID)\u2014played a major role in funding opposition groups prior to the revolution.\u201d Ames also notes that a large percentage of the funding for those groups came from Omidyar. \nIndeed, Omidyar\u2019s work has been praised by none other than Samantha Power, who, in November 2013, singled him out as an heir to Soros in a speech hailing the \u201cnew philanthropists\u201d who are working to advance the vision that \u201cGeorge popularized and resourced: open economy, open government, open society.\u201d And while it\u2019s certainly the case that the Open Society Foundations have done valuable work in the fields of public health and criminal-justice reform, particularly here in the United States, Soros\u2019s activism takes on a decidedly less benign character abroad. A recent tranche of leaked Open Society e-mails shows that Soros was actively trying to shape the politics of post-Maidan Ukraine. In a meeting with US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt in March 2014, Soros urged Washington to provide \u201cprofessional PR assistance to [the] Ukrainian government,\u201d while also voicing his opinion that the neofascist group Right Sector was little more than \u201can FSB [Federal Security Service] plot\u201d funded by Russia \u201cto destabilize Ukraine.\u201d * * * \nThe US government, in appointing itself the global arbiter of legitimacy, has set a series of dangerous precedents. Today, the United States reserves the right to intervene anywhere in the world, regardless of the consequences, morality, or costs in blood and treasure. In the Middle East, US interventions have created space for ISIS in Iraq, Syria, and Libya, while our alleged allies Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar have been among the principal benefactors of ISIS and like-minded religious extremists. \nIn addition to what is fast becoming a strange obsession with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the foreign-policy establishment has turned a blind eye to the ravages of the Ukrainian civil war, as well as to the fact that the main\u2014and perhaps insuperable\u2014obstacle to the implementation of the 2014 Minsk cease-fire agreement is the US-supported and -funded government in Kiev, which boasts a neo-Nazi as its parliamentary speaker. \nAs we approach November 8, it is clear that this foreign-policy orthodoxy is something the establishment takes on faith. But foreign policy should not be a faith-based business. Progressives and like-minded anti-interventionist conservatives and libertarians need to alert the American public to this dangerous state of affairs and fashion a coherent, sound, and popular alternative to the orthodoxy holding US foreign policy hostage. That may require the formation of a 21st-century peace movement, with allies inside a \u201cpeace\u201d wing of the Democratic Party. A second Clinton administration looks increasingly likely; if that is the case, the progressive, responsible left will have to serve as a check on its interventionist impulses. This will not be easy, nor should we delude ourselves about the prospects for success. \nBut we must, for all our sakes, attempt it.",

                              "text": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at a Capitol Hill news conference, January 19, 2018. (Reuters photo: Yuri Gripas)  Her brand is toxic and taints everyone in her party.  This should be a big year for Democrats. With Republicans sagging under the weight of an unpopular incumbent president, an often-dysfunctional administration, and the burden of controlling both houses of Congress while getting relatively little done, the 2018 midterms promise huge gains for the out-of-power party.  But there are still two grounds for a degree of optimism in the GOP.  One is that a booming economy encouraged by President Trump\u2019s deregulation policy and the tax-reform package passed in December may serve to overcome voter dissatisfaction with the president and the Republicans.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The other is House minority leader Nancy Pelosi.  Opposition to Pelosi was a rallying cry in both 2010 and 2014 as the GOP used her as a symbol of everything voters hate about the Democrats. She led a liberal Congress that had imposed an unpopular Obamacare bill on the nation without, as she famously admitted, knowing what was actually in the bill. An aging machine politician who has always been primarily focused on fundraising and keeping close to special interests that are key to her party\u2019s bankroll, she also represented the kind of old-style, cynical politics that 21st-century voters hate.  Advertisement  For a party that is in desperate need of a makeover in the aftermath of a shocking 2016 defeat that left Republicans in charge of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, replacing Pelosi with someone more in touch with the party\u2019s base and less likely to offset the unpopularity of the Republicans should have been a no-brainer. But Pelosi survived that loss just as she did the epic shellackings of 2010 and 2014. More than that, she has every intention of returning to the speaker\u2019s chair she relinquished to John Boehner in January 2011. As her near-record filibuster of the House prior to the vote on a spending bill to keep the government open indicated, she is prepared to embrace the challenge of being the face of the Democrats\u2019 attempt to take back control of Congress.  Though it\u2019s not clear that anything Pelosi does or says can possibly be as much of a handicap to the Democrats as some of Trump\u2019s ill-advised statements or tweets might be to the GOP, her conduct in recent weeks is giving Republicans hope.  Advertisement  While still the fundraising dynamo keeping her party\u2019s coffers full and placing many, if not most, of her members in her debt, Pelosi is a gift that doesn\u2019t stop giving for the GOP.  Pelosi\u2019s over-the-top denunciation of the tax-reform bill, in which she more or less guaranteed it would ruin the country as well as the Republicans, was a problem. But what made it worse was when she dismissed the real benefits to middle-class taxpayers of a $1,000 cut as \u201ccrumbs.\u201d In that moment she validated Trump\u2019s putdown of her as a \u201crich woman who lives in a big, beautiful house in California who wants to give all of your money away.\u201d While not quite as bad as Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of the term \u201cdeplorables\u201d to put down Trump voters, \u201ccrumbs\u201d will serve the GOP nicely as a cudgel with which to slam the Democrats as limousine liberals.  Advertisement  Just as damaging was the clumsy double game she played on the spending bill. She was part of the Democratic team that negotiated a deal with the Republicans to keep the government functioning. But she rejected the outcome of the talks, preferring instead to keep her word to her party\u2019s left wing that she would not accept any solution that did not provide relief for the Dreamers \u2014 illegal immigrants brought into the country as minors. Her lengthy rant on the House floor was a demonstration of her willingness to bow to the Democratic base. But as soon as the spending bill was passed with substantial help from Democrats who rejected Pelosi\u2019s stand, the minority leader turned on a dime and said it was a great deal.  Those sorts of shenanigans mark her as the ultimate old-school politician but also make clear how out of touch she is with the voters. Party dissidents such as Ohio representative Tim Ryan keep telling the Democrats they need to present the voters with fresher faces than a House leadership team of Pelosi, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, and Assistant Leader James Clyburn \u2014 77, 78, and 77 years of age respectively \u2014 but Pelosi and the others have no intention of giving way.  Even if few on the left or in the center like Pelosi, the party appears to be stuck with her.  Ryan is right that Pelosi\u2019s willingness to put the interests of the Dreamers over those of the country and to prioritize that kind of identity politics over economic issues is not a formula for success in the states that are not already in the Democrats\u2019 column. But, as with the GOP, the base rules the Democratic party, and even if few on the left or in the center like Pelosi, the party appears to be stuck with her. With favorability numbers that are even worse than Trump\u2019s, Pelosi is a liability to her party. The question is, how much of a liability?  While it was possible for Republicans to make the 2010 midterms a referendum on Pelosi and Obama, it\u2019s hard to imagine a House minority leader, even one as unpopular as Pelosi, having as much of an impact on the election as a president who is as deeply underwater as Trump (even after a bump in the polls in the last few weeks).  Advertisement  Advertisement  Yet as she demonstrated last week, Pelosi doesn\u2019t seem to understand that the best way to return to the speakership is for her to maintain as low a profile as possible. Pelosi hurts Democrats by depressing their base, which views her as a pillar of the establishment, while giving Republicans a reminder of what they hate about Democrats even if they can\u2019t stand their own party lately.  Pelosi\u2019s partisans accuse Republicans of bullying and demagoguing her, but the truth is that her brand is toxic and taints everyone in her party.

In addition, the e-mail contained multiple links to the Wikipedia entry for Social Security and line graphs of Ronald Reagan's year-by-year approval ratings.\n\nBecause Obama copied and pasted some critical passages directly from right-wing editorials and personal blogs, the e-mail included formatting irregularities that caused many citizens to receive a message in which all of the apostrophes were replaced with question marks. Moreover, some software flagged it as spam.\n\n\"I don?t mean to be rude, but I thought we were all on the samepage about helath care reform,\" the 29th paragraph of Obama's e-mail read in part. \"It was part of my platform. You all knew I was goingt o pursue it when you elected me. And just real fast, going back on what I said earlier, the economic stimulus cut taxes for 95% of Americans. It didn't raise them. It cut them. You people need to look at facts and stop litnening to all the right wing crap out there. By the way, we're basically out of Iraq now. You?re welcome.\"\n\n\"JESUS CHRIST, WE LOST OVER @ MILLION JOBS BEFOREE I EVEN TOOK OFFICE!!!11!\" reads a sentence occupying a large white space between two massive chunks of texts, one of which was a 6,500-word tangent on the Muslim community center being built two blocks from the former World Trade Center site.\n\nAccording to White House sources, Obama \"snapped\" late Tuesday afternoon when a staffer reminded him he was scheduled to take a call from incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner. At that point, a visibly disgusted Obama was observed slowly repeating the words \"House Speaker Boehner\" before ordering everyone to leave the Oval Office, where he sat typing and, according to some, banging angrily on his keyboard for the next five hours.\n\nWhen White House Chief of Staff Pete Rouse urged the president to sleep on the e-mail, Obama told him he had already sent it.\n\n\"In terms of fulfilling campaign promises I think I've actually done a pretty good job in terms of fulfilling campaign,\" Obama wrote in response to an anonymous comment made to a post by conservative blogger Michelle Malkin. \"I know I said I'd close Guantanamo and I sti5ill want to do that but it's harder than it looks. And yes I know I said it would be done by now along with energy reform too\u2014-trust me it is still a priority because \"TOGETHER WE CAN & MUST EMBRACE CLEAN ENERGY\"\"\n\n\"Yes we can!\" the e-mail concluded. \"Ugh, you know what? Forget it. Believe what you want. Yours, Barack.\"\n\nThus far the response from the American public has been subdued, though a sixth of the populace did not even receive the e-mail because the message generated 50 million mailer-daemon delivery failure notifications.\n\n",

                              "text": "(CNN) A majority of cannabis dispensaries in Colorado recommended their products to women posing as pregnant customers with morning sickness, clashing with doctors' warnings about the potential harms, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.  Of 400 randomly selected dispensaries in Colorado, about seven in 10 recommended cannabis products as a treatment for morning sickness. Nearly two-thirds of the employees who answered these calls based these recommendations on \"personal opinion,\" and more than a third said cannabis was safe during pregnancy. Roughly 32% of employees recommended the caller talk to a health care provider without the caller having to bring it up herself.  \"I was really surprised,\" said study author Dr. Torri Metz , a high-risk obstetrician at Denver Health in Colorado, where marijuana was legalized in 2012. \"I did not expect dispensaries to be recommending cannabis products to pregnant women.\"  Metz said women seek information on cannabis use during pregnancy from a variety of sources beyond their doctors -- including the internet, friends and family.  \"Women are hesitant to disclose any kind of drug use in pregnancy to their health care providers for fear of potential legal ramifications or involvement by social services,\" she said.  Experts worry that some of these women may seek advice from cannabis retailers, expecting that they have specialized knowledge on the drug's safety during pregnancy.  In the study, medical dispensaries were more likely to recommend cannabis products than retail dispensaries: About 83% and 60% did so, respectively. The authors note that the employees they spoke to may not reflect the official policy of a given dispensary.  Dr. Katrina Mark , an OB-GYN who was not involved in the research, wrote in an email that the term \"medical dispensary\" is a \"misnomer.\"  \"They are only licensed to dispense to people who have medical marijuana cards,\" said Mark, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences. \"This does not mean that they are staffed by people that have any sort of medical education .\"  Doctors' orders  Doctors caution that the health effects of cannabis on a fetus remain unclear but could include low birth weight and developmental problems, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In animal studies, the active ingredient THC has been shown to cross the placenta, and researchers have suggested that it could cause \"irreversible, subtle dysfunctions in the offspring.\"  Still, experts say the science is still in progress, and human studies are primarily observational: \"It is unethical to purposely expose women and their unborn babies to marijuana during pregnancy to study outcomes,\" Mark said.  \"Marijuana in pregnancy is ... not as black and white as something like alcohol,\" she added.  Though some dispensary employees did not make a recommendation in Metz's study, some claimed that eating versus smoking cannabis products could make their products safer. Others recommended that the women not broach the subject with their doctors.  \"Google it first. Then if you feel apprehensive about it, you could ask,\" one employee told a researcher who posed as a pregnant customer.  \"Maybe you have a progressive doctor that will not lie to you. All the studies done back in the day were just propaganda,\" another employee said.  \"It was hard to hear that, being a health care provider,\" Metz said of employees' unproven safety claims and recommendations that women not ask their doctors about it.  Metz and her colleagues wrote that there are no regulations in Colorado surrounding what recommendations and advice dispensaries can give to customers. Cannabis products in the state are, however, required to be labeled as follows: \"There may be additional health risks associated with the consumption of this product for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning on becoming pregnant.\"  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that \"women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy should be encouraged to discontinue marijuana use\" and \"to discontinue use of marijuana for medicinal purposes in favor of an alternative therapy.\"  Additionally, \"there are insufficient data to evaluate the effects of marijuana use on infants during lactation and breastfeeding, and in the absence of such data, marijuana use is discouraged,\" according to the recommendations.  The journal in which the new study appeared is the official publication of the organization.  Metz said she hopes this study will \"engage the cannabis industry ... in really coming together in terms of what the reasonable message should be providing to pregnant women.\"  \"I think that the majority of women are really trying to do the right thing for their pregnancy and for their baby,\" she added. \"I just think we need to get that information to their hands.\"  Overstepping boundaries  There are conventional medications for morning sickness that are considered safe for pregnancy, such as vitamin B6 and doxylamine , an antihistamine sold under brands like Unisom. For some women, eating small, frequent meals and staying hydrated can help, Mark said.

A whopping 69 percent of all dispensaries contacted recommended the use of cannabis as a means to treat morning sickness. However, the recommendations for cannabis products varied by license type.

It\u2019s caused by an infection with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is one of multiple coronaviruses that can be transmitted to humans. Other examples of coronaviruses include SARS, MERS, and even the common cold. COVID-19 cases Globally, there have been more than 20.1 million confirmed cases and over 738,000 associated deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. The United States currently has the highest reported number of confirmed cases with more than 5.1 million. However, due to a lack of testing, the number of actual cases may be far higher. More than 164,000 people in the United States have died from the disease and over 45,000 are currently hospitalized. Healthline will update this page every weekday. For more information about the virus, go here. Russia says they will start administering COVID-19 vaccine despite lack of evidence Despite not finishing vital medical trials, the Russian government said they will start administering a COVID-19 vaccine this fall, according to the New York Times. The government hasn\u2019t reported data from vital phase 3 trials where tens of thousands of people are given either the vaccine or placebo. Those trials are critical for verifying that a vaccine or medication is effective and for identifying potential side effects. Health experts in the United States said they\u2019re concerned that the vaccine could cause more mistrust in vaccines in general or give people a false sense of security. Dr. Scott Gottleib, the former FDA commissioner, said that the news may be part of a Russian effort to undermine or cast doubt on a vaccine approved in the United States. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t take it certainly outside the clinical trial right now,\u201d Gottlieb said on CNBC. He also pointed out that a similar vaccine being tested in Canada hasn\u2019t seen very promising results and that it\u2019s not clear how effective this Russian vaccine is. Tweet Nearly 100,000 children test positive for COVID-19 in just 2 weeks A major study found a significant number of children have tested positive for COVID-19 in just a couple of weeks. Over 97,000 children tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 2 weeks of July, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association. This marks a 40 percent increase in pediatric cases. In total, more than 338,000 children have contracted COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The AAP report was released as many school districts around the country grapple with starting the new school year. Some school districts in places like California and Chicago have said they will start school remotely. Others are planning to have at least some students return to the classroom. In Georgia, where classes have resumed in some districts, at least 9 COVID-19 cases have been reported in a school district that reopened last week. When children develop COVID-19 they appear to have fewer severe symptoms than adults. However, they\u2019re not immune to the virus and can spread the disease to other more vulnerable people. Additionally, children can have serious and even severe symptoms of the virus. While rare, some children have died after developing COVID-19. Share on Pinterest N.Y. governor says nation\u2019s largest school district can reopen Governor Andrew Cuomo announced August 7 that New York public schools can reopen if they\u2019re in an area where the testing positivity rate is below 5 percent. This means that public schools in New York City, the largest school district in the nation, could potentially reopen. While New York was the original epicenter for COVID-19 in the United States, it now has some of the lowest infection rates in the country. While Cuomo allowed schools to take steps to reopen, school districts will ultimately decide whether or not to reopen. They will then need to submit reopening plans to the state to get the final approval. Tweet School reopenings in Georgia have already run into issues after some students and staff tested positive for COIVD-19 leading to more quarantines. Model predicts nearly 300,000 deaths from COVID-19 in US by December 1 A model to predict the spread of COVID-19 now estimates the related death toll could surpass 295,000 in the United States by the end of the year. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), an independent global health research center at the University of Washington, has been analyzing data from the COVID-19 pandemic for months. Their model\u2019s projections for the number of COVID-19 fatalities has changed over time as the disease initially waned and then surged when states reopened this summer. Now with the disease widespread in much of the country, their estimated death toll is over 295,000 by December 1. This projection could change again if more people adopt social distancing measures and wear masks. Los Angeles may cut off water and power to houses that host parties during pandemic Mayor Eric Garcetti said officials may cut off water and power to houses if they see they\u2019re hosting large gatherings in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Garcetti said the order wouldn\u2019t target small gatherings but places that have hosted large gatherings multiple times. \u201cThese are focused on the people determined to break the rules, posing significant public dangers and a threat to all of us,\u201d Garcetti said during a COVID-19 news conference, according to CNN. Television news crews shot footage of a large party in the Hollywood Hills earlier this week and officials said it wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Additionally, county health officials said they\u2019re also investigating a potential superspreader event linked to three fraternities at the University of Southern California. Los Angeles has been dealing with a surge in COVID-19 cases in recent months. Los Angeles County has nearly 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases and over 4,800 related deaths. School in Georgia reports COVID-19 case after reopening One day after reopening for the new academic year, a school in Georgia is disinfecting a classroom after a second-grade student tested positive for COVID-19. The student\u2019s class and teacher are currently quarantined and the school is being cleaned, according to NBC News. The infection shows how difficult school reopenings are likely to be as COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States. While many school districts don\u2019t start the school year until later this month or September, schools in parts of Georgia have already reopened. The reopened schools have already made headlines. A photo of a crowded hallway in a high school went viral on social media this week as it showed few students wearing masks. Share on Pinterest Parents are trying to figure out how to send kids back to school safely. Getty Images States want federal government to make COVID-19 treatment more affordable California State Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Lousiana State Attorney General Jeff Landry are asking the federal government to step in and lower the cost for the COVID-19 treatment remdesivir. The drug remdesivir is an antiviral and one of only a few treatments for COVID-19 that appears to decrease mortality. The drug is produced by Gilead Pharmaceutical and is priced at about $3,200 per treatment. Becerra and Landry want the federal government to get involved and license remdesivir to third party pharmaceutical companies in order to increase access and affordability. Under the Bayh\u2013Dole Act, the NIH and FDA are allowed to step in and ensure affordable access to a drug like remdesivir in an emergency. \u201cAmericans ill from COVID-19 should have options in their medical treatment, and today\u2019s petition will hopefully ensure they can access and afford remdesivir,\u201d said Landry in a statement. \u201cDespite millions and millions of taxpayer-funded assistance, Gilead has neither established a reasonable price nor met the health and safety needs of the public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo our bipartisan coalition is calling on the federal government to exercise its rights to help increase the supply of remdesivir and lower its price.\u201d Share on Pinterest COVID-19 outbreak found on cruise ship in the arctic A Norwegian cruise line is reporting an outbreak of COVID-19 on a ship currently north of the Arctic circle. The Hurtigruten cruise line reported that there are at least 41 people with COVID-19 on ship MS Roald Amundsen. The ship is currently far north in Norway. According to CBS News, there have been 36 crew members and 5 passengers who developed COVID-19. However, since the ship stopped at multiple ports in the far northern region of Norway, authorities are concerned that the virus could have been spread at multiple sites. They\u2019re asking anyone who was in contact with people onboard the ship to reach out to local authorities. Share on Pinterest Deborah Birx says COVID-19 is \u2018extraordinarily widespread\u2019 in U.S. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, told CNN on Sunday, August 2, that the COVID-19 pandemic has reached a new phase in the country with rural areas being affected in addition to urban areas. \u201cTo everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not immune or protected from this virus,\u201d Birx said on CNN. \u201cIf you\u2019re in multi-generational households, and there\u2019s an outbreak in your rural area or in your city, you need to really consider wearing a mask at home, assuming that you\u2019re positive, if you have individuals in your households with comorbidities.\u201d Birx also said the virus was \u201cextraordinarily widespread\u201d and that schools shouldn\u2019t open if they\u2019re in states where the testing positivity rate is over 5 percent. Sleepaway camp for kids the site of major COVID-19 outbreak The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Friday that a sleepaway camp for kids and teens became the site of a major COVID-19 outbreak, showing again that the disease can spread even among young people. In the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , CDC researchers reported a COVID-19 outbreak in Georgia at an overnight camp. Nearly 600 camp counselors and campers attended the camp at the end of June. The camp had adhered to state rules designed to limit outbreaks, including mandatory negative COVID-19 tests for campers and counselors. But while counselors had mask requirements, campers weren\u2019t required to wear them. Of the 597 campers and counselors present, at least 260 developed COVID-19. Camp counselors were most likely to contract the virus. The researchers reported that this is another sign that the disease can spread among children, even if they are asymptomatic. \u201cThese findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 spread efficiently in a youth-centric overnight setting, resulting in high attack rates among persons in all age groups, despite efforts by camp officials to implement most recommended strategies to prevent transmission,\u201d the research authors wrote. \u201cAsymptomatic infection was common and potentially contributed to undetected transmission, as has been previously reported,\u201d they said. Children may carry 100 times as much virus as adults A new study out this week found that children may carry far more viral material in their nose and throat than adults. The study , published in JAMA Pediatrics, looked at nasal swabs from children and adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The researchers found children had as much viral material in their swabs as adults \u2014 and sometimes up to 100 times more. While other studies have found that very young children are less likely to spread the virus that causes COVID-19, this new research shows that these children are still very much at risk for spreading the disease. Experts say these findings should be another factor that\u2019s considered as the debate on opening schools continues. \u201cThe school situation is so complicated \u2014 there are many nuances beyond just the scientific one,\u201d Dr. Taylor Heald-Sargent, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago, who led the study, told the New York Times. \u201cBut one takeaway from this is that we can\u2019t assume that just because kids aren\u2019t getting sick, or very sick, that they don\u2019t have the virus.\u201d Herman Cain dies due complications from COVID-19 Former presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after being hospitalized for COVID-19.

Getty Images \u201cHerman Cain \u2014 our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us \u2014 has passed away,\u201d Calabrese wrote. \u201cWe knew when he was first hospitalized with COVID-19 that this was going to be a rough fight.\u201d \u201cHe had trouble breathing and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. We all prayed that the initial meds they gave him would get his breathing back to normal, but it became clear pretty quickly that he was in for a battle,\u201d continued Calabrese. Cain\u2019s death has put a spotlight on political rallies after he attended President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa which didn\u2019t require attendees to wear a mask. Cain was photographed at the event without a mask, but it\u2019s unclear if he developed the disease while at the rally. Cain, the former CEO of the Godfather pizza chain, made headlines when he ran for president in 2012. He was 74 years old. Texas congressman tests positive for COVID-19 after not wearing mask Rep. Louis Gohmert has tested positive for COVID-19 according to his office. Gohmert, a Republican congressman from Texas, was supposed to fly with President Donald Trump on Wednesday when he tested positive. The congressman had told CNN in the past that he didn\u2019t wear a mask because he was being tested regularly. According to Politico, Gohmert has been attending meetings in the capital without a mask. Yesterday he was filmed without a mask at a congressional hearing with Attorney General William Barr. Wearing a mask is increasingly shown to be an effective way to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

Cases are on the upswing in Belgium, France, Germany, and Spain according to the Washington Post. Some countries are pulling back again after reopening. In Spain, nightclubs and gyms are closed in Barcelona and a popular beach is also being closed. In France, the government is now mandating that everyone wear face masks while in shops or indoor venues. The Belgium Prime Minister has now outlined a variety of new measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. These include limiting contact to people outside your home to only 5 other households.

Study finds evidence that drug for autoimmune issues may help fight COVID-19 symptoms A new study finds evidence that a drug originally designed to treat autoimmune diseases and types of lymphoma may help treat COVID-19. Published in the journal Nature , the study found that the drug called LAM-002A may help stop the virus that causes COVID-19 from replicating. The study looked at infected cells in a lab so further tests need to be done in people to see if the drug is an effective way to combat COVID-19. According to a press release by Yale University, the drug may also be combined with remdesivir to treat COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccine trial in US reaches critical phase 3 A major vaccine trial is underway in the United States with researchers planning on involving at least 30,000 participants. Those involved in the study will be divided into two groups with one group getting the experimental vaccine candidate and another group getting a placebo. According to CNN, people who are part of the trial will get two doses of either the vaccine candidate or the placebo over 28 days to see how their immune system reacts. A phase 3 trial is designed to verify that a medication or vaccine is effective, safe, and find out its effective dosage. The vaccine has been developed by Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This trial is just one of at least 2 dozen going on globally in the hunt to find an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Despite the early good news about a potential COVID-19 vaccine, it is possible this vaccine will not be approved for use. In the past, many drugs can appear effective in phase 1 or 2 trials only to be found ineffective or dangerous in phase 3 trials. Share on Pinterest Experts urge second shutdown in U.S. as COVID-19 cases climb Over 100 medical experts signed an open letter urging U.S. government leaders to shut down the country in an effort to stop COVID-19 cases and deaths. The letter, posted by the U.S. PIRG (Public Interest Research Groups), cited climbing COVID-19 cases in multiple states as a reason to shut down again. According to the authors, without another shutdown it will be extremely difficult to stop the virus. \u201cWe need that protocol in place until case numbers recede to a level at which we have the capacity to effectively test and trace,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThen, and only then, we can try a little more opening, one small step at a time.\u201d The authors said much more testing is needed to reopen safely. \u201cWe currently have only 35 percent of the testing capacity we need to meet that threshold. The more people get sick, the more testing is required,\u201d they wrote. Additionally, they point out more contact tracers are needed to determine who has been exposed to the virus. They also said that more personal protective equipment (PPE) is needed to safeguard medical professionals. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take these actions, the consequences will be measured in widespread suffering and death,\u201d the authors wrote. COVID-19 cases top 4 million in US The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage in the United States with no clear end in sight. The number of U.S. people who have tested positive for COVID-19 has now reached over 4 million. July has seen a serious surge in positive COVID-19 tests. While it took months from the start of the outbreak to hit 3 million COVID-19 cases, the last 1 million took just over 2 weeks. States across the country are recording record daily highs of hospitalizations and deaths. The United States currently has the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Brazil, which has about two-thirds of the U.S. population, comes in second for COVID-19 cases and deaths. That country has documented over 2.2 million COVID-19 and over 82,000 deaths. Poll finds 3 out of 4 Americans support mask requirements A new poll from the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that a large majority \u2014 or about 3 out of 4 Americans \u2014 support requiring people to wear masks while outside. The study results come as the United States is seeing new record high cases of COVID-19. The country is nearing 4 million cases with over 140,000 deaths. While mask wearing has become politicized, the study found that the majority of both Democrats (83 percent) and Republicans (58 percent) support mask requirements. A vast majority of Americans \u2014 about 95 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of Republicans \u2014 say they\u2019re donning face coverings when they leave their home. Health authorities have supported wearing facial coverings like masks to slow the spread of COVID-19. Share on Pinterest Some cities may have to shut down again as COVID-19 spreads. Getty Images Red Cross running low on convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients The American Red Cross announced July 22 that they\u2019re running out of vital convalescent plasma used to treat people with COVID-19. The plasma is taken from people who have already recovered from the illness and have crucial antibodies that can help fight the virus. With the surge in COVID-19 cases in the United States, the Red Cross says there\u2019s more demand for the plasma than supply. \u201cIt is critical that COVID-19 survivors give their antibody-rich plasma now to ensure this blood product is available to help those actively battling this coronavirus,\u201d Dr. Pampee Young, chief medical officer of American Red Cross Biomedical Services said in a statement. \u201cConvalescent plasma has been used for decades as a potentially lifesaving treatment until virus or disease specific treatments and vaccines are developed,\u201d Young continued. \u201cIt remains crucially important today in the fight against this COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d A lack of testing access has compounded the plasma shortage. If people are unable to be tested when they have the disease, they may not be able to donate plasma after they recover. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 and want to donate plasma can learn more about the process here. Over 100,000 people volunteer to take part in COVID-19 vaccine trials In just 2 weeks, at least 138,000 people have volunteered to be studied in COVID-19 vaccine trials, according to Forbes. The National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) put out a call this month for volunteers to take part in vaccine trials this fall. At least 120,000 people are needed to take part in four different vaccine trials that will examine the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. \u201cWhile this early response is very gratifying, it is important to note that this is just a fraction of the number of people needed to participate in various trials and ensure adequate representation of various demographic categories,\u201d a spokesperson for the NIAID told Forbes.

Getty Images Actual COVID-19 rate may be 10 times higher than current number A study published July 21 in JAMA Internal Medicine found evidence that the number of Americans who have developed COVID-19 may be 10 times higher than the reported number. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined samples from over 1,600 people in multiple states to look for signs of COVID-19 antibodies. Researchers found the percentage of people with COVID-19 antibodies ranged widely from state to state with nearly 7 percent of people in New York having antibodies while only 1 percent of people in San Francisco having them. Researchers estimate that the actual number of COVID-19 cases is likely 10 times higher than the recorded number, which may be due to people with mild or no symptoms. \u201cThe findings may reflect the number of persons who had mild or no illness or who did not seek medical care or undergo testing but who still may have contributed to ongoing virus transmission in the population,\u201d the study authors wrote. Additionally, many people with symptoms have been unable to get tested for the disease due to a lack of supplies. Researchers investigate potential new treatment for COVID-19 A new study published July 20 found that a commonly available treatment may help people with COVID-19 recover. The treatment is interferon beta, a type of protein that\u2019s traditionally used to treat people with multiple sclerosis. In the UK-based study, researchers had people with COVID-19 inhale the interferon beta. The researchers reportedly found that people who were given the treatment had a 79 percent decreased chance of dying or having severe COVID-19. However, experts caution that the study was small with only 101 people involved. Additionally, researchers haven\u2019t released full data, which has drawn criticism from experts, according to the New York Times. Another study is being planned for the United States with around 400 participants. Share on Pinterest At least 49 Florida hospitals are out of ICU beds The COVID-19 surge has led to Florida hospitals running out of room to treat patients. At least 49 hospitals in Florida have run out of room in their ICUs, according to a state database. As hospitals run out of ICU space, patients will have to be transferred to other facilities around the state or even out of state for treatment. The situation doesn\u2019t look likely to improve in the coming days or weeks. In just the last 5 days, Florida has reported more than 10,000 positive COVID-19 cases every day. The state has now reported more than 360,000 COVID-19 cases and over 5,000 deaths. U.S. breaks another record with over 75,000 positive cases in one day The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States is continuing to surge with a record number of daily cases reported in just 24 hours. On July 17, there were at least 75,000 positive COVID-19 tests reported in 24 hours according to the New York Times. While deaths related to COVID-19 initially remained flat even as cases climbed, the United States is now seeing a steady rise in deaths. Three states have hit records for deaths in a single day. Florida, South Carolina, and Texas have each announced a record-high number of deaths tied to COVID-19. In total, more than 4,900 people have died in Florida, more than 3,700 people have died in Texas, and more than 1,000 people have died in South Carolina due to COVID-19. Texas hospitals and funeral homes are so overwhelmed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is sending an additional 14 refrigerated trucks after hospital morgues started to fill up, according to CNBC. FEMA had already sent eight trucks to the state. White House tells hospitals to bypass CDC when sending COVID-19 data The White House is telling hospitals to send important data on COVID-19 cases and deaths directly to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), bypassing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The HHS oversees the CDC. The CDC has been collecting data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths since the outbreak began. Infectious disease experts told NPR they\u2019re concerned that the agency is being ignored and politicized during the pandemic. The CDC has long-standing relationships with hospitals nationwide and collects data from hospitals and state governments about a variety of infectious diseases including foodborne outbreaks and seasonal flu. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard not to see this as some kind of interference or snub [to] the CDC,\u201d University of Arizona epidemiologist Saskia Popescu told NPR. \u201cWith so many concerns over the politicization of data right now, this is concerning.\u201d Oklahoma governor tests positive for COVID-19 Governor Kevin Stitt announced yesterday that he has developed COVID-19. Stitt said he had been getting tested periodically and that his symptoms were mild. \u201cI feel fine. I felt a little bit achy yesterday, didn\u2019t have a fever but just a little bit achy,\u201d the governor said, according to NPR. \u201cSo just did my regular testing and it came back positive.\u201d The governor had attended President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa Oklahoma last month, although it\u2019s unlikely he contracted the virus at that event since it occurred nearly a month ago. Stitt is the first U.S. governor to test positive for COVID-19. Other politicians to get the disease include Senator Rand Paul and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms.

Getty Images Remdesivir shortage in COVID-19 hotspots Health officials are reporting a shortage of the medication remdesivir in areas where COVID-19 is surging. The federal government is overseeing the distribution of the medication, originally developed to treat people for Ebola. However, according to CNN, physicians in areas hit the hardest by COVID-19 are reporting they don\u2019t have enough of the drug. In Texas, one hospital reported it had enough remdesivir for just 53 patients despite having admitted over 250 patients since mid-June. Remdesivir, however, isn\u2019t a highly effective drug against COVID-19. In early studies, experts found that it may decrease hospital stays by about 4 days. California starts to shut down again amid rising COVID-19 cases Governor Gavin Newsom is now mandating a statewide shut down of indoor dining, places of worship, bars, and other establishments where COVID-19 could transmit easily. The new shut down comes as the state has seen a surge of COVID-19 cases with over 9,000 cases in a single day (July 7). In a press conference, Newsom said officials are worried that rural counties are running out of hospital beds. \u201cThis virus is not going away any time soon,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon all of us to recognize soberly that COVID-19 is not going away any time soon, until there is a vaccine and/or an effective therapy.\u201d Tweet Share on Pinterest State officials are fighting a surge in COVID-19 cases.

Getty Images Study finds about half of people have signs of heart abnormality after developing COVID-19 A new study found that over half of people who had survived COVID-19 had signs of cardiac abnormalities. Published in the European Heart Journal, researchers looked at data from 1,261 people who had been treated for COVID-19. The research subjects were between ages 52 and 71. About 70 percent of the patients were men. The researchers found that slightly more than half of the total patients \u2014 or 667 people \u2014 had an abnormal echocardiogram. Among people who didn\u2019t previously have heart disease, about 46 percent had an abnormal echocardiogram. The abnormalities seen included issues with the left and right ventricles of the heart and inflammation of the heart muscle. About 15 percent of those studied had severe cardiac disease, including fluid around the heart muscle that can impact its ability to function. Woman who was first in US to get experimental COVID-19 vaccine says she feels fantastic The first person in the United States to get an experimental COVID-19 vaccine says she hasn\u2019t had any side effects. Jennifer Haller, 43, told KOMO News in Seattle that in the months since she was given the experimental vaccine she feels \u201cfantastic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been 16 weeks since I had the first dose,\u201d Haller told KOMO News. \u201cI feel fantastic.\u201d The trial is run by Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, and the experimental vaccine was developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. It uses messenger RNA in the hopes of priming the immune system to develop antibodies. Haller said she\u2019s still taking precautions, since it\u2019s not clear if the experimental vaccine will provide immunity. During initial phase 1 trials, researchers look to make sure that the vaccine is safe. A phase 3 trial is expected later this year that may shed light on how effective the vaccine is. Spring lockdowns saved 370,000 lives, according to new research States that had shelter-in-place orders this spring helped save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The new data was released as the United States is seeing a record number of COVID-19 cases after shelter-in-place orders were lifted in late May and early June. But the report from Health Affairs found that those shelter-in-place orders likely saved many U.S. lives in the early months of the pandemic. According to the report, between 250,000 and 370,000 lives were saved by May 15 as a result of shelter-in-place orders. The report found that effects of physical distancing orders on COVID-19 cases and deaths were less clear.

Federal funding for the sites will end June 30 even as COVID-19 cases continue to surge in the United States. Seven of the testing sites are in Texas which is seeing a spike in cases after reopening at the end of May. On June 23, state officials reported a new daily high of 5,000 cases. Federal officials said they weren\u2019t slowing down on testing and hundreds of sites will remain open. \u201cWe have expanded from the original 41 sites to over 600 in 48 states and the District of Columbia in the federal bundled payment program to pharmacies, and enabled over 1,400 additional pharmacy sites through regulatory flexibility empowering pharmacists and facilitating billing and reimbursement,\u201d Brett Giroir, the administration\u2019s testing czar, told NBC News. The other sites affected by the loss of federal funding are in Illinois, New Jersey, Colorado, and Pennsylvania.

WHO reports highest 1-day increase of COVID-19 cases Six months into the COVID-19 pandemic and the virus is still surging across the globe. On Sunday, June 21, the World Health Organization reported the largest single-day increase in COVID-19 cases with over 183,000 cases reported. The center of the outbreak has shifted from Asia to Europe and now to North and South America. Tweet Brazil reported over 50,000 cases in one day, while the United States reported over 30,000 cases. While COVID-19 cases had been decreasing in the United States since a peak in May, in recent days, cases have started to increase again. As states have reopened, COVID-19 hotspots have appeared in multiple states including Arizona, Texas, and Florida. Plasma from people who survived COVID-19 is safe treatment for the disease A new study out June 18 finds that using plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 is safe for people currently battling the disease. The study published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings involved 20,000 people and found that the treatment, called convalescent plasma, appeared to be safe for people with COVID-19. The first group, about 5,000 people who received the plasma, had a mortality rate of around 12 percent in the subsequent week. In the early stages of the study, plasma was in short supply and people who received the treatment were severely ill. As plasma became more readily available, people were able to get the treatment earlier in their disease when it\u2019s more likely to be effective, and the mortality rate went down. However, it\u2019s unclear if there were other advancements happening simultaneously that could also explain that change. For the larger study, the mortality rate for people who received the plasma was under 9 percent, according to the Washington Post. Because of the way the study was conducted, it wasn\u2019t conclusively clear if the plasma helped lessen COVID-19 symptoms. There wasn\u2019t a control group of people who didn\u2019t receive treatment. \u201cYou\u2019d like to have the gold standard [of evidence] in something this important, and I feel like it always ends up here with this approach,\u201d said Jeffrey P. Henderson, an infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, told the Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s pushed into action quickly, because there\u2019s no other option, and there\u2019s a theoretical reason in the moment that it works.\u201d Researchers say more studies are needed to determine if receiving plasma helped effectively treat people with COVID-19.

Getty Images Florida, Arizona, and Texas see surge in cases amid reopenings The epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak is now shifting in the United States from the east and west coast to southern and western states including Florida, Arizona, and Texas. Texas reported an increase of 11 percent in COVID-19 cases in a single day with over 2,700 new cases reported on Wednesday. Over 93,000 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in the state and over 2,000 people have died from the disease, according to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. In Arizona, over 2,300 cases of COVID-19 were reported on Wednesday. Hospitals in the state are being put under pressure as well, with over 1,500 people hospitalized yesterday and at least 500 people in ICU beds, according to AZ Central. Florida is also seeing a spike in cases with over 2,700 cases reported on Tuesday. In Florida, over 82,000 cases have been reported with more than 3,000 deaths. At least 21 U.S. states are seeing an increase in cases, although former hotspots in New York and New Jersey are seeing their cases decline.

Getty Images FDA revokes emergency approval for a specific antibody test The FDA has revoked approval for a COVID-19 antibody test made by Chembio company. These tests were supposed to detect antibodies that would indicate a past infection of COVID-19. According to the FDA, initial data on the tests was adequate to give approval under emergency authorization. However, subsequent data on the tests found that they were not as accurate as initially thought and that they found high rates of false positives and negatives. Many antibody tests were approved under the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization earlier this year, but experts have said it\u2019s unclear how accurate these tests are. UK will use steroid to treat COVID-19 after reported benefits Health officials in the United Kingdom said they will start using a common steroid to treat people with COVID-19 after a study reportedly found the drug could help improve outcomes for patients. Researchers at Oxford University said that they\u2019ve seen benefits from using a common cheap steroid called dexamethasone to treat people with COVID-19. The team announced the findings in a statement today, but haven\u2019t yet released the findings in a published study. However, the early reports have led health officials in the U.K. to conclude that they will use the steroid to treat people with COVID-19. \u201cThis drug, dexamethasone, can now be made available across the NHS, and we\u2019ve taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak,\u201d UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, according to The Guardian. According to reports from the researchers, the drug helped reduce the mortality rate for the sickest COVID-19 patients \u2014 those on ventilators \u2014 by a third. Other patients who took the drug had their mortality rate reduced by one-fifth. FDA revokes emergency use approval for hydroxychloroquine The FDA is officially revoking emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to be used as a treatment for COVID-19. The drugs, designed originally as antimalarial medication, have been studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19. The drugs were also touted by President Donald Trump, who took hydroxychloroquine for 2 weeks, despite little evidence it could be used to prevent COVID-19. Recent studies of the drugs have found little evidence it helped people with the disease. Additionally, the drugs are known to increase risk of cardiac complications.

Getty Images Rare antibodies may help researchers develop vaccine for COVID-19 California researchers say that a rare type of antibody may help them develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Researchers from the University of California San Francisco and Stanford University are investigating neutralizing antibodies from people who have recovered from COVID-19, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Researchers say that just 5 percent of people with COVID-19 develop these antibodies. Additionally, these antibodies develop in low numbers, so researchers want to see if they can take enough of these antibodies to turn them into a serum that can be given to anyone. More research needs to be done, but researchers hope they can use these antibodies to create a vaccine that can protect against SARS-CoV-2. Protester in Kansas tests positive for COVID-19 As protests against police brutality have taken place across the country, public health experts have been concerned that the virus that causes COVID-19 could spread. This is especially true if people don\u2019t wear masks, are unable to physically distance, or if the police arrest people and put them in jail cells where they\u2019re unable to distance. Now, public health officials in Kansas are reporting that a protester has tested positive for COVID-19 after attending a march without wearing a mask. \u201cSimilar to what we would ask anyone who goes out in public right now, we are asking anyone who attended the recent protest to self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and isolate if they become sick, as well as call their healthcare provider for next steps,\u201d said Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health, Informatics Director, Sonia Jordan. While cases are increasing rapidly in certain states, it\u2019s likely that those increases are due to officials easing lockdowns and physical distancing measures. Due to the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, which can be up to 2 weeks, an outbreak of COVID-19 linked to protests is unlikely to be identified until later this month. CDC gives guidance on how to have a cookout, go to the bank safely The CDC has given new guidance about how to get back to normal activities and stay safe. In a call with reporters, CDC officials gave tips on how to safely go to the bank, have a cookout, and stay in a hotel, according to the Washington Post. The CDC recommended people only use drive up windows or ATMs for banks, for cookouts people should bring their own food and beverages and maintain physical distancing. If you\u2019re going to a hotel or motel this summer, get ready to use the stairs. The CDC is advising people to avoid the elevator unless necessary. Additionally, the CDC has advice for large gatherings. Among the recommendations, they say planners should broadcast tips on staying safe, cut down on the number of attendees to decrease the risk of viral transmission, and limit attendance to people who live in the area so the virus is unlikely to spread far if there is an outbreak.

Getty Images Formerly healthy woman in her 20s has lung transplant after contracting virus A formerly healthy woman in her 20s who developed COVID-19 underwent a successful lung transplant, according to physicians at Northwestern Medical Center. The woman, whose name hasn\u2019t been released, had been hospitalized for weeks after developing COVID-19. Doctors not only put her on a ventilator, they had to put her on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine that oxygenates her blood, essentially doing the work of her lungs. After putting her name on the organ transplant list, they had a match within 48 hours. The patient is now in stable condition and her health is improving, the physicians said. Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and director of the lung transplant program at Northwestern Medical Center, said the patient is awake and talking. \u201cYesterday, the patient smiled and told me \u2018Thank you for not giving up on me,'\u201d Bharat said via the Northwestern Medical Center Twitter. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more gratifying to hear.

Each trial is a phase 3 trial \u2014 traditionally the last phase before a medicine or vaccine can be approved for use \u2014 often involving thousands of volunteers. The three trials are being conducted by three different pharmaceutical companies each looking at a different vaccine candidate. According to CNN, the studies will start with Moderna\u2019s trial in July and then an Oxford/AstraZeneca\u2019s trial in August. Johnson & Johnson announced today that they moved up their trial to start in July. Early successes in phase 1 and phase 2 trials don\u2019t mean any of these vaccine candidates will be successful in their phase 3 trials. However, due to the number of vaccine candidates being tested, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director for the National Institutes for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Healthline this week that he\u2019s cautiously optimistic there may be a viable COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the year. \u201cHopefully by the end of this year we will develop a vaccine we can deploy,\u201d he told Healthline. \u201cWe can never guarantee that.

Published June 8 in Nature , researchers from the University of California, Berkeley looked at how six countries \u2014 China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States \u2014 responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically in the United States, the study found that lockdown measures, which occurred to some degree in nearly all states, helped stop the spread of the disease and that 60 million COVID-19 cases were likely avoided. \u201cWithout these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May,\u201d Solomon Hsiang, director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of the study, told the Washington Post. He said the shutdowns and other mitigation measures were \u201csaving more lives in a shorter period of time than ever before.\u201d Another study also published June 8 found that measures taken by 11 European countries helped curb the transmission of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and likely helped stop 3.1 million deaths.

CDC reports people are misusing cleaning products during COVID-19 outbreak In a survey conducted by the CDC, at least 39 percent of respondents said they had misused cleaning supplies during the pandemic, according to STAT News. The misuse of cleaning supplies is likely among people trying to avoid contracting the virus during the pandemic. Experts say that physical distancing, wearing a mask, and regular handwashing are all key to avoid spreading the virus. In the survey of 502 people, nearly 20 percent said they had put bleach on food, 18 percent said they had used household cleaners on their skin, and 10 percent said they had misted themselves with disinfectant. Additionally, 6 percent said they had inhaled cleaners and 4 percent said they had ingested or gargled cleaners like bleach. This exposure to household cleaners led to a quarter of respondents saying they had negative health effects. Major medical journals retract studies on hydroxychloroquine as treatment for COVID-19 The Lancet medical journal has retracted a study on hydroxychloroquine that made headlines last week. Researchers, who published the study looked at more than 96,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19. The study was retracted due to data used in the study that had not been directly obtained by the researchers themselves. In their retraction letter the researchers from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston said they worked with the company Surgisphere Corporation to obtain data. After other medical experts raised concerns about the company, the researchers conducted a review of the data. However, the Surgisphere Corporation would not give the full dataset to the reviewers meaning they could not do a full independent analysis of the data leading them to retract their study. In the now-retracted study, the drug had been found not to improve people with COVID-19 and more people died after taking the drug. Additionally, the New England Journal of Medicine also reacted a study on COVID-19 and cardiovascular health since it also used data from the company. Hydroxychloroquine fails to prevent COVID-19 in a new study Unlike the studies mentioned above, a new study released today has not been retracted. The large study found that taking hydroxychloroquine wasn\u2019t effective as a prophylactic treatment against COVID-19. Researchers looked at 821 people with no symptoms of COVID-19. Over 87 percent had close contact with someone with the disease. About half of the people \u2014 414 \u2014 were given hydroxychloroquine and the other participants were given a placebo. Researchers found the infection rate among the two groups was statistically similar, meaning hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t show any ability to protect people from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19. They found side effects were more common in people taking hydroxychloroquine but there was no major reactions reported.

The small study published on June 2 in The American Journal of Pathology examined 25 patients with severe or life-threatening symptoms of COVID-19. The patients were given plasma infusions from 9 donors who had already recovered from the illness. The primary goal of the study was to see if plasma transfusions were safe. The researchers found no adverse events from the transfusion in 24 hours after it was administered. Additionally, the researchers reported that 19 of the 25 patients improved after being given the plasma infusions. Three deteriorated and one patient died from causes unrelated to plasma infusion. \u201cWhile physician scientists around the world scrambled to test new drugs and treatments against COVID-19, convalescent serum therapy emerged as potentially one of the most promising strategies,\u201d Dr. James M.

The study published in the medical journal The Lancet found people with advanced cancer were nearly 5 times as likely to die after contracting COVID-19 than people without cancer, according to CNN. Even for people whose cancer was relatively stable had double the risk of death if they contracted the disease. \u201cThe death rate for this group of patients as a whole was 13 [percent] more than twice that reported for all patients with COVID-19\u2026 Certain subgroups, such as patients with active (measurable) cancer and those with an impaired performance status, fared much, much worse,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Warner, MS, associate professor of medicine and biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University, the study\u2019s corresponding author in a statement. However, the team didn\u2019t find that undergoing treatment for cancer, including chemotherapy or having surgery, impacted the risk of dying by COVID-19.

CDC releases guidelines for going back to the office safely The CDC has released new guidelines on how to safely reopen offices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Among their recommendations, the CDC advises companies to assess the building itself to make sure it has enough ventilation to prevent the virus from recirculating. Additionally, they advise separating workspaces and desks so people can maintain 6 feet of separation at all times. They point out that staggered start times, temperature checks, and disinfecting common space areas can also cut down on risk of transmission. Even with all these safeguards, the CDC recommends all workers wear face masks to protect themselves and others from aerosolized viral particles.

Phase 1 testing is designed to look at the safety of the vaccine. The company reported that they\u2019ve seen evidence that people developed antibodies to COVID-19 and that early results show the vaccine is likely safe. However, this is just a phase 1 trial and in order for the vaccine to be approved for use, it will need to be successful in phase 2 trials that look for efficacy and phase 3 trials that look at the appropriate dosage. Additionally, another pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, said they would start to produce vaccines even before they\u2019re proven successful so that there won\u2019t be a shortage of the product if it is approved for use. The company is currently working with Oxford University and investigating an experimental vaccine that\u2019s still being tested for safety and efficacy.

Llamas may help researchers combat COVID-19 Early research finds that certain antibodies in llamas may help combat the virus that causes COVID-19. A study published this week in the journal Cell found that antibodies taken from a llama were engineered to fight the new coronavirus. These special antibodies were effective in a lab setting at neutralizing the virus.

Children just as likely as adults to spread virus New studies find children are just as likely as adults to spread the new coronavirus. These early findings could make potential school openings especially fraught. A German study, which is not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, looked at 60,000 people with COVID-19 in addition to 47 children with the disease. The team found that children had just as much viral load or even higher amounts of viral load than some adults. This early research focusing on how children can spread the virus could be pivotal in helping officials combat a second wave as some states weigh loosening shelter-in-place orders. Another study out of China found that school closures drastically helped lower transmission of the virus and lessen the severity of the outbreak. \u201cWhile proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60 percent and delay the epidemic,\u201d the authors said. Experts point out this is early research and more information is needed. \u201cAre any of these studies definitive?

The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner reported Tuesday, April 21, that two people who died at home in early February had the virus. The cases were identified after the medical examiner tested samples from the patients for COVID-19 due to their flu symptoms. Both of these people likely developed the disease via community spread and not from travel. The first death occurred on Feb. 6 and the second on Feb. 17. Previously, the first known U.S. death from COVID-19 was said to occur in Washington state in late February. \u201cWhat these deaths tell us is that we had community transmission probably to a significant degree far earlier than we had known and that indicates that the virus was introduced and circulating in our community far earlier than we had known,\u201d Santa Clara Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody told reporters.

Getty Images Study finds summer weather won\u2019t help stop COVID-19 A study published April 7 found that the arrival of spring and summer weather likely won\u2019t stop the spread of the virus. The study was published after a panel from the National Academies of Sciences reviewed data from around the world about the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Past pandemics such as the 1918 influenza outbreak have often waned dramatically in the summer with warmer temperatures and higher humidity helping to stop the spread of the virus, at least temporarily. However, officials say in this new report there\u2019s no sign that changes in temperature nor humidity will have a big effect on COVID-19. In part, the panel found that because the virus is new and people don\u2019t have natural immunity, they\u2019ll be more susceptible to contracting the virus throughout the year. The panel did say more research would be needed and there\u2019s a chance the viral spread may slow somewhat during the summer months even if it doesn\u2019t stop. \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity,\u201d the panel wrote, according to the Washington Post. \u201cHowever, given the lack of host immunity globally, this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread.\u201d Share on Pinterest Hospitals in New York report few beds amid growing COVID-19 outbreak.

Virus shedding is high early in illness, study finds A study examined 9 people with SARS-CoV-2. The researchers wanted to understand virus shedding (when the virus leaves its host) during illness to determine how infectious the disease may be. Conducted by German researchers, though not yet peer-reviewed, the findings suggest that viral shedding occurred in high levels from the throat during early phases of illness for the patients studied. However, the rate of shedding dropped after the fifth day in all patients except for two experiencing signs of pneumonia. They continued to shed COVID-19 at high levels until the 10th or 11th day, according to researchers. \u201cThe present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool,\u201d the study authors wrote. Scientists also found that people with COVID-19 may shed over 1,000 times more virus than emitted during peak shedding of the 2003 SARS infection. They say this could explain why COVID-19 has spread so rapidly.

Research finds new ways the virus can spread Researchers are studying how people with the virus shed it and what impact it\u2019s having on affected populations. Testing and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 is currently carried out by oral swabs. But research published Feb. 17 in Emerging Microbes & Infections finds evidence that there\u2019s an oral-fecal transmission route. The scientists reported that viruses\u2019 genetic material can be detected in both anal swabs and blood samples. Crucially, evidence of the new coronavirus was found in anal swabs and blood \u2014 even when it wasn\u2019t detected using oral swabs.

There were lines of hundreds of people outside pot shops in Colorado when just one herbal product was legalized there in 2012. In my years in the natural health industry, there have been swells of public interest over DMSO, coral calcium, Echinacea, resveratrol, even vitamin C with the publication of Linus Pauling\u2019s book VITAMIN C AND THE COMMON COLD (which by the way resulted in a 300% in mortality from coronary heart disease). But there have never been lines of customers waiting to buy any dietary supplement as there has been for a single herb \u2014 recreational marijuana. There are less than 100 health food stores in the State of Colorado There are reportedly over 800 marijuana shops. [ Pot Guide Aug 14, 2015] Just a single herb is going to be a major focus of the economy of some small States as taxes raised from the sale of marijuana will be considerable. Nine States will put legalization of marijuana up for a vote in November 2016. In these States, marijuana would be locally legal but federally illegal. [ Fortune June 29, 2016] About 57% of Americans believe marijuana should be legalized. [ Pew Research Oct 12, 2016] No one can say Americans aren\u2019t entrepreneurial. Over 2000 medical marijuana shops initially opened in Washington State before they were shut down and forced to enter a lottery for new business licenses. Then the State issued 222 new licenses. [ Quartz.com Oct 25, 2016] Passage of Proposition 64 in California to legalize marijuana is expected to generate $1 billion in State revenue. [ San Diego Tribune Oct 27, 2016] In the State of Colorado, marijuana sales in the first year of legal adult-use in 2014 totaled $699.2 million and generated $76.2 million in taxes. In the first 8 months of 2016 sales in Colorado totaled $846.5 million and generated $124.9 million in taxes. [ The Cannabist ] Passage of Prop. 64 in California is projected to grow a $22 billion marijuana business. [ New York Times Oct 24, 2016] Legalization of marijuana is expected to be larger than the wine industry if legalization is nationwide. In fact, marijuana-infused wine is now available. [ AOL.com Oct 14, 2016] There were more arrests for possession of marijuana than for all violent crimes combined last year (2015). [ New York Times Oct 12, 2016] Passage of Proposition 64 in California would reduce the number of arrests for misdemeanor and felony marijuana crimes. About 15,000 to 20,000 people have arrested in California annually for such crimes. Nationwide, FBI numbers indicate arrests for marijuana use in 2015 totaled 643,121, down from 82,720 in 2007.

[ Drug & Alcohol Review May 2016] What kind of country will we have after the complete penetration of pot shops throughout America? Here is how one source explains the marijuana experience: \u201c The \u2018high\u2019 produced by marijuana causes physical changes such as reddening of the eyes, fast heartbeat, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, dizziness, and increased appetite. Despite its high intoxication potential, it has a low dependency (or addictive) potential and low risk of organ damage or death. Cannabis use causes the release of the brain chemical dopamine, which induces a feeling of euphoria on the user. Marijuana users report elevated feelings of happiness, relaxation, relief from pain and anxiety, as well as other potential remedies to physical ailments. However, there are also a number of adverse effects as well. It may disrupt the storage of short-term memories and it may have negative effects on long-term memory for heavy users.\u201d [ Sex Info UC Santa Barbara] Will America be any healthier with the availability of recreational marijuana? Medical marijuana has been prescribed for chronic unremitting migraine headaches, joint pain, glaucoma, nausea during pregnancy, after chemotherapy; for seizure disorders; for nerve pain; for weight loss caused by chronic illness; post-traumatic stress disorder; Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Except for seizure disorders and nausea during pregnancy, it doesn\u2019t get very high grades. [ Prevention ] Marijuana is less addictive than tobacco but more than alcohol. [ Journal Clinical Psychiatry April 2016] Stanton Glantz, a professor at the School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, says legalization of marijuana \u201cis exchanging a criminal justice crisis for a public health crisis.\u201d [ New York Times Oct 24, 2016] I have maintained that marijuana was ushered into use by young adults in America in the 1960s in order to market birth control pills. Marijuana is known to have aphrodisiac properties and increases arousal and sexual activity. It reduces sexual inhibitions. [ Journal Sex Research Aug 1974] Generally, young females are modest and birth control pills were confined to use by women who already had 2 or 3 children and didn\u2019t want more. The proliferation of marijuana ushered in an era of uninhibited sex outside of marriage. The hippy girls of the 1960s were on \u201cthe pill\u201d to prevent pregnancy. The hippy generation was anti-establishment but was lining the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies. The first birth control pill was approved for use in 1960. Despite its claim of preventing unwanted births especially among adolescent females, a decade later the number of abortions skyrocketed. Marijuana + birth control pills led to \u201csafe sex\u201d which actually increased many health risks for females. [ The Pill Kills ] I read recently where the incidence of schizophrenia rises 520% among marijuana users (largely those who over-use). [ Knowridge Science Report Oct 24, 2016] Though it should be added that tobacco use, which often accompanies smoking pot, also increases the risk for schizophrenia and is a co-occurring cause. [ Schizophrenia Research Aug 30, 2016] Some people are more genetically sensitive to develop psychosis from marijuana use. One study shows 44 out of 121 people (36%) with diagnosed schizophrenia developed symptoms of psychosis within 1 month of beginning to smoke marijuana. [ International Journal Neuropsychopharmacology Oct 2010] But that doesn\u2019t mean 36% of marijuana users would become psychotic.

                              "text": "Pot Edibles Are All Grown Up The new generation of pot products is kinder and gentler \u2014 and they taste better, too share Courtesy of Spot Shortly after the state of Washington legalized recreational marijuana, an Eater editor was in Seattle for a wedding and decided to hit up a dispensary. \u201cWe thought it would be a fun, touristy thing to do,\u201d she says. After purchasing a cookie from a reputable edibles company, she and her partner headed back to their Airbnb to partake, following the package\u2019s instructions and each consuming half. \u201cIt tasted fine \u2014 not great, but fine. We were watching Netflix and just enjoying being high, and then it just got really bad. I couldn\u2019t stop twitching \u2014 it was an extremely intense and unpleasant body high . Our perception of time was warped in a way I had not experienced with any previous marijuana use. Eventually we were able to fall asleep, and when we woke up in the morning we felt fine \u2014 but we looked at our phones and saw that independently we both had Googled \u2018how to stop being high.\u2019\u201d \u201cI wanted to make people happy, and make a tasty product from a chef\u2019s perspective.\u201d \u201cIt was a reaction so unlike any I\u2019ve ever had to a marijuana product before,\u201d she says, \u201cthat it made me think maybe I didn\u2019t really understand weed at all, and since then I\u2019ve mostly avoided it.\u201d While unpleasant, this kind of experience is hardly rare. Anyone who\u2019s dabbled in recreational drug use likely has at least one pot brownie anecdote: a high school baking project concocted while your parents were out of town, perhaps, that may have ended in being curled up in the fetal position questioning your own reality \u2014 or, to a different end, a foul-tasting and ineffective end product that was a total waste of a dimebag. But with recreational weed now legal in eight states (California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada approved it last Election Day, though they haven\u2019t yet begun sales to recreational users), not to mention medical marijuana permitted in more than half of U.S. states, a whole new crop of users are experimenting with edibles. And thanks to legal cannabis industry innovators, new categories of products intended to drastically improve the user experience have emerged: Products touting precise \u201cmicro-dosing\u201d and rapid-delivery technology help prevent inexperienced users from eating too much and becoming completely overwhelmed, and carefully concocted recipes from reputable chefs ensure that the products taste just as good as they work. Photo by David McNew/Getty Images The Trouble With Dosing Tourists and inexperienced cannabis users often opt for edibles because they\u2019re more discreet than smoking and require no special equipment or know-how to consume \u2014 but many, whether they\u2019re new to weed or just new to eating it, find themselves overwhelmed by the visceral high that just a few bites of a brownie, cookie, or chocolate bar can induce. In 2013, Colorado became the first state to legalize pot for recreational use. According to a 2014 federal government-commissioned report on the impact of marijuana legalization on the state of Colorado, from 2011 to 2013 the state saw a 57 percent increase in emergency room visits related to marijuana. One doctor quoted in the report stated, \u201c...if they\u2019re coming in related to marijuana, it\u2019s largely related to edibles.\u201d Even for reasonably experienced smokers, edibles can pack an unexpected punch . When cannabis is eaten rather than smoked or vaped, THC (the compound that gets you high) is transformed by the liver into a different, more potent substance . Edibles also take much longer to kick in \u2014 sometimes as long as two hours, which often leads users to think that it\u2019s not working and to eat more \u2014 and the effects are also much longer-lasting, as New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd famously knows all too well . Made by BotanicaSeattle, a Washington-based company that also hawks its products in Oregon, Spot brownie or cookie bites and chocolate squares come packaged in a slickly designed resealable pouch that broadcasts their low dosage: 5mg of THC per serving, which is half the 10mg serving size typically recommended for new edibles users. (Washington law limits recreational marijuana edibles to no more than 10mg per serving, while Colorado requires edibles to be clearly labeled in 10mg increments.) Making edibles in the lab at 1906. 1906 \u201cFive milligrams felt like the right number to me,\u201d says company founder Tim Moxley, a UK-born entrepreneur who\u2019s now one of the top edibles producers in Washington. \u201cI couldn't give my mom 10 milligrams and feel good about it.\u201d The company claims its products are triple-tested to ensure accurate dosing, and Moxley says it\u2019s all about trust: \u201cIf you're going to give a product to [a new edibles user], what you don't want to do is make it too strong and burn them, because you\u2019ll never get them back.\u201d According to research published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2015, only 17 percent of edibles have their THC levels accurately labeled . Many dispensaries say edibles make up anywhere from 25 to 60 percent of their sales, making it a multi-billion dollar industry, and the selection of products is vast \u2014 yes, there are brownies and cookies, but there are also cannabis infused-protein powders, peanut butter, sodas, and, in the case of a new edibles company called 1906, handmade truffles that look like they came from a high-end chocolate boutique. 1906 Boulder, Colorado-based 1906 is the brainchild of former Wall Street banker Peter Barsoom. (Named for the year the Pure Food and Drug Act was passed, requiring cannabis products to be labeled as poison, the company\u2019s tagline is \u201cIt took more than a century for the world to return to its senses.\u201d) The chocolates tout \u201crapid delivery technology\u201d that delivers results in 15 to 20 minutes , rather than an hour or two. Barsoom says his products are aimed at \u201cresponsible, health-conscious adults who want to indulge but can\u2019t afford to lose their mind for six hours.\u201d The company utilizes a pharmaceutical technique called lipid microencapsulation: Basically, a lipid coating allows the THC to bypass the stomach and get into the small intestine faster, where it\u2019s more rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. Barsoom compares the effects of one 1906 chocolate to having one glass of wine: \u201cJust like we can drink alcohol responsibly without getting totally blasted, we can consume cannabis without losing control,\u201d he says. Chefs Get High Though expanding at a breakneck speed, the edibles market is still largely dominated by stuff like Cheeba Chews (a famously strong candy that tastes like a Tootsie Roll, except worse) and generic-tasting cookies or questionably-flavored chocolate bars \u2014 peach? Raspberry habanero? \u2014 that would never see the light of day except for the fact they\u2019re loaded with THC. But as the stigma surrounding pot use begins to fade thanks to legalization and medical breakthroughs, some established names from the culinary world have turned their attention to weed \u2014 and for discerning cannabis users who want their edibles to be worth savoring for the taste as much as for the high, that\u2019s excellent news. Acclaimed Chicago pastry chef, restaurateur, and cookbook author Mindy Segal debuted a namesake brand of edibles last year. Segal, who calls herself \u201cvery pro-marijuana,\u201d says she was approached by one of Chicago\u2019s biggest cannabis cultivators, Cresco Labs, about partnering with them, and for her it was an easy decision. \u201cI knew that I wanted to be a part of this industry,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to make a difference. I wanted to make people happy, and make a tasty product from a chef's perspective.\u201d Products sold at Illinois dispensaries cannot be perishable, meaning the kinds of baked goods you\u2019d find at Segal\u2019s Chicago restaurant and bakery were out of the question. Instead, the Mindy\u2019s Edibles line includes shelf-stable items like caramels in peanut butter and jelly or creamsicle flavors, dark chocolate smoked almond brittle, and vanilla bourbon hard candies (\u201cWe did sucking candy because it\u2019s sublingual and gets into your system faster,\u201d she explains). By using cannabis oils free of terpenes, the compounds that give weed its pungent aroma, the products are largely devoid of any cannabis flavor or smell. @mindysegal/Instagram Segal and Cresco have big plans for the line: Mindy\u2019s Edibles are currently sold in dispensaries across Illinois (where cannabis is currently only legal for medical use), but the company intends to expand its reach into five additional states in the near future, plus they\u2019ve got several new products in the works, including strain-specific and CBD-only items. \u201cA lot of it is just talking to patients and figuring out what they want, and then coming up with a way to elevate it through the eyes of a chef,\u201d Segal says. A chef of Segal\u2019s caliber getting into the edibles industry has the potential to lure in a new demographic: A weed world icon like Snoop Dogg having a line of cannabis chocolates is one thing, but a James Beard Award-winning chef hawking weed products is bound to pique the interest of a few marijuana skeptics. Segal\u2019s not the first pastry chef to dip her toe into the legal cannabis industry, either: One of Washington State\u2019s most popular edibles brands, Goodship Company, is the brainchild of Jody Hall, who\u2019s better known as the founder of a Seattle bakery called Cupcake Royale that now has six locations. Goodship\u2019s line includes items such as fair-trade dark chocolate bars infused with third wave coffee beans. As Goodship writes on its website, \u201cThe best marijuana edibles are more than just delivery mechanisms.\u201d The Future of Edibles Legal marijuana sales in North America totaled $6.7 billion last year and are expected to surge to $20 billion by 2021, according to a report by Arcview Market Research. (To put that in perspective, Arcview says the only consumer industries to match that kind of insane compounding annual growth have been the cable TV industry in the \u201890s and broadband internet in the 2000s.) More than half of Americans say they support legalizing pot, but with Republicans in control of all three branches of government (and a newly appointed attorney general who\u2019s staunchly anti-pot), many worry that federal legalization is a long ways off. Still, \u201cIt\u2019s financially a really great opportunity for states, and we\u2019re controlling a substance that really should not be on Schedule 1,\u201d says Segal, pointing out that the DEA puts weed in the same category as dangerous drugs like heroin. Snacking on THC-laced chocolates may still be far from mainstream, but along with modern, minimal packaging that\u2019s devoid of pot leaves and bloodshot-eyed cartoon characters and high-end dispensaries that feel more like luxury boutiques than head shops, better-tasting edibles offering a kinder, gentler experience are helping to further de-stigmatize a substance that\u2019s shown to be exponentially less harmful than alcohol or tobacco. \u201cOne of the tougher things for me to do is to come out and say, \u2018I use marijuana,\u201d Botanica Seattle founder Tim Moxley admits. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to say that when you\u2019ve been conditioned not to, and to wonder what people will think about you. But if I can\u2019t say I enjoy marijuana when I run a marijuana company, then we\u2019re all a bit screwed, aren\u2019t we?\u201d ",

                              "text": "The Hard Working American vs. The Government Parasite By Michael Snyder, on April 10th, 2012 \nWhich lifestyle choice produces better results \u2013 being a hard working American or being a government parasite? Actually, when you look at the cold, hard numbers they may just surprise you. In America today, we deeply penalize hard work and we greatly reward government dependence. If you live in a very liberal area of the country and you know how to game the system, it is entirely possible to live a comfortable existence without ever working too much at all. In fact, there are some Americans that have been living off of \u201cgovernment benefits\u201d for decades. Many of these people actually plan their lives around doing exactly what they need to do to qualify for as many benefits as possible. America is rapidly turning into a European-style socialist welfare state and it is destroying our nation socially and financially. Ever since the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d began our debt has absolutely exploded and yet now there are more poor people in this country than ever before. Obviously something is not working. \nNow don\u2019t get me wrong. I deeply believe in having compassion for those that are going through tough times and having a safety net for those that cannot take care of themselves. We should not have a single person in this nation going without food or sleeping in the streets. \nBut in America today it is absolutely ridiculous how many people are climbing aboard the \u201csafety net\u201d. At this point, an astounding 49 percent of all Americans live in a home that receives some form of government benefits. \nSo who pays for all of this? \nThe people that drag themselves out of bed and go to work each day pay for it all. \nFor a few moments, let\u2019s examine how the lifestyle of a typical hard working American compares to the lifestyle of a government parasite. \nIn America today, the median yearly household income is somewhere around $50,000. About half of all American households make more than that and about half of all American households make less than that. When you break it down, it comes to about $4000 a month. \nSo how far does $4000 go in America today? \nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t go very far at all. \nFirst of all, a hard working American family will need some place to live. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the decent jobs are near the big cities, and it is more expensive to live near the big cities. Let\u2019s assume that an average family of four will spend about $1000 a month on rent or on a mortgage payment. \nThe government parasite, on the other hand, has a whole host of federal, state and local housing programs to take advantage of. During the recent economic downturn, more Americans than ever have been turning to the government for help with housing costs. For example, federal housing assistance outlays increased by a whopping 42 percent between 2006 and 2010. \nOnce you have a place to live, you have to provide power and heat for it. For the average hard working American, this is going to probably average about $300 a month, although this can vary greatly depending on where you live. \nFor the government parasite, there are once again a whole host of government programs to help with this. For example, LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program) assists low income households in paying their home heating bills. \nMost average hard working Americans are also going to need phone and Internet service. Let\u2019s assume that the hard working family of four in our example is extremely thrifty and only spends $100 a month for these services. \nFor the government parasite, cell phone service is not a problem. As I have written about previously , those that \u201cqualify\u201d can receive a free cell phone and free cell phone minutes every single month from the federal government. In addition, in some areas of the nation low income families can qualify for deeply subsidized home Internet service . \nIn order to earn money, our hard working family is going to need to get to work. In most households, both parents have decided to work these days so both of them will need cars. Let\u2019s assume that the family is very thrifty and that both cars were purchased used and that the car payments only total about $400 a month. \nThe hard working family will also need auto insurance for the two vehicles. Let\u2019s assume that both parents have a great driving record and that they only pay a total of about $100 a month for car insurance. \nThe cars will also need to be filled up with gasoline. The average U. S. household spent $4155 on gasoline during 2011, but let\u2019s assume that our family is very, very careful and that they only spend about $300 on gas each month. \nSo what about the government parasite? Well, the government parasite does not need to go to work, so this expense can potentially be eliminated entirely. But since most other things are paid for by the government or are deeply subsidized, in many instances government parasites are actually able to afford very nice vehicles. \nIn addition, a new bill (The Low-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act) has been introduced in Congress that would give \u201cqualifying\u201d households money to help pay for gasoline\u2026. \nLow-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act \u2013 Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to states to establish emergency assistance programs to pay eligible households for the purchase of gasoline. \nA hard working American family is also going to need health insurance. Well, we all know how expensive health insurance has become. In fact, health insurance costs have risen by 23 percent since Barack Obama became president. But let\u2019s assume that our hard working family has somehow been able to find an amazing deal where they only pay $500 a month for health insurance for a family of four. \nFor the government parasite, health insurance is not needed. If there is an emergency, the government parasite can just go get free medical care at any emergency room. \nAnd of course there is always Medicaid. Back in 1965, only one out of every 50 Americans was on Medicaid. Today, one out of every 6 Americans is on Medicaid, and things are about to get a whole lot worse. It is being projected that Obamacare will add 16 million more Americans to the Medicaid rolls. \nSo what about food? \nEveryone has to eat, right? \nWell, the hard working family in our example is faced with an environment where food prices are constantly rising but paychecks are not keeping up. Let\u2019s assume that the hard working family in our example clips coupons and cuts corners any way that it can and only spends about $50 for each member of the family on food and supplies each week. That comes to a total of $800 a month for the entire family. \nSo what about the government parasite? \nGovernment parasites need to eat too. \nWell, that is where food stamps come in. Right now, there are more than 46 million Americans on food stamps. Since Barack Obama became president, the number of Americans on food stamps has increased by 14 million. Food stamps have become so popular that rappers are even making rap videos about using food stamp cards. \nOkay, so after all of this where do we stand? \nWell, the average hard working family so far has spent $3500 out of the $4000 that they have to spend for the month. \nWe still need to find money for clothing, for paying off credit card debt, for paying off student loan debt, for dining out, for entertainment, for medications, for pets, for hobbies, for life insurance, for vacations, for car repairs and maintenance, for child care, for gifts and for retirement savings. \nBut wait. \nThere is actually no money left at all because we have forgotten one of the biggest expenses of all. \nTaxes. \nWhen you total up all federal, state and property taxes, our average hard working family is going to pay at least $1000 a month in taxes. \nSo that puts our average hard working family in the hole every single month. \nMeanwhile, the government parasite does not pay any taxes because he or she does not earn enough money to be taxed. \nAre you starting to get the picture? \nIn many ways, life can be so much easier when you are constantly taking from the government instead of constantly giving to the government. \nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie recently put it this way \u2026. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a bunch of people sitting on a couch waiting for their next government check\u201d \nOnce again, I am not dumping on those that have been through all kinds of nightmares because of this economy. As I have written about so frequently, the U.S. economy is simply not producing enough jobs for everyone anymore, and this is creating major problems. \nJust about everyone needs a helping hand at some point, and we should always be compassionate to those that are in need. \nHowever, there is also a growing number of Americans that are content to simply give up and live off of the government, and that is fundamentally wrong. \nIt is not the job of the U.S. government to take care of you from the cradle to the grave. What the U.S. government is supposed to do is to make sure that we have a well functioning economy that operates in an environment where hard working individuals and small businesses can thrive, and sadly the U.S. government has failed miserably in that regard. \nWe desperately need the U.S. economy to be fixed, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath waiting for that to happen. \nAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance and at some point the safety net is going to break. \nWhat is our country going to look like when that happens? The Shocking Truth About Unemployment In America In One Chart \u00bb David H \nPreach it Michael! I work in the finance industry and can\u2019t tell you how many applications I see where the single mother of 1-4 kids, in some cases, from different fathers is getting child support, afdc, wic, housing assistance and has a boyfriend or ex- husband living with them and making 2-5k a month. These people live better than most others because they are working the system with no one to tell them anything different! In addition to this issue we have another large issue of people bartering or being paid in cash avoiding taxation completely. We are all going to pay dearly for our arrogance, indifference, and ignorance! Rancher \nYou know what\u2026 there are and more often times I would rather burn my cash than send it into the govt to pay these bums sitting at home. We do every darn thing we can to keep it out of those leaches grasp\u2026. Prepared Pastor \nI briefly dated a woman with three children who I saw really gaming the system. Her subsidized townhouse apartment was nicer than my own home. Her utilities were based on her income and she made great dinners using food stamps. \nShe was in her last semester of college to earn a bachelor degree when I asked her what her plans were for after college. When she told me she was going for another degree so she could stay on the dole I broke up with her. \nI imagine she has a free cell phone now. Michael \nI would say that you sure dodged a bullet there Pastor. \nMichael Joel \nIf you want to have an idea of the sress it can create for workers just look toward Belgium (Europe). It\u2019s the country with the \u201cbest\u201d welfare system. From your birth to your death you are under government umbrella. Of course this come at a price : the active workforce pay for it. \nFor instance, did you know, an immigrant can receive money from the government (as a right to live decently) even without working. Then he can bring in his family if he was alone when he arrived (under the family reunion excuses), which in turn have some right also\u2026 The amount of money they can receive is between 900 \u2013 1200euros per month\u2026 all of that at the expense of the workforce. \nBy the way, the demographic pyramid his completely reversed. At first the Belgian welfare system was build around an era of full employment (50\u2019s and 60\u2019s), when the workforce was made up of young generations (babyboomers) and when everything has to be rebuild after the war. \nNow, the babyboomers at become the papyboomers and have a right for their retirment, etc, etc. Yet this system being based on the active workforce (made up of less young people and underqualified), it is meant to crash one day or another. \nTo see the USA going toward a European version of welfare system is a huge mistake destroying the foundation of your country. \nJo\u00ebl MisterD \nUnfortunately, I believe this has passed the point beyond return. The best anyone can hope for now is a miracle or get ready for the inevitable crash. I pray that nobody nor I will be forced in the middle of the mess such as having to literally protect oneself from crazy people, etc. Ashley B. \nFinally someone that is not afraid to say something about this! It sickens me to see people leeching off the system because it\u2019s easy money and food and of course free. \nI know of LOTS of people where I live that get food stamps, SSI, welfare etc. because it\u2019s free and they don\u2019t want to work (many of them are too lazy to take the trash out, seriously) \nYet me and the rest of my family earn a living, work hard and have to look at these bums drive nice cars, sit home all day and pump out paychecks, I mean kids. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, some people honestly need help and I often donate to the needy, but these are different from the pure lazy bums that just TAKE benefits because they\u2019re too lazy to work. Jodi \nI have to say I love the \u201cpump out paychecks, I mean kids\u201d. So true! I have a friend who is a retired nurse and she has seen a lot of young people in the hospital with child who had good intensions on going to college and getting a degree. Most of them go to school, get married and get pregnant before they even graduate. Without even thinking about starting a good life and financially being prepared, they get on medicaid & welfare because they don\u2019t have the money or a job to take care of their child. Sheepdog 1 \nI guarantee that the \u201cGovernment Parasites\u201d will pay\u2026 \n\u2026come Judgement Day. \nMeaning of course, they will never pay. Recoveryless Recovery \nGreat article, as usual! \nOne of the MAIN reasons why the American sheeple haven\u2019t REVOLTED yet is precisely thanks to all the government hand-out programs that currently exist. Indeed as you well said; many, many Americans actually plan their entire lifestyles around doing whatever it takes to continuously qualify for them. Unfortunately for the rest of us, as long as there\u2019s a dumpster behind a McDonald\u2019s that these SLOBS can dive into for free food, they will NEVER go hungry. And revolutions rewquire HUNGRY people. \nCheckmate. \nToday\u2019s America offers only TWO viable expectations for achieving actual \u201chope & change you can believe in\u00ae\u201d: one requires you to wield a passport & one-way ticket overseas, the other requires wielding an AK-47. \nI myself will go with Option A. Paul \nThe fostering of dependency on illegitimate governments installed through media fraud or outright election fraud (like you have in the US) is what it is really about. DAS \nI will give you an example of the the system is flawed. My father worked full time all his life. Paid all his taxes, S.S. and so forth. When the doctors found his canser, it was to late, he had only a short time to live. He worked intill the day he fell and could not walk. We (his family) supported him with his finaces as best we could. Going to the goverment only for help with food stamps. They gave him 14 dollars a month! W.T.F. can you buy with that. We shopped at discount stores, were many people used food stamps. I watched as these people got in to nice cars, with nice clothes with BAGS full of food. Mean while I hurried back to my 12 year old truck (so i wouldent be late for work) with a small bag a crap food. I guess I need to lean how to milk the system too. R.I.P. dad mondobeyondo \n$14.00 a month? GASP! The explanation that comes to mind is, the government must have been using employment and income data from 1912, not 2012. \nThe reality is, Uncle Sam is flat broke. He has too much pride to tell you he\u2019s broke. Bernadette \nThat is just sick, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. That is so ridiculous I don\u2019t even know what to say. GOD bless your poor dad, and you for having to go through that. I\u2019m so sorry:( Jodi \nIt\u2019s true, I\u2019ve known some people in my life that do as little at possible to get government assistance. Most of them seem very proud of it and believe they deserve it. My question is, what happens when government runs out of money and can\u2019t pay all these people who have been dependent for so long? That doesn\u2019t sound good! Nothing to see here, go back to sleep. Ron \nThink Greece WM \nJodi, Don\u2019t go back to sleep when the money runs out. It is inevitable that the borrowed money will stop coming and all therse free loaders who have no clue of what it\u2019s like to actually do something, will riot, protest, and burn the cities of America down. Consider this future event as a time of national cleansing, because the millions and millions of law abiding citizens who enjoy the 2nd Ammendment,and have worked for what they have, will surely bear arms to protect themselves from the entitlement zombies coming to take what they have\u2026 \nThere will be a population decrease and a cleansing of the entitlement crowd. \nBut, please do not sleep. This is a time to prepare and keep watch, things are going to get very interesting in this nation in the very near future. Jodi \nI will never go to sleep. It seems like the media ignores this stuff and treats people like it\u2019s time to go back to sleep. That is what I meant! 007 \nHave you ever watched a zombie movie. It will be a lot like that when the government checks stop. James \nThe poor and unemployed in the U.S. will never be able to get off of the government roles. We are experiencing what I like to call, \u201cReverse Industrial Revolution\u201d. The Industrial Revolution was a time when farmers were attracted to the big cities for jobs that paid high wages, when compared to their farm incomes. Now, we are experiencing high unemployment from jobs that will never come back unless the energy situation is somehow reversed. These unemployed people will soon realize that they have to have someway to get food to feed themselves. Especially if food stamps and government assistance starts to disappear, and it will. These unemployed people should begin to relocate out into rural areas to find homes where they can grow and produce their food, and sell the rest for income. There is a situation starting to appear in this country where going to college is not a good investment anymore. The only real need for college nowadays is for medicine, engineering, and law. You would be better off taking out a loan for a farm. or opening a small business rather than going to college. Farm and agrarian related jobs can make good money, especially if you own your business. If this reversal comes to fruition, the small rural towns will come back to life and support families and provide a reasonably good life. Tom \nThe only real need for college nowadays is for medicine, engineering, and law. \nMedicine and engineering- yes, but law? The LAST thing this country needs is another lawyer (sorry Michael)! MANY of the problems facing this country were caused but lawyers and the fear of law suits! Tom \nsorry again- by lawyers nowwthen \nGood points. If you can\u2019t find work with a useless bachelor\u2019s degree you will still be accountable for paying back your student loans even after going through bankruptcy. If, like you advise, you instead borrow money to buy a farm or start a business your hard work would benefit you and your family and not a corporation that views you as an expendable business expense. And if your business failed those loans could be reduced or eliminated through bankruptcy. Too many kids are brought up being told to study hard so they can grow up and find a good job. Parents should be telling them to study hard and learn how to run a business that involves doing what you\u2019re good at. S. Wiseman \n\u201cYou would be better off taking out a loan for a farm. or opening a small business rather than going to college. Farm and agrarian related jobs can make good money\u201d James, you are right on the money. I know many people who are doing just that \u2013 buying or leasing small acreage to grow crops (1 to 5 acres) and build cottage industries. They are sick and tired of being milk cows for the government leeches and are doing the right thing by starving the beast of what it needs. The major news networks will never report this trend but it is happening. The peaceful revolution has begun. Of course, the government may react with forced labor. Bernadette \nWow, those are really good ideas, and I agree with you on so many levels:) Why are you not running for President? We need someone at the Helm with a sharp mind, with creative ideas. Not the ideas of destruction coming from Washington. Everything you said made so much sence. Now I know what to pray about:) Cinderella Man \nAgreed going back to the basics of rural living will become a means to an end in the future. There is no hope in living in the superslum cities of tommorrow! ky survivor \nOne step closer to total control. That is what a welfare state is about. God help us. Josh \nI highly doubt that Jesus would use the term parasite to describe a fellow human being. DAS \nYour right. He would call them leaches Another Richard \nHow about \u201cvipers\u201d in Mathew 3:7? Jesus was not at all \u201cpolitically correct\u201d as we sweet Christians are Laodocian America are. Colin \n\u2026you have a better term? David H \nTrue\u2026.but he would say get off your rear end and work for your living if you are able. At least volunteer your time to some worthy cause to help justify the free lunch your on. I have a relative that draws SSDI (Social Security Disability) and volunteers he says he does it to help justify his disability payments he recieves. We need more people in the world like that. 007 \nHow about sluggardly leaches. If a man will not work let him not eat. Proverbs. Steve \nYour blog refers to those who feeding off of the nanny state. What about the millions of government(valueless)workers making 75 \u2013 150 K/year with all the perks and a rosy pension they can start to draw before they turn 60 (unless they double or triple dip). They\u2019re just as parasitic as the the free loader on the dole. Altogether, these parasites make up more than half of America\u2019s population. At this stage of the empires existence, I\u2019m saying to myself, let it all collapse. It\u2019s going to be hellish but the longer the government props up the dog poop with fiat money, the more chaotic it will be. Michael \nSteve: \nYes, you are right. I have written about the inflated compensation that government workers get in the past. \nMichael Klean \nAll systems are broken. There is no right anymore. Stop thinking there is a right way to do something. Going back to sleep is more interesting than earning a living. SpunkyBunks \nMy lazy obese sister is one of these parasites. We are all ashamed of her and she knows it. Her worthless husband doesn\u2019t even bother showing up around us anymore because he knows we think less of him as well. And they have five children, 3 of them are high school dropouts so far. Great welfare system we have in Amrica. It rewards these losers to sit around and breed more idiots too! Paul \nNice family. \nWhere have family values gone these days? \nWhy should the tax payer pay for YOUR family, if you do nothing but complain about them? \nWhat have YOU done to prevent your nieces and nephews dropping out of high school? Bernadette \nYour sister is so lucky to have such a supportive family to help her through her hard times. I\u2019ll just bet you all were that supportive of her during her whole life that\u2019s why she\u2019s been such a success. \nGood job mom and dad:D Mattyboy \nStart to hide your income. Make extra cash doing things (legal) that can be hidden. This has gone on for a long time in the EU. Taxes are close to 90% over there. I do not want to pay the Fed for a number of reasons. I wish we had a revolt of about 200 million that decided to not pay taxes. I guess we would only need 58 million. I like making cash that I do not have to claim. I would also support a flat tax and the abolition of the IRS. But, you can\u2019t trust the Gov. they always \u201cneed\u201d more money. Kathy Smith \nI totally agree MATTY I wish there was a way to get everyone to not pay taxes for 1 pay check & not buy gasoline for 1 day.That would get some attention.

I no longer manage the apartment complexes, but I have seen all that Michael writes about in the past. It make me sad to see where this country has gone. We used to be a proud nation that could do anything, but no longer is our population strong in heart. We have become a weak useless country of people that think everyone else owes them a living. tappedops \nFor the umpteenth time\u2026 dont get mad\u2013get even,\u2026 and if you cant get mad, its because youve been labotomized by the air food and the water\u2026 your programmed\u2026your under mind control\u2014 yea- laugh while you can.

I am a tax payer. I also an unemployed, but if I need some assistance you betcha I will apply. My dad, who is a Vietnam Vet, can qualify for food stamps but he say \u201cWe aren\u2019t that po\u2019!\u201d My mom wants him to get the aid. Anyway to help make ends meet should be explored.

Cinderella Man \nDude they take taxes out of unemployment checks\u2026 McKinley Morganfield \nYes, they take FICA out. But in the end isn\u2019t it really government playing a charade by simply giving them less? BTW, SS & medicare, which are supposed to be funded by FICA receipts, are both in the red. For every $1.00 DC spends, $0.40+ is borrowed money. Annual interest payments on the federal debt will soon be $500,000,000,000. Do you think this can continue another 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? Rancher \nExcuse while I barf\u2026. Rodster \nThere\u2019s a big difference.

At This Time the Democrat party is pounding the welfare drum again, they want to add more people to the welfare rolls in this state, who in the hell is going to pay for this? This state is already having money problems we do not need anymore.Since i have been told that i am confused let me relate a fact to you sharonj one reason george bush would not sign the kyoto treaty back when he was president was because of the irreversable damage it would do to the u.s economy now obama has done this in his own way and look at what has happened and mix that together with the ptb\u2019s desire to create a global economy somebody has to pay the price and it is obvious who it is. I Am Neither Democrat nor Republican as i do not care for either, old phart why don\u2019t you tell them to point the gun the other way? Some people in this country are stupid and lazy and need to get off there fat asses and quit stuffing there faces full of potato chips and get a education and a job, the truth hurts doesn\u2019t it. I Am tired of seeing more and more of my hard earned money going to deadbeats so they can live a nice easy life and not have one ounce of respect for the people that are making it happen for them. Gay Veteran \n\u201c\u2026the problem with companies leaving this country started when obama took office\u2026.\u201d \nThat is pure BS and you know it. I\u2019m no Obama fan but outsourcing did not start with him. McKinley Morganfield \nTo protect fools for the folly of their actions fills the world with fools. If you want more of something subsidize it. If you want less of something punish it. We, in the name of compassion, reward fools who have made bad choices. We subsidize those bad choices generation after generation. We punish frugality and hard work via regulations, taxes, and low interest rates. \nDemocracy is dangerous when it creates a class of citizens who benefit from the frugality and hard work of others. Robbing Peter to pay Paul only works until you run out of Peters to rob. I have compassion for those who are truly needy through no fault of their own, but leeches must be starved. Blood sucking ain\u2019t the way. mondobeyondo \nThe system seems to be geared toward rewarding the parasites. There are those out there who truly, honestly are in a hard-luck situation, and need a helping hand, so to speak. \nAnd then you have the parasites and leeches. Those who decide to make government dependence their career choice. The ladies (ahem \u2013 I use that term loosely) who are accustomed to pumping out a baby every couple of years so they can get better benefits. Food stamps, Aid to Dependent Children, WIC, child support (hope you had a \u201csugar daddy\u201d knock you up!) All coming their way in 9 months! And they didn\u2019t even have to move their bloated gluteus maximus (okay, obese donkey) off of the couch. Life is grand! \nGovernment assistance programs were not created so that these leeches can suck the lifeblood out of the hard working people. Another Richard \nGovernment assistance programs were created to make the Masses dependent upon the Gubmit. Roosevelt once said that \u201cnothing happens in Gubmit by accident\u201d. Gubmit undrestands human nature very well and how dependent humanity becomes on freebies and will cooperate with the gubmit to attack the honest hard working people who produce things and are the Real tax payers. When the producers of goods and services want the Freebies stopped by the gubmit, the leaches and parasite Masses will defend the Gubmit giveaways to the Death. Gubmit knows that. whens dinner? \nIt\u2019s a simple as this: \u201ceverybody wants to eat the corn, but nobody wants to plow the fields\u201d. Tom Lowe \nA lot of us don\u2019t mind plowing the fields! In fact we actually enjoy doing so. mondobeyondo \nI hope my federal income tax money (yes, I have to pay this year) doesn\u2019t go to helping those lazy pathetic sloths. But you know and I know that\u2019s exactly where it\u2019s going. \nNow I\u2019m starting to get angry. You won\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry. (Thanks, Incredible Hulk!) \nTo those intentionally taking advantage of the system: Someone is going to play Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire\u201d at your funeral. Just sayin\u2019\u2026. 007 \nThe most infuriating aspect of this welfare system is that it is unrealistic and unsustainable. The welfare state slowly but surely strangles the economy. The higher taxes and regulations and overbearing laws destroy the ability of businesses to survive. Inevitably, the unsustainable benefits will end just like they are ending in Greece. What will the parasites do when the freebies stop. They will starve like domesticated pets do or they will turn violent. Either way it will be a night mare similar to post apocalyptic zombie movie. It will be a pitiful life trying to avoid being eaten alive by these same parasites that are currently living off of the government tit. Tom Lowe \nI believe that is one reason why they have built \u2018Camp FEMA\u2019. 007 \nGreat article Michael. You certainly articulated the crisis which is slowly strangling the life out of the country. I read your article and feel I am able to look into the future and see how this nightmare ends.

Pat \nLet me also add that: \n1. in Europe a garbage man makes as much income as a physician. Neither can be fired for incompetence. \n2.Income taxes in some places can be as high as 70%. And they have no deductions. \n3. The government is in direct competition with business. \n4. There is very little fishing or hunting. Pollution is rife. \n5. Few if any go to university. \n6. You must register where you live. \n7. Even your name change has to be approved by the courts if you want to use a name that is not on an approved list. \n8. And most of the people live in small flats often without bath tubs. \n9. In Spain we have no kitchen. In Denmark we had no shower or tub. \n10. All protests must be approved by the government. \nWelcome to your future. \n\u2026as it is so in many sectors of the U.S. education system. \nHow many schoolteachers are fired for incompetence? Not many, I suspect. \nTeachers teach the leaders of tomorrow. Our future teachers, teach future biologists, musicians, artists, plumbers, scientists, Web page designers, doctors, veterinarians, you name it. \nFor the job they do, most teachers are highly underpaid. The athletic coaches and deans are well compensated, of course. \nMaybe it is not so important to most of you. But try having garbage workers go on strike for a month. You will soon realize how essential they are. View from Abroad \n@1) How did you like your stay in Albania? \n@2) You seem to speak of some of the Scandinavian Countries (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway)\u2026but there the vast majority, even of those who are in the top-income-tax bracket, approve of it, because they see that they have a superior education system and an overall very efficient government and even welfare system. \n@3) Yes, right \u2013 government chooses to do e.g. waste management themselves, ecologically and recyclable to the max\u2026instead leaving it to the likes of \u201cBarone Sanitation\u201d (remember your \u201cSopranos\u201d, do you?). And you really think, YOU are better off in this matter???? \n@4) In most of rural Europe there is as much fishing and hunting as in rural US. Of course maybe not so much fishing e.g. in the Thames or the Rhine \u2013 so what? Go fishing in downstream Hudson River, and see what you catch. \n@5) Surprise: quite a LOT go to university \u2013 and WITHOUT burdening themselves with student loans for the rest of their lives, because it\u2019s mostly FREE (except for some \u201cElite\u201d institutions, where the only meaning of \u201cElite\u201d is \u201cRich\u201d). \n@6) Yes. So what??? \n@7) Yes\u2026there was a couple of immigrants in Cologne (Germany) a few years ago, who wanted to name their newborn son \u201cOsama bin Laden\u201d ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,212569,00.html ) \u2013 sorry, you are right, they were wrongfully turned down by our brutal, fascist, jackbooted Civil Servants. Horrible. \n@8+9) Well, YOU get what YOU can afford, even in Europe. But I have heard rumors that somewhere in Germany and even in France there are flats with a water closet(!!!)\u2026never seen one myself, poor me old European\u2026 \n@10) Oh, yes\u2026horrible. Luckily in the US you can rally any amount of people at any time you like \u2013 to let them get tasered down by the thugs you call \u201cPolice\u201d Gary2 \nStop speaking the truth you are ruining a lot of low information foolish republican conservatives world view. \nYou are 100% correct. \nLike I said before reality has a well known liberal bias. Marcus \nThat was eastern Europe 30 years ago\u2026 In Scandinavia we\u2019re doing quite well atm. I would say there\u2019s less welfare here than in the USA by now. And I pay 30% tax. For these 30% I get healthcare as well. I live in a nice house, I have a new car, I eat good and healthy food. Almost all services are private, even the ones financed by taxes. And I\u2019n not considered rich here. I\u2019m middle class. \nIn my opinion the middle class is actually growing here. And, by the way, my country does not have any oil. \nHave you ever been to Europe? Maybe Romania then\u2026 Idiot\u2026 Gwyn \nI am so sick of hearing how wonderful is to be living on Government hand-out. One I start working at 16. At the age of 50 my health and back went. I have done manual work all my life and now I can not stand for 5 min. before I need to sit. And for all that I live on $718. a month and get $50. on food stamps. And in the winter I may get 500. for winter heat. My house is $300 a month in cold of winter. They used to give $150. for cooling in summer but that end so they could help more people with winter needs. I do not own a car, could not afford repair it if broke down. So that mean friend who I pay gas money to or a cab if shopping or bus to go doctors. Also medicaid is no wonderfulness either I am grateful for it, but I have go to a clinic and wait for a month or six weeks for appointment or go emergency ward. Also my pills can be change any time state decide that they get better deal from another company. Not if it good for me or not. I am not living in one of those towers and paying 1/3 of income. I am lucky my family left part ownership of house to me. But I have property Tax to pay and house insurence and repairs and I do not get free phone or internet,I pay for it and the taxes that go with it. I do have to pay some money to doctor and pills but not lot I agree. But living like this means you are my entertainment. I bake my own bread and clean my house from chair. Also my clothes are second hand. Goodwill have lots of visit from people now days. I get sick of this idea that poor pay no taxes. What bill do get that does not some kind of tax on it. Anyone useing those same service have to pay them as well. Are they has much as yours? no. but they all so have less. Less to have fun on less to go out on and less to buy lots food with. Live on $50 see how far that take you. The rest comes for that monthly check I so lovely dream about every month sitting on my sofa. Till you be there you have no idea what like to live it. Not the pain I live with or problem that come with living. I look forward with fear as I watch the state and Federal government talks about things they need to cut so they can give people who live fancy house more money and want to vote for man for President who has bank account in places,like that Island and country with special banking laws. Make no mistake I know that cuts are coming but I am not going easy into that goodnight, so our million dollar congress men and women can keep there golden rewards. I know neither of the parties are our friends but I also know games have been play and working people money got rip off instead of yell for their heads so offend you worry about those who have less then you do. denny \nThe article itself betrays its own horse . If families had that many liabilities every month, they wouldn\u2019t be paying very much in taxes. The 1% have that part down though as most of them don\u2019t pay near as much relative to what a $50,000 wage earner pays. It\u2019s also suspicious that this article doesn\u2019t mention corporate welfare which usually receives twice as much as the social welfare recipients do and let\u2019s not forget what all those lobbyists are for. What\u2019s a Lockeed/Martin contract except glorified corporate welfare or the blackmailing which corporations pull on municipalities when they promise to build a factory in the environs ONLY if they are exempted from paying local taxes. Nah, this article is just more of the Republican AND Democrat crap of blaming those of us who have been hit the hardest for the consequences of the war which the wealthy have laid our lives, infrastructure and jobs to waste. Surprised to find it on this site. Tom Lowe \nThe article is quite clearly directed at professional freeloaders, and not at unemployed people. Jeremy \nWhile I disagree with much of Michael\u2019s predictions and assertions in his articles (because our nation has come from the brink many times before), he writes on elite welfare and wealth hoarding all the time. \nHe is fair. Leonard \nDear Michael \nIf you take away every single benefit of all these people, you will end up creating plenty of criminals on the streets who will end up in jail getting free food, free air conditioning, libraries, internet, and free health care for many many years to come. You mentioned an article some time ago how somebody checked himself into jail with some kind of a fake holdup in order to get health care in prison. Who do you think will end up paying for this? The banksters? The fat cats? The corporations? Good luck. Remember this: EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE! \nA job is a social program! Somebody has to give it to you when they hire you. When jobs are shipped overseas, then millions are out of work. If people are so happy with lay-offs, they end up paying for it one way or another! How many people are going to become successful like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs? Almost everybody? Good luck. Remember to play the lottery next time, anybody can win $200,000,000,! \nLet me give you a solution, Michael. Let\u2019s bring ALL the jobs back that have been outsourced over the last two decades. Is this going to happen? Of course not! Michael \nLeonard: \nYes, that is why I write about \u201cfree trade\u201d and our trade deficit over and over so that people can understand what is happening. \nMichael VyseLegendaire \n\u201cAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance and at some point the safety net is going to break. \nWhat is our country going to look like when that happens?\u201d \nEgypt. We will have chaos in major metropolitan areas around the nation. Or maybe we are so drug and entertainment-infused that we will simply throw up our hands and pull down our pants for big daddy government. \nOh, and did you forget to mention the amount of people taking subsidized anti-psyochotic medication? When people suddenly come off of their expensive drugs, let us hope their violent outbursts do not reach the level of other well known mass murders associated with coming off of these SSRIs, like Sgt. Bales in Afghanistan. curt \nYes insurance costs have gone up. Why? People are unemployed. Why? Why not, their example has been an industry whose greed is boundless. Lets not forget that if only the top couple of percent of income makers paid their share it could mean clean water, education and health for everyone on this planet. Certain parties have been trying to sink this system without coming up with an alternative and why in the world would anyone not greedy want privatization of natural resourses. Its industry that\u2019s ruining this country and the greed that is their legacy. stan \nAnd on top of that, race wars and riots are coming to a city near you. This from the Black Panther: \n\u201cIf you are having any doubts about getting suited, booted, and armed up for this race war that has never ended, let me tell you something\u2026 The thing that\u2019s about to happen to these honkies, these crackers, these pigs, these pink people, these mother \u2019 turtle people \u2013 it has been long overdue.\u201d \nIf you happen to be one of them honkies, or crackers, or pig, or pink people, or mother turtle people, you might just end up dead, for no reason other than your whiteness. Nexus789 \nAmazing number of self righteous pompous individuals. The US has never had welfare state. It is more like a dependency system that has evolved to placate the masses as the US economy has declined and people have adapted to \u2018game\u2019 the system. \nWhat do you expect will happen if millions of jobs and tens of thousands of factories have been closed down and off shored to China, India, etc. What are the millions of unemployed going to do. The payments, food stamps, etc, are ways of keeping the idle masses passive. \nAt some point this will end as the US is bankrupt and austerity measures will be introduced and many of these payments will be withdrawn..no food stamps, no unemployment benefits, no medical support, etc. Then you will all get you wish and reap the consequences. Paul \ndoes a common shareholder contribute to the success of a company? \nIsn\u2019t the shareholder the true parasite? \nHe draws money out of the company and does nothing in return? Paul \nDo you have any dependents? \nYes, shareholders, managers, chairmen, bureaucrats and politicians. Paul \nIn Hong Kong, \nevery citizen has the right to medical treatment in public hospitals (only entrance fee of USD10 to be paid). \nThere is no VAT in Hong Kong. 66% of Hong Kong people do not pay any income tax. Max. income tax is 15% of gross salary. Minimum is 2% \nThe Hong Kong government does not have debts. Last year they had so much money left over, they paid every Hong Kong citizen over 18 about USD600. In addition they gave every tax payer a tax rebate of USD600. \nWhat are they doing wrong? de Malfosse \nre: \u201cEver since the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d began our debt has exploded\u201d\u2026 certain amount of accuracy in writing this BUT the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d ran alongside that other horse in the Imperial race: the Viet Nam War, and the Viet Nam War is the direct source for Americans monetary difficulties today. \nI argue the debt explosion has much, much more to do with the maintenance of Uncle Sam\u2019s Empire, an Imperium where tremendous amounts of American taxes continue to flow outward, then it does with the neighbor on welfare. \nI suggest the \u201cwelfare bum\u201d is an easy & obvious target deliberately promoted by Uncle Sam so as to divert attention from the Empire and it\u2019s 70+ year history of perpetual conflict, war, and interfernece in the affairs of other nations. \nExample: Country XXX (so as not to offend anyone) has itself received an average of 5 millions a day for more than 60 years off the American taxpayers back. Now if that doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cgov\u2019t parasite\u201d, what or who does? \nIs your neighbor on welfare more damaging then an entire company, say Lockheed-Martin, which hasn\u2019t been off the gov\u2019t teat since Truman was president? Tom Lowe \nExcellent points although they are clearly not directly related to the topic. \nWhat I actually see on the ground here is me working night and day for $800/month after 6 years of college long ago while the completely able bodied guy over there who never bothered to go to school does nothing all month but smoke dope and gets $900. NeoIsolationist \nI work. My wife worked for a long time and is now on unemployment. She would be one of that 49 percent collecting government benefits. She doesn\u2019t want to be on unemployment, and intends to vote against the current administration come November. While lots of that 49 percent wants to continue scamming the system, I\u2019d say there\u2019s some in that group like my wife who don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think 49 percent in and of itself will be enough of a percentage. I could be wrong of course, but I recall hearing that Obama wanted to get about 75 percent of the population getting some kind of government assistance. I think he would agree that 49 percent, while alot, is not enough. Michael \n\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201dIn America today, we deeply penalize hard work and we greatly reward government dependence. \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d \nsame Thing in france, for a longtime As a disabled, i could have until $1000 from government as benefits \u2026. but, no support to get a job, and once i get my own business, many taxes and no more benefits because of my disability \nstupid world chris \nGreat article Michael as usual. But imo it\u2019s overlooking a critical component to this problem: the breakdown of the family structure. I know your fully aware of this but I just thought it could use some mention. It will be a cold day in hell before I or anyone in my family accept any sort of assistance from .gov. jazzage \nYou are missing three important areas of government dependance in this article. One, the liberal blue states pay more in federal taxes than they get back. That excess goes to the conservative red states that whine about the government but could not exist without their excess of government contracts, military bases, etc. The states of the old Confederacy get almost $2 back for every dollar they pay in. Two, the greatest amount of welfare in this country is money taken by taxing the middle class to subsidize the rich and big business. An example is the private prison industry. We privatize the prisons, the private companies that run these prisons then become lobbyists to bribe the \u201clawmakers\u201d to make more laws making more things illegal so they have more prisoners and more revenue. Three, people with kids have more deductions and pay less taxes to the point where they have essentially zero taxes. Who has the most kids? Mothers on welfare, yes, but also Republicans who get away with paying little or no taxes. Guess who makes up the difference? Those of us with fewer or no kids, generally more liberal people. We also pay full freight on property taxes that fund the public schools. \nThe hypocrisy of conservative morons is astounding. I say let\u2019s get rid of public funding of schools, end all corporate welfare in all its guises, and set the losers in the Southern states out on their own and watch the size of the federal budget plummet. Gary2 \nyou are 100% correct. Michael will never acknowledge that you speak the truth as he does not let facts get in his conservative leanings. \nHow about the welfare of churches and pastors houses, err mansions being tax free. I do not want to subsidize some rich paster of a megachurch. \nPOOR Michael\u2013what ever are you goiong to do when the real facts about welfare are pointed out?? The church is the biggest welfare scam of all. jazzage \nYou are right, I forgot about the Churches that pay no taxes but yet butt their way onto every political conversation and use the power of the Church to promote their idiotic ideas. \nWelfare for those on the bottom exists to prevent rioting in the streets, and welfare for those on the top is the reason the government exists. Gary2 \nits not just churches but pastors homes. Tax payers subsidize these mega church mansions as they are also tax free. Barn Cat \nThe new gold rush is trying to qualify for SSI by being considered legally disabled. Tom Lowe \nI sprained my ankle walking to a job interview. Can I qualify for SSI?!! Dave \nHello All. \nI have been reading this blog for some time, it is good to read some non-mass media propaganda. I however do not subscribe to the notion that USA or the rest of the world will descend into anarchy overnight. It will continue to be a gradual decline over the next 3-5 years, as it has been so far. \nIt is not merely policymakers to blame, but a system that only operates on perpetal growth fuelled by cheap energy. As this energy rises in not only monetary cost,but also energy input costs, economic contraction is inevitable. \nPeak oil is definitely here. Shale and tar sands proves they\u2019re getting desperate. \nOver time, perhaps people may need to return to the rural agrarian lifestyle they had pre-indutrial age,in order to survive. But the sun will stil rise and set. \nI don\u2019t think that anarchy will come either, at least not where I live. Just a slow decay of order. Whatever happens, I would rather die helping my fellow man, content with this life I\u2019ve been lucky to have, than to go down defending my \u201cstash\u201d. \nAs for all this Dec 2012 rubbish, FYI our calendar (gregorian) ends every 400 years. Funnily enough we\u2019re still around. Another Richard \nThe Powerz that be, hold the rip cord on this Gargantuan Unpayable Debt of the USA and Europe. When they are satisfied with the ever growing level of this Debt \u2013 They will pull the rip cord on the Trillions of $ of Derivatives By The End Of 2012. That is their timeline to commence the New World Oder, I mean Order. I believe we will All be startled and frightened by the Suddeness and the Severity of the Collapse. Jack the Leper \nThe United States Government is the parasite on the hard working people. Gary2 \nJournalist Chris Mooney discusses his new book, \u201cThe Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Reject Science \u2014 and Reality.\u201d \nIn his new book, The Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Reject Science \u2014 And Reality, science journalist Chris Mooney surveys this growing body of data and explains its significance. \nI think the authors mistake is assuming republicans have a brain to begin with. chuck \nIsn\u2019t the government our biggest parasite? Michael \nThe government feeds off of hard working Americans. It\u2019s their lifeblood. Chris \nHmm\u2026 although this won\u2019t be a popular thought, I really feel that the government should not hand out a dime to anyone for any reason. This was what the church was suppose to do. It was suppose to help those, widows, disabled, poor, etc. But, in our \u201canti-Christian\u201d society now, we\u2019ve given, or better stated, expect the government to take care of these and pushed the church out. The church still should be taking care of it\u2019s own though. No matter what kinds of rules the gov\u2019t tries to push. \nAs a side note, what really burns me is that all the so-called atheists, anti-Christians, etc would try to justify that Jesus would have wanted socialism and that the government should take care or it\u2019s people via handouts. That is a completely different Bible from what I read however as the Jesus I knew was very clear about people taking care of themselves and their family. If hardship hit, then the church \u2013 more specifically, other church members (others in your congregation) were suppose to then help you out. But, sadly, most \u201cchurch\u201d goers are now so self-absorbed and Bible deficent that they aren\u2019t willing to help other church members because they think the government should. \nUgh \u2013 catch 22. \nSorry \u2013 my ramble on to a great article that hit a nerve! Eric Ferguson \nThis article is an example of why America is going into massive debt. We have gone from a nation of makers to a nation of takers. People are content to sit on their but and receive enough money from the govt to live on. Yet it is people like me who go to work to support these lazy a$$ people. nowwthen \nThis is not the country I grew up in. As I\u2019ve said before I remember the days in the 60s and 70s when anyone with a high school diploma (and many without one) could find a job with a living wage. There were smokestacks and office buildings all over the country that needed workers. Most from my generation hate that things have devolved into the semi-socialist society Michael has painted here. The corporate lobbyists have convinced our country\u2019s leaders to buy into the belief that tossing U.S. workers into a world labor pool is somehow good for us. Tens of millions of jobs have been lost as a result. Add to that the technological unemployment caused by all of the robotic and computerized replacements for human labor and it\u2019s no wonder that unemployment and underemployment remain at record levels. A person who\u2019s exhausted his or her 99 weeks of unemployment after losing a job they held for 20 years is likely to reason that \u201cthe government caused my job to go away so the government must pay me for what they took from me.\u201d I guess it\u2019s what they refer to as a \u201cmoral hazard\u201d. I\u2019d like to think that most Americans would still prefer to work at a job that paid a decent wage rather than stay on the dole. But sadly that will not happen as long as good American jobs are being eliminated by lopsided \u201cfree trade\u201d policies and productivity gains resulting from more automation with less human labor. Jeremy \nYou think clearly and make good points. Winston Smith \nthough I can agree with your assesment of lack of jobs and good paying ones at that, the problem in part is the result of your statements-we have encouraged and trained people in this nation not to be their own bosses, but employees (wage slaves) dependant on others. Guilds- destroyed largely during the \u201creformation\u201d, which then ushered in a dog-eat-dog, selfish economy, highly individualistic. Said guilds then and could now, provide training, placement, apprenticeships and benefits (health, insurance,etc). During the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, the RCC laity had land associations in the USA and Britain-due to lackluster support of clergy, none from Protestants and a depression/WW II, those died on the vine. Their purpose? to train men how to famr and then, to buy/rent a farm to provide for themselves and others. Ditchling survived, in sorts, until 1989. The men might have gotten training, but nowhere to go and nothing to buy/use/rent afterwards. They then were continually unemployed and stuck in filthy cities. \nOr many has to rely on a lot of ready cash, equity and suck to buy a franchise. A lot more to get a loan from them or a whole lot more to buy their own buisness, plus where then is training? Open a bar/grill? great, would love to do that-do not know the first thing about payroll, taxes, with holding, how and where to order products,etc\u2026. pete \nYes. This is all true and accurate information. \nHere\u2019s some more: \nAfter 27 months of being unemployed, the jobs I am being offered are for about 1/4th of my former salary, while the costs for about everything are about twice as much. \nSo, my choices are get back to work and suck it up like a good sheople\u2026..or do my best to drive a spear into the beast\u2019s heart and try to kill it. More of a mercy killing actually. \nIt boils down to this. Do you buckle down, stiff upper lip, shoulder to the wheel and nose to the grindstone\u2026..or give up? \nI\u2019m going with the idea that supporting the crooked, decietful and errant policies is a loosing game and I am going to be merciful by helping put the ailing beast (US ECONOMY)to death. Right now it\u2019s a wounded and dangerous animal. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2026.if it was possible to nurse it back to health\u2026I\u2019d be on board. However, Bernanke and the politicoes have decided that injecting growth hormones and a diet of five hour energy drinks is practicing good medicine\u2026.so am I evil by wanting to see a suffering animal put to sleep? Tom Lowe \nThis happened to me 25 years ago and I swore then to kill the Beast and I know I am going to win. Tom Lowe \nBTW I got zip in unemployment from the Corporate Pigs. \nZIP \nyou got that right\u2013the jobs are low pay walmart crap. Jeremy \nYour anger is about where I was last July. But, you are still accountable to God for your actions, and He requires that you work and do your best (Apostle Paul: if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat). \nThe misery on this website will not help you either. I used to visit this site daily, but I realized that, while providing some key facts, it is no more knowledgable of the future than you or I. \nDon\u2019t give up. Many days are difficult, but trust me, you WILL find peace in the valley, on the other side. Now I am encouraging people who actually have good jobs. THAT is service, and is a blessing. \nI take the bar exam in July, and look at it more as an adventure to where God will take me. Gemtap \nTrack what they use\u2026.make them pay it back whent they get a real job\u2026if not debtors prison! Cinderella Man \nGood topic, Michael. Now I know why my Dad gets so infuriated around tax time. When I was out of work and unemployment expired, I worked in the \u201cunderground economy\u201d paid under the table because that was the only work there was. I breifly had to get SNAP assistance cause I had no other way to feed myself. Now that Im working again reading articles like this I often have to ask myself Why do I work? Tax time pisses me off too\u2026 I already told you about the welfare mama that got back $8,000 on EIC. She also gets section 8 housing assistance, and food stamps. So basically all you have to do is produce illegetimate children, apply for aid and presto! Set for life!! Keep working fools, millions on welfare depend on you! Michael \nAlmost everyone needs help at some point, but the key is to pick yourself back up and get off of the help and that is exactly what you did. \nI don\u2019t blame those that are going through temporary troubles. But those that have gotten comfortable living off of the system year after year and they never try to get off of it trouble me. \nMichael davidmpark \nNot exactly. \nI\u2019ve been on both sides of this lately, so here\u2019s how things really work. \nI worked as a government contractor until my wife became severely disabled about 5 years ago. So, I left to get a part-time merchandising job with a big box to be closer to her and our young kids. \nThat \u201csafety net\u201d where I live is not very big. \nLIHEAP\u2019s funding, at most, is about 2 months worth of utilities per year. The paperwork cost us about $30 to process and mail, after 4 hours of filling in and photocopying. \nMedicaid is very limited to kids and the disabled \u2013 I\u2019m not covered at all. Every 3 months I have to fill out a 15 page review and send in all related documents to prove everything that I claim. Most of the time, I\u2019m either missing a document or not enough info, so it lapses for about 10 \u2013 15 days. \nSocial Security \u2013 Disability has been a trial and half! We finally got full disability after 4 years, more than 1000 documents, and a law firm. For this, it\u2019s not much; about $1100 per month. And since there really isn\u2019t housing assistance from everyone else already on that program (been on the waiting list for 4 years), almost all goes to rent. \nOur kids do an online charter school (and doing well, they can actually read and do the math! The school district is an abysmal failure), but we can\u2019t qualify for discounted (not free) internet because we have to cut service for 3 months before we can apply. We can\u2019t do that unless we let the kids fall way behind. \nWe don\u2019t qualify for the cell phone discount (again, not free) cause I\u2019m still working part-time. I need to quit to get that one; but if I do, the wife looses medical coverage and a few others. \nIt\u2019s not a fun system: and I don\u2019t spend time waiting for a check \u2013 I spend a lot of time trying to build what we can afford to create our own utilities and grow food, looking for a better job to work-from-home because, as I said before, she is severely disabled and needs me here! I get up at 5 AM, got work \u2019till 11 (if I\u2019m lucky and she doesn\u2019t have a seizure or something \u2013 then I have to stay home all day), then clean house, help the kids with school, fill out paperwork, cook what I can, and then, if I\u2019m blessed, do some stuff in the workshop and then go to bed at 12 AM. \nThis is not a paradise; it\u2019s near to hell! I don\u2019t know who is profiting so much from being on these programs, but I know it ain\u2019t us! And from the experiences while working for the federal government, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the bureaucrats running the programs that are living the sweet life! Some of those guys make over $100,000 per year salary alone and spend most of their time in meetings. Tom Lowe \nYour case just illustrates how those who really do need help have such difficulty getting it in a system clogged with rank freeloaders. \nI know numerous fully able bodied mentally competent people who get SSI of $900 +/- or large Veteran mental disability payments up to $2500 and more who do NOTHING. Most of them are actually alcoholics or pill people. \nI knew a guy who gets $2500\u2013plus SS\u2013for some concocted mental disability (PTSD from a military helicopter accident? Come on, liar-actor! This was not even in combat). He came to me on the 11th of the month whining that he was already broke. Well he has lived in a van for the past 43 years while he freeloaded off of the phony PTSD disability. So he spent $2500 in 11 days living it up to the tune of $225+ per day and shows up broke and whining on the 11th here where we self sufficient people have had way more than our share of dumpster meals just to keep this roof over our head. \nI sent him to Camp FEMA, so to speak. \nI often have to work for myself for as little as $1-$2 per hour, and have for many years now. All you out there who think there is some sort of automatic minimum wage had better realize there is no such thing if you intend to survive. davidmpark \nThanks Tom mondobeyondo \nAll one needs to do to see government efficiency at its best, is to go to the local Department of Motor Vehicles office to get your vehicle registered. There are 30 counters available. Two employees, at two counters, are assisting customers. Some 600 or so people sitting, staring at screens, or chasing their kids. Already a bad sign. \nPress the little green button on the machine near the entrance. Your ticket reads \u201cnumber 863\u2033. \nThe loudspeakers announce, \u201cNow serving number 108\u2033. \nCome on \u2013 even the Post Office is better than this! Gary2 \nthere are only 2 employees at the DMV because right wing gov like the soon to be replaced walker cut cut cut. \nStop voting repube. Diane C \nIt is really people like you who do need the help, and are not able to get enough. The problem is the entire system (government) is broke. There are those who really take advantage, and there are those who really need it. You would think because the government is so big and bloated, they would have enough people to check on these things. However you would have to be efficient in order to do that. Our government certainly is not. \nI wish you and your family the best. davidmpark davidmpark \nOkay, I need to clarify some things. \nMy wife has an actual disability: severe traumatic brain injury, that caused epilepsy and a few other things. She was in a coma for almost a year and had to relearn most everything. It will cost her her life. It\u2019s real \u2013 not easy to fake those CT scans and the other numerous tests. \nSecond, I don\u2019t know how to game this system: I give \u2019em all the requested info, they tell me what we can get. Honesty doesn\u2019t pay off with these guys: and that\u2019s the point! \nWe HATE being on these programs! Using that EBT card in public is the most embarrassing thing; and the stares the cashier gives me is just damning. I hide the card best I can when swiping it and then quickly stash the eyesore away. When the receptionist at the doc\u2019s office asks about insurance, I always whisper the answer. \nIf these gov people want to do something right and good (for once); then pass a law that voids zoning laws for families that have a legitimately disabled member. I am capable of rearing animals and producing things here, but am limited because these guys want us on castrating programs that serve themselves! \nWe have food storage, but it\u2019s pretty basic now. And as someone here mentioned: if we don\u2019t have these programs, they\u2019ll take the kids and force my wife into assisted living \u2013 a kind of partial divorce. \nThis isn\u2019t the society I wanted; this is where I\u2019m stuck! Phillip Sherwood \nThe people I personally know who \u201cwork the system\u201d aren\u2019t getting rich but just treading water since they double up with family members and work low wage jobs. If they didn\u2019t \u201cwork the system\u201d they wouldn\u2019t have enough to eat or their children wouldn\u2019t be able to access health care. Many are caught up in drug abuse or alcoholism and are hardly able to maintain themselves. Some work very hard at low wage jobs and some don\u2019t work at all. I agree at one level that throwing money at these people is worthless but cutting them off is just as bad since the children are the ones who suffer. I remember at the church I grew up in that what worked wasn\u2019t monetary policy but individual assistance and genuine caring. Our pastor went to great lengths to assist a member who had a mentally ill mother and neither the pastor nor the church got a thing out of it except the right thing was done and people knew that this man and this congregation cared. My youth pastor said \u201cam I my brothers keeper?\u201d I thought he was referring to the specific scripture and I fumbled the answer but the Bible is clear from cover to cover what the answer is. Tom Lowe \nYou missed the whole point of the article. It states that there are too many freeloaders burdening a well-intentioned system designed for the truly needy. It never says or even implies that needy people should not get help. What it says is that people who AREN\u2019T needy are robbing the system. Stan522 \nI agree with you. Government sustenance programs are over burdened. However, over burdening is inevitable. Since government defines \u201csuccess\u201d only when they can increase their budget, and/or getting as many people reliant on it, you will always grow a program of free-loaders. By definition, this will always happen. \nNow, we have politicians openly feeding people with guilt for not putting up with supporting these ridiculous programs. They equate charitable \u201cgiving\u201d of your money to private support programs to you supporting government taking your money and creating a program. They are not the same thing. Government will ALWAYS be more inefficient. Gary2 \nam I my brothers keeper \nThat passage is not in Michaels and the other \u201cChristians\u201d on this site. Stan522 \nGubamint programs are not supposed to make you rich. They are intended to keep you captive into a low level of sustenance where politicians can get you to keep voting for them as they play the system and put you into a voting block that will ensure their continued candidacy. That goes for ANY program: \nHome Mortgage Interest Deduction Hope or Lifetime Learning Tax Credit Student Loans Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit Earned Income Tax Credit Food Stamps (did I miss any\u2013?) \nNone of these will provide people with what they need. All they will do is get you hooked just like a crack addict. Tell you friend to break away from government handouts and find their own way to success. It\u2019s inside of every single one of us. It\u2019s God given and we just need to unleash it. Stan522 \nI believe we are at that point where there may be more takers than givers in our society. The politician\u2019s are now so open about how if you vote for them, they will give \u201cyou\u201d free stuff. This \u201csafety net\u201d and how politicians have leveraged it into voting blocks has destroyed our country. Their political greed (power and money) has enticed the weak to become weaker by accepting these bribes. It\u2019s immoral and should be illegal to destroy the drive for success, self-reliance, and determination out of American\u2019s. Michelle \nYou have no idea just how much that hit home. God bless you jox \nVery unfair and disappointing article! You talk about a pitiful state of things in America, and suddenly, without justification, you equates it with a \u201cEuropean-style socialist welfare\u201d that destroys your nation \u201csocially and financially\u201d. Even worse, you end with that picture, which has NOTHING to do with the content of the article. \nIf you don\u2019t like socialism, OK, let\u2019s discuss it with arguments. But this method of picking something that you don\u2019t like and associate it somehow with the socialism is very unfair and not appropriate for your otherwise brilliant articles. It is exactly the same as when the far left blames any problem in the world on America and capitalism. \nAnd, by the way, let me inform you that some of the more \u201csocially and economically\u201d advanced and prosperous countries in the world are European and socialists (or social-democrats, if this word exists in English). You are going to have a hard time finding arguments against the ethics and politics of those countries, which are a model for everybody. Tom Lowe \nEveryone but Europe knows that Europe are the biggest freeloaders in the entire world. \nThe biggest. Tom Lowe \nIn fact, Europe is nothing but a whole subcontinent wholly dedicated to freeloading off of the rest of the world, and has been for centuries now. Gary2 \nMichael is becoming an idological right wing warrior where facts are whatever he hears on fox. He can no longer think for him self. This crap was probably transcribed from rush pill head bimbo show. DownWithLibs \nI see you have even more screws loose than you did before. So sad\u2026we pity you!!!! knightowl77 \nWell they are not a model that I would like to emulate. We\u2019ll see where they are in 3 to 5 years, but I do not ever think I will support Gov\u2019ts taking from one group to provide to another\u2026. \nThat is not the role of any gov\u2019t that I would care to be subject to\u2026.you can keep it\u2026 Barn Cat \nA lot of government jobs are necessary jobs. A lot of those people are incredibly arrogant. They think they\u2019re God because they work for the government. I saw that when I worked for the Census and my superiors had to deal with people who worked for the Department of Commerce. But those people are nothing compared to God. Bobby \nthe line at 2:14 applies here\u2026 Bernadette \nEvery time I read something like this it makes my blood boil. It\u2019s this mindset which is making me fight tooth and nail to get my SSI which I worked most of my life paying into. I\u2019m dissabled now. I have a list of illnesses longer than my left arm, and SSI has denied me and now I have to try to find a way to drive 200 miles away to go to some court hearing. You people seem to think it\u2019s so easy to get gov help when you need it. It\u2019s NOT! I\u2019ve been trying to get my SSI benefits since 2009 when I finally became too sick to work. I worked for years with my illnesses, but they got too bad for me to manage in 2009 and I just couldn\u2019t do it any more. Bernadette \nBTW I would much rather be able to get up and go to work everyday like I used to. I miss working, it\u2019s ridiculous to think that people who were created to create and work would rather sit and be sick, just so that they could get a few hundred dollars every month for free. Talk about socialism, that was Hitler\u2019s mind set \u201cLet the strong survive and the weak go to the wall\u201d That\u2019s why I can\u2019t believe there are so many Believers who are against public assistance. The Church is supposed to take care of sick people like me, not the gov. The Church isn\u2019t supposed to be robbing old ladies of their SS, there supposed to be caring for them. And Christians certainly shouldn\u2019t be complaining about services to assist sick and old people. Oh well it will all come out of the wash when JESUS gets back. Even so Please come quickly Lord JESUS. Cinderella Man \nBernadette, I woundnt be mad at you for getting SSI its perfectly healthy young teenagers and 20 somethings that say they have \u201cdepression\u201d or \u201cbi-polar\u201d and get to sit around and goof off all day while the rest of us foot the bill. BTW the reason that most people are depressed is because your govt. is tyrranical and you are materialistic!! Tom Lowe \nEXACTLY!! \nAnd then there are all the phony 420 patients, PTSD phantoms, pain pill puppies, and more! Gary2 \nmost 90% Christians are hypoctrites to the max. All one need do is read this site for proof of that. Stan522 \nThey will be left behind\u2026\u2026.. Another Richard \nNo, you are wrong. All 90% Christians are hypocrites. Only 100% Christians are Truely Christian. Another news flash for you buster \u2013 Only God can see the heart of any person and He alone Knows the True from the Hypocrite. So, quit wasting your energy trying to pick who is and who isn\u2019t a True Christian,because it is useless. Examine your own life and relationship to God is the best thing you could do for yourself and others. Ozmo \nThank you so much for that post. It would do well for everyone to live by this. Just my 2 cents Stan522 \nIsn\u2019t that just like government\u2026. create programs with big promises, make it near impossible to attain, move the goal posts mid game (extending the qualifying years out farther and farther), then steal from it, bankrupt it and then pander to the voting block of retirees and near retirees to garner more votes for the ones who bastardized it in the first place. \nOur problem is \u201cwe\u201d keep believing these SOB\u2019s every time they speak. Be wary of ANY politician coming up with a gubamint program that takes care of \u201cus\u201d. Besides, there isn\u2019t enough to live on once you get it. I would have rather kept my own money for the 40+ years (and still going) instead of giving it to the ripoff artists. \nMy beef is not with you who worked their whole life and believed the promises of politicians. My issue is with bastard (redundant) politicians that make false promises and then leverage votes promising more free \u201cstuff\u201d. They all can go straight to hell\u2026\u2026 mondobeyondo \nRemember that scene in the movie \u201cTitanic\u201d, where Jack asks Rose to hold onto her hand as the ship sinks? \n\u201cYou jump, I jump!\u201d No, wrong scene! It\u2019s the scene where the ship is taking the final plunge to the bottom. The undertow would have sucked anyone near the ship under water. \nThe USA is the Titanic. The people abusing the system, depend on the U.S. government for their survival. They will be dragged underwater. (Some of them already are. \u201cUnderwater mortgages\u201d.. wink, wink!) And they will suck everyone else under along with them. Chris \nIn the pyramid of wealth that could describe the population you would have parasites at the very top and at the bottom. At the very top the 1% also live a parasitic existence. I mean people like bankers/ CEOs and others who produce nothing and get rich by scamming those below and basically living a parasitic existence on those that actually do work, the middle of the pyramid. Under the middle there is a large population of an underclass some of whom are genuine hardworking people and some who game the system. The middle supports the lower and the upper parts of the pyramid. A host can only support a certain amount of its energy going to a parasite living on it. Too much energy lost and too many parasites and the host will be killed. This stage must be getting close. Those at the top with their corruption and fraud and greed set the example for those below to follow. When faced with corruption at the top and indolence below the middle will lose heart, see it\u2019s supporting a unjust system and may give up. CitizenS \nBeen a Paramedic for 21 years now and I have continually see things worsening. People used to call for EMS when they or a loved one was sick, now it seems we\u2019re just a \u2018free\u2019 taxi service. Sadly they don\u2019t realize or care that while they are being hauled around someone may actually need our service. And even though they aren\u2019t paying foir it\u2026\u2026.. I AM!!! I\u2019m all about giving a people a hand up, but I\u2019m getting tired of a third of my pay going to buy them cell phone minutes and the like. I built my own house payday to payday and I own the land. My family and I are putting up feeder pigs and a calf and just broke the sod on 2 acres of ground for a garden. We have wind power when there\u2019s a breeze and 3 underground springs on site. By all means let it collapse. Then these parasites will be forced to work!! Again Michael, good article. Michael \nThey use you for a free taxi service? \nThat is just sad. \nMichael CitizenS \nIn this state (WV) an individual can activate EMS, not give a reason, and state which hospital they want to go to and we have to take them. They do not even have to give us there name if they so choose. We call it a \u2018you call we haul\u2019. And on top of that many use the non emergency ambulances because they don\u2019t want to spend the money on gas or the bus to go to Dr. Visits and other non urgent medicals. I love my state and only wish that we and other states would reform our system. That by itself could save countless money and lives\u2026.. the optimist \nOh Yay for you. Don\u2019t you get it \u2014 you built your house paycheck to paycheck \u2014 there are millions of us out here who don\u2019t have the paycheck! And we don\u2019t because of the CEO parasites and 1% parasites who are all about churning and grabbing money over jobs. Outsourcing, golden parachutes, whatever, the jobs are gone and they aren\u2019t coming back. \nDon\u2019t be so grossly smug and superior. I just lost my house, which was my prepping homestead. I did all those homesteading things for years too, but without a good source of income, when my business failed 2 years ago, I lost it. DON\u2019T think for a SINGLE SECOND that you are invulnerable and incapable of losing YOUR paycheck \u2014 YOU CAN LOSE IT ALL. \nThen maybe you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of reality. \n\u201cThen these parasites will be forced to work!!\u201d \nHateful. Don\u2019t you think \u201cwe\u201d WANT to have jobs?? FOOL, hateful fool. Please read Karol\u2019s comment below. The real parasites are at the top, in DC and in corporate boardrooms. CitizenS \nIf smug and being a fool means harsh austerity @ home (eating ramen, bologna sandwiches, working by myself til 3 in the morning on my house then getting up to be @ work @ 0800 (in which I couldn\u2019t even claim the $8000 tax credit because I didn\u2019t borrow from the banksters), and scratching odd jobs on days off) is smug then I guess that shoe fits. Did I work the system? No. Do I live in the lap of luxury? No. Have I gone without to provide a roof and food for my family? Yes. Am I prepared for what is coming? I hope so. I feel for anyone that looses their job, I really do, I\u2019ve been there before. My comment was not meant to be condescending towards anyone. But I will say this and its as timeless today as it ever has been\u2026\u2026. Judge only a man after you have traveled in his footsteps. libertyin413 \nIn the interest of not repeating what others have said, I would just like to add that I don\u2019t believe that we should have any of these government \u201cbenefits\u201d or \u201csafety nets\u201d at all. The only thing the government can to is tax (read:steal) from producers and assist (read:redistribute) others. And it\u2019s not just the \u201cpoor\u201d receiving benefits/entitlement [sic], the connected elite get their welfare too. Government setting up these safety nets only exacerbates any problem that may have existed because now prices skyrocket as providers know any increase will be backed by the full faith and credit of the US Tax Payer; this hurts the very people the program was intended to help in the first place. All assistance should be done by private local charity as it was before. This way it is truly just a temporary helping hand when someone hits hard times and the organization/church can monitor for fraud. For the Progressives who claim this doesn\u2019t work, we never read about having to step over alternating piles of child prostitutes and dying old people in the street as you tried to make your way to your sweatshop job. The standard of living was increasing like history has never seen before when people were allowed to keep the fruits of their own labor (a one income household could support 5-6 people, children were being better educated, new cars & appliances, etc\u2026). Now under the Progressive model the standard of living is decreasing drastically as once again everyone has to contribute to the household income and the need to hop on the safety net has reached unprecedented levels. Lastly, even if the producers are lucky enough to retain some of their earnings and try to defer some of it for later consumption, they are hit again with the hidden tax of inflation that destroys their wealth and actually decreases their purchasing power. All of this made possible through the criminal and malevolent actions of the Federal Reserve. Karol \nHi Michael, Thank you for writing such honest and informative articles. I no longer watch the news or read the local papers because it is mostly all rubbish. Your website is fascinating and I have recommended your site to all my friends and family. No body likes a lazy cheat who games the system for a living, but I am fed up with the parasitical Wall Street Fat Cats, the Politicians, the criminals in D.C. And the 1%, who having been gaming the system for decades at our expense. These rich crooks have stolen billions from the American people, far more than the food stamp family ever will in a life time. BofA paid no federal tax in 2010 and got a billion dollar rebate as well, and I read that they paid no federal tax in 2011 either. When companies that make billions of dollars and give out millions of dollars in bonuses every year don\u2019t pay federal or state tax then the tax payer is robbed. On a local level police and fire stations are affected, schools too. Bridges and roads aren\u2019t being repaired. These parasites send their children to the best schools, they vacation all over the world, own multiple homes with tennis courts and pools, multiple cars and jets, they get to eat the best food, probably cooked by the in-house chef, they have housekeepers and nannies, they have the best health care money can buy, I could go on and on. Disney, a multi-billionaire company, got welfare for a fireworks display and multi-millionaire Sam Donaldson got welfare for mohair. Really! Our schools suck, minimum wage adjusted to inflation should be $22.50 an hour, people are getting screwed out of time-and-a-half, over-time, vacation time, their pensions, health care, etc. And if you work you are lucky if you can get 20 hours a week! Wage theft is the best way for the 1% to steal from the 99%. Most people are so Ignorant they don\u2019t even realize they are being robbed. I worked for the 1% in a private club in Boston, they docked my paycheck for 3 weeks of work. I am a poor single mother, and the richest people felt the need to steal 3 weeks of my wages. Wow! I couldn\u2019t afford to work for free so I had to quit. Do I begrudge the obese, lazy, and unmotivated for scamming the system? Not really. Especially since there ain\u2019t a Benz or a Jag in their driveway, no lawn service for their patch of grass, or a maid to clean up after their sub-par, high-fructose, hydrogenated, sodium laced, junk food dinners, and if they get fuel assistance to keep warm while eating their food-stamp dinner and watching Judge Judy, then good for them. Michael \nKarol: \nYes, I have written many articles about the corruption of the banksters and the elite as well. \nI am definitely not on their side. \nMichael Mr. G \nYou are largely right, Karol. Many people who are not doing well would do far better if they were dishonest. \nThat\u2019s what bothers me about the US today \u2013 no real earned privilege, just lots and lots of unearned, unfair big cash going to some fat-cats who are RUINING THE COUNTRY at the same time they are getting all that money! I mean, they could at least do a good job for all that cash. I don\u2019t think they even try, really. \nGood luck! Jimmy \nOnce citizens find out that they can vote themselves MONEY (i.e. the democratic party and has already occured) the system is heading straight to hell and is destined for failure. kHRIStu4 \nTo honestly fix problems like this we need free energy. It is possible, just held up by corporations(owned by bankers) who own the government. Its all about control. This is one more thing added to the list to divide people and keep them docile. \nIts a long movie (about 2hr). Some stuff may be way out there but have an opened mind. It describes the \u201cfood chain\u201d of banks, corporations, governments and people as well. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEV5AFFcZ-s grandpa \nThese parasites you speak of live from the miniscule turds dispersed by the leeches that thrive on 95% of the oxygen you burn\u2026 so now we have rich vs poor. black vs white,, and gov vs god\u2026 someday people may get the balls to reverse the genocide being played upon us all.. Corey Lewis \nWOW! What a great article! Loved it! My ex-wife has been one of these friggin parasites for 15 years and doing her best to raise my kids in that lifestyle\u2026over my dead and rotting body I say. People who have never worked hard or refuse to work hard do not deserve to have residency in this country. Put them all on a boat and ship them off. I\u2019ll even pilot the boat. Rick \nI know of at least one parasite in particular that lived off my older sister for many years. After she finally divorced the leach, he\u2019s now on government subsistence. These type of people all have one thing in common; they just are not employable. Stan522 \n\u2026..and the rest of them have government jobs\u2026. have you ever been to the DMV\u2013? Nobody Special \nThe Low-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act was introduced in 2005. Fortunately, it hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since then. \nDon\u2019t mention it \u2013 let\u2019s not give them the idea to revive it. Mike S. \nWhen a person loses their job the first thing you do is apply for unemployment. After that runs out and your savings run out and your food runs out and you have kids. Do you honestly think the government will let you live off dehydrated food that is on the shelf in the basement? You will be on foodstamps and medicaid or they WILL take your kids! If you can\u2019t show proof of income, regardless of my house paid for and enough money(at the time)to pay my bills for another year. The first time you take you kids to E.R. for something it opens up a whole crap of worms if you don\u2019t have insurence. Just for stitches from a bike accident I now have my kids on Medicaid and foodstamps. I try to be positive about the government waste and use all they give on foodstamps to restock my shelves for the next go around. I will be pleased to answer any questions about my situation, even negative ones. I get on this site daily and this is my first comment. Michael \nYou make some very good points there. \nMichael Tom Lowe \nYou are not the person we are talking about. We are talking about lots of fully able bodied people who not only scam for all the gummint benefits but who also work in the underground economy year in and year out. tex \nYeah you hypocrites are always talking about some other person- not the person in front of you who has real need. \nYes there are abusers- but in my experience most people would rather work for their money walking to work over broken glass than jump through all of the hoops the bureaucracy demands for their meager pittance. \nThe fact is that the US economy is in the toilet and the sheeple are going to let Romney flush it. There are not enough jobs, not even in the cash economy. $6 to $10 an hour jobs won\u2019t pay the rent and feed a man\u2019s kids. \nWhen there is no alternative, people will work the government system to eat or they will turn to crime or justice in the streets- and there are not enough guns in this country to turn that tide once it starts. \nI think it is time quit with the rhetoric and get real- or it is all going to end very badly for us all. mondobeyondo \nI forgot about the kids aspect of the situation (I do not have children). \nWhoa\u2026 talk about growing up fast! Children in these dire situations don\u2019t need to ask what a \u201cbudget\u201d is. erheault \nAs we wander down the road to total automation in our industrys the need for middle and lower semi skilled labor will dwindle and the unemployed and the unable to work will multiply we will face a revolt as all other nation in the past and present have or now undergoing, How this will work out is unknown but it will happen to us, it dont matter who is president or in congress. no nation or country in history has survived by devaluing their monies or massive unemployment which is where we are heading, Enjot the ride as it will be historic to say the least. Bryan \nit\u2019s simple people our nation has gotten so far from God that we are reaping what we are sowing it\u2019s only a matter of time before the Lord Jesus Christ returns the mark of the beast is coming! don\u2019t be here for it after seeing how the U.S.A has mare debt than most of the european countries alone and look what is happening to them only a matter of time\u2026how much only The Lord knows wheter you believe or not it is amazing to see prophecy being fullfilled right in front of our eyes who will fix this huge world financial mess!!! read revelations chapter 13 turn your hearts to God while will still live in this age of grace! monk \nCut down on spending.

Later.We Tom Lowe \nI\u2019m a landlord in a lower middle class neighborhood, and down to 105 lb from 135 lb in 2007 for lack of food and time to cook it. There is almost nothing but professional freeloaders for as far as the eye can see from here. I could tell all of you stories about freeloaders that would make your blood boil right off. My only hope is that the gummint finally stops issuing the by-now absurd freeloader checks and benefits and sends all of the professional freeloaders to Camp FEMA, right next to the bankster criminals and right where they all belong until they get off their dead butts and start doing something for themselves. And I don\u2019t mean maybe! Cinderella Man \nMy goodness man!! You need to bulk up on protien powders and high fructose corn syrup immedietly!! 105?? Thats skinny!! no offense. Tom Lowe \nIt\u2019s scary. I\u2019m surrounded by a sea of human sinkers. That means I have to do everything for myself and half of what they need done for themselves. There\u2019s just not enough time or money to eat well enough\u2013especially after all the coffee, cigs, feeding several spoilt cats, and whatever else I might decide to indulge in, like several hours of reading blog comments. \nOK\u2013so ya caught me! !!!! Eva \nYup, it\u2019s not a good time for jobs or growth or prosperity and it won\u2019t be until we get rid of the man in the Oval Office and replace him with someone who takes creating a business-friendly environment seriously. And returning Congress to baseline budgeting. They haven\u2019t been since the 1974 Budget Reform Act, which adds 10% annually to each federal budget regardless of necessity and I hardly need add regardless of federal revenue. sharonsj \nArticles like this piss me off. Right-wingers like to blame anybody who is struggling to survive\u2013but they never attack corporate welfare. \nExxonMobil earned $5 billion a year for the past four years and not only paid no tax but got a tax refund! Corporations get away with murder and rob us blind, but their execs are not in prison, are they? But let some guy steal food from a grocer cause he can\u2019t afford to buy meat and he lands in jail. \nI don\u2019t know why I remain amazed at the stupidity of the American public to swallow Republican talking points, but I am. If you folks don\u2019t learn how to look up facts on your computers, instead of being yes men, you\u2019ll help the Repubs steal what\u2019s left of the country. Michael \nI have written quite a bit about the corporations that pay no taxes and about all of the corporate welfare that takes place. \nMichael Gary2 \n100 articles on the poor to 1 on the corporate welfare. Come on Michael\u2013I see through your bs. Michael \nGary you know that I hit Goldman Sachs far harder than I hit the poor. \nMichael Gary2 \nI said corporate welfare not just goldman sucks. and no you bash the poor way more than the corporate welfare which is a FAR bigger cost. sharonsj \nEconomist Richard Wolff pointed out that over the last 30 years, corporations (along with government) have rigged the system so that they now pay only 25 cents in taxes for each $1 of tax paid by the average citizen. He also said that if people understood how they were being screwed we\u2019d have a second American revolution. Michael \nYes, I discussed corporate taxation quite a bit in the article I just posted. \nMichael Winston Smith \nTrue, but that never seems to upset \u201cconservatives\u201d, who benefit a lot from Big Govt/Big Biz.Their answer? Just lower taxes (but not spending) and \u201cget the Govt out of the way\u201d. El Pollo de Oro \n\u201cI call them GC\u2019s three Gs: guns, gold and a getaway plan.\u201d\u2014Gerald Celente \nMichael T. Snyder write: \u201cAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance, and at some point, the safety net is going to break.\u201d Yes, and when it does break, God help The Banana Republic of America (formerly the USA). That\u2019s when things are going to get really nasty in this Third World nightmare. I\u2019ve often said that when the going gets tough, the desperate do desperate things. They rob, they steal, they sell drugs, they mug, they carjack, they kidnap. They do all the things that make it so dangerous to live in Caracas, Ciudad Juarez, Port Moresby, Guatemala City, Kingston and a long list of other Third World cities with high rates of violent crime. They collect the dreaded Desperate People Doing Desperate Things Tax (DPDDTT), which is what the wealthy minority end up paying when they\u2019re surrounded by a dirt-poor majority. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think people realize just how evil and what an abomination our country has become.\u201d\u2014Alex Jones \n\u201cAmerica\u2019s not the same place it used to be. And when you look at the decline going on in this country, how anybody can believe that the dollar is going to be a reserve currency is beyond me.\u201d\u2014Gerald Celente \nNot all Third World countries are ultra-dangerous. I\u2019ve visited Morocco, which has a lot of poverty but doesn\u2019t have a lot of violent crime (only a lot of touts trying to sell you a carpet that you don\u2019t need). But I definitely see the BRA moving in the direction of the really violent and dangerous Third World countries, where kidnappings are a way of life and the cops are often in cahoots with the thugs. So if you think Baltimore, Detroit, Philadelphia and St. Louis are bad now, just wait\u2014the worst is yet to come. And rural places aren\u2019t necessarily going to be all that safe either when the you-know-what hits the fan (some small towns in Mexico are extremely dangerous). \nOf course, smart preppers understand all these things. They\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve been listening to Alex Jones, Gerald Celente, Paul Craig Roberts, Gary Johnson and Ron Paul and realize that those guys aren\u2019t alarmists\u2014they\u2019re telling it like it is, and the truth ain\u2019t pretty. \nIf you have a gun, I recommend keeping it in a safe, secure place and knowing how to use it. That gun will come in handy when the DPDDTT collectors come a knockin\u2019 here in The Banana Republic of America. William \nThe real government \u201cparasites\u201d are actually 90% of all federal workers (GS & WG). These federal employees are grossly OVERPAID, and do little work. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to fire one of these slackers once they get tenure. My brother-in-law retired as a GS-14. In his last job in Wash DC, he TOOK NEWSPAPERS and MAGAZINES to work to read BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO Most civil service and wage grade federal workers sit around doing very little except for reading their benefits manual. That is a HARD FACT! TX4Life \nMost have tv\u2019s in their offices, paid for by the taxpayer, that they watch several hours a day. No one wants confrontation so they ignore it. Or they let it go because they also watch tv a good portion of the day. Some work other jobs during their required GS/WG hours even though it is prohibited. Again, no one wants confrontation so they look the other way. Some come and go as they please, never listing time off on their weekly time cards as required. At the end of the year, they take most of December off to \u201cuse or lose\u201d their accumulated \u201ctime off\u201d. It will continue and grow worse because no one is willing to do anything about it. Me \n$50,000 * 0.3 = $15,000 where 0.3 = 30% tax rate. \n$50,000 \u2013 $15,000 = $35,000 /12 = $2916 a month. \n$2916. \nNot $4000. $2916. It\u2019s even crazier than you think. By quite a wide margin. \nAdd to that I\u2019d love to see you find a rent of $1000 in Los Angeles. Anywhere. \nTry it. \nMinimum is $1400 and that\u2019s if you\u2019re living in hell with a bed that folds up into the wall. \nI\u2019m seriously considering building a cabin on some nice land in the middle of nowhere and buying a 20 year supply of Ramen noodles. I hear you can\u2026\u201cfeed\u201d (if it can be called such a thing) yourself on them for $142 a YEAR. Mr. G \nI have known plenty who are parasites. They really do work the system amazingly well. I once worked a charity-related job in a city where I found that people coming from Latin-American countries had welfare forms filled out before they even got on the plane to come here. That\u2019s rotten. \nBut it is also rotten that those who really try often can\u2019t get any help at all! That is why I know much welfare is a scam. We should be willing to help those who need it and deserve it. But, we tend to help those who don\u2019t deserve it. \nFor example, many poor American kids who can\u2019t read get no special help, while foreign nationals who are going here while their parents get educated or work fancy professional jobs get special English tutors on the tax-payers\u2019 dime. When are we going to wake up and help those we should? \nBut never, never turn against helping those who have it coming. This is one reason I cannot even support Republicans anymore. (I never did support Democrats) Too mean-spirited, too many people who have never been down and out! DaytoDay \nGood Article Michael, \nI had to take some time away from the doom and gloom for a while, although, it is impossible to escape it entirely. \nI agree with this article, I know people 1st hand who are on welfare, some in my own family who have been on welfare/govt assistance most of their adult lives. \nI worked at Walmart at one time, and one of the guys I worked with used to be a construction worker and was on welfare for 2yrs before they cut him off, he was receiving $1,000/month while on welfare compared to the $800/month working at Walmart. \nSo, I can understand why some people choose to leach off the system \u201cforever\u201d, because it literally pays more to be dependent than independent\u2026 \nStay Strong and Keep Up the Good Work! David Gurney \nNew GOP slogan:If you believe in hope,you must be a dope. Mad Max \nThe truth is, none of us really have to work hard anymore. Why get mad at the people who discovered that first. Only a sucker wants to work hard. Work is just a modern extension of slavery from ancient times. That\u2019s why people want to become rich. Because they want to be free. Free to do what they want when they please. Only a jaded fool wants to work hard, and only a jaded fool would criticize others that don\u2019t want to kill themselves making someone else\u2019s dream come true. I\u2019d rather spend more time with my family and doing the things I really love to do. Do you think the 1% care about working their butts off, NO! They care about working your butts off.

Women bankrupted America. They sucked the system dry with all of their special women\u2019s rights and privledges, and also they drove away all of the big corporations who are afraid of frivilous lawsuits from women. \nAmerican women are sue-happy. They will sue a company or their employer for the stupidest of reasons. So can you really blame the corporations for outsourcing to countries that are not so radical feminist-like? \nAmerican women are the main ones that destroyed America. Feminism destroyed America. \nWhen are you going to start blaming the real culprits, Michael? When are you going to grow some balls and start speaking the TRUTH, instead of watering it down like a ? Michael \nMichael John Rambo \nYes but you RARELY call out WOMEN and FEMINISTS as being the main cause behind the economic collapse of America. \nAlso, American women destroyed TENS OF MILLIONS of men\u2019s lives FINANCIALLY through the divorce courts. \nSo financially destroying TENS OF MILLIONS of men\u2019s lives didn\u2019t help the economy either. \nWhen are you going to directly expose the WOMEN as the primary culprits behind this collapse? tex \nJoh Rambo?

Nobody is going to fill up a car 6 times a month here if they are employed. Try double that. \nSame goes for a $1000 a month rent or mortgage. That will barely get you a single in the worst area of the city. \nOne person could not make it under those circumstances. A family of four can completely forget about it, unless they all live in the car and eat out of the 7-11 they park behind. Once you add in insurances, health coverage, car maintenance, etc. you\u2019d have to quadruple that $4000 figure for that size family to even pretend it was comfortable.

This article is a shill for the fat cat rich who are so greedy that they would take social security from people who earned it and benefits from people who truly need it. \nWe never hear about the lazy government union parasites in these type of articles because thats what the real parasites who run america want to keep going. \nEven when these government employees were \u201clayed off\u201d they got full pay and benefits and did not have to apply for unemployment like private sector. Always getting some special privilege including the right to a paycheck without working. This amounts to alot of money payed for nothing and far exceeds the amount anyone receiving government benefits gets. \nAre they to work or just fill space and stand around and look stupid. Most of these \u201cjobs\u201d are not necessary but work to keep the corrupt political machine going. \nGovernment employees are a lazy pack of overpayed,overprivileged spoiled brats who think everything in life should be handed to them on a silver platter. Yet not one word will be uttered against them by their elite masters while these same masters seek to make the lives of those forced onto government benefits more miserable. Another attempt at class warfare. tom singa \nthat can\u2019t get fired! James \nThe Hard Working American vs. The Government Parasite \u2013 that\u2019s a good one.

The Indians would never have understood that a person must continually pay to live on the piece of ground they were born on. So to those of you who think you are more noble for working and the poor are despicable \u2013 i say its because of you that the system keeps functioning and so its on your head. If people all thought like me then the system would end tomorrow. But they don\u2019t \u2013 so those of you who support it \u2013 its your mess so you deal with it and i will take what I can, because no man has the right to demand payment of me to live on the land so I have to take steps to circumvent the crime of what most of the rest of you created and continue to support. And by the way \u2013 this disdain for the poor \u201cparasites\u201d is one more psyop your rich masters are running on you to divide the lower and middle classes. nowwthen \nI guess if you try hard enough you can justify your disdain for taking care of yourself. Just throw in some nonsense about \u201cThe Indians\u201d and paid work as slavery and all of a sudden you\u2019re smarter than any self-sufficient man or woman and entitled to what you take from them.

I am all for taking care of my own needs \u2013 but they stole the land and put us in cages and its now illegal to do so. A person has to have satanic blood tickets to do any trade. I curse it and refuse to be a good little obedient slave. so yeah, i will take what they give until the rest of you come to your senses. And remember that disdain for those on the government \u201cdole\u201d will not serve you as your turn is coming. Pray your envious demographic has not demonized the poor by that point so that you are just put in a work camp. Mr. G \nYou are so right, James! WE really don\u2019t need so much labor to make the world run \u2013 and much of our labor goes to supporting people above us, who want want want. I live happily in a lifestyle from the 1930\u2019s. It is a very full life and I have a great many hobbies and interests which do not require constant outlays of money, though oddly others who do the same things spend constantly and don\u2019t actually DO the things too much anymore. \nI can live like this, why can\u2019t they? And if they want more, fine by me \u2013 but they ought to work like dogs to produce their plastic crap, not enslave the little people! Mr. G Jeremy \nLots of anger in these comments.

Aren\u2019t several southern conservative states among the top recipients of government aid for its citizens? Such states as Alabama and Mississippi have extremely high numbers of people on welfare. So, saying that this is a \u201cliberal\u201d problem is just being divisive. Please, keep objective in your reporting; it would lend more credibility to your articles, especially to those of us who are in the middle (like myself) or liberal (like Gary2), and not hard-core conservatives.

She\u2019ll be quite surprised. \nI\u2019m self employed and semi-retired at 48 from a business mowing lawns where I broke a sweat every day. But what do we know, eh? It\u2019s impossible to achieve anything without a govn\u2019t check. What an ignorant statement. tom singa \noh there you have it a cash based business running under the table not paying his fair share, can you please tell me the name of your lawn care, Id like to report it to the IRS Tim \nYes I hear that all of the time. But look at the populations of those countries, take Norway for example. Population ~5 million. the US ~311 million. And did you know that Norway is an oil country? Without their oil their economy would probably stagnate. You are comparing apples to oranges my friend and your argument about those countries being better is not looking at all of the factors. Oil country= $$$ Marcus \nWe spend less than we earn. Simple as that. Sweden is not an oil country! And we are not socialist, study our economy before ranting please! We are market driven economies with a strong governmental influence. Which is not a problem for most of us, since we consider the government to be our servants, while americans consider the government their enemy. \nSometimes it feels like America aimed for freedom and ended up with anarchy. And I don\u00b4t hate the USA, but I expected more from you. 20 years ago people in Europe dreamed of California, now they dream of The Emirates, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada. Benjik Cherenkov \nThis is retarded. Americans should only be so lucky as to have a higher standard of living, better health care for less, better education, more cultural events, more vacations days by at least double, and governments who weren\u2019t in the pockets of the corporations. Gosh what a terrible thing. All this and you get to vote in a parliamentary system where your views might actually be represented instead of co-opted by politicians owned lock, stock, and barrel by the corporate elites. \nAnyone who believes this stupid story deserves the crappy American life they get. Gary2 \nMichael\u2013are you listening..your libertarian is just that a dream. tom singa \nspoken like a true piss antt mooch Bob Marshall \nEuropean-style socialism \u201cis exactly what we need now.

I think this propaganda that government involvement is always bad has been very successful-but also very harmful to our society.\u201d George Soros. \nIf you are trying to defend this it is because you are in the 49 % without a doubt!!! tom singa \na true mooch! Mia \nTypical liberal!! Fox news is the the only channel that make sense and I`m glad I do not believe the fairytale of change the liberal leaders want us to believe. The American Dream is dying because of Marxism. Go ahead, nobody can change you anyway\u2026 go sit in your couch get all the free money you want from the govt. You don`t care if the hardworking taxpayers suffer because all you libs care is yourself. Lee \nDo you even know the ideology behind Marxism or the \u2018American Dream\u2019? When you find out, come back and explain how it has killed the American Dream. In fact, as a loyal follower of Fox, in your own words, explain the difference between a liberalism and conservitism. \nAs shown by your lack of knowledge, I will assume you did not attend college, but if you did how did you pay for it?

Most everyone on welfare, snap, medicaid are \u201cgaming\u201d the system. I can quit my job tomorrow, or better yet, be willfully fired. Apply for my \u201csocialist\u201d benefits, and voila, I\u2019m living the high life? Rollin\u2019 in my caddy, wakin\u2019 up at noon, heading down to the store and buying steaks for me and my girl, drinking and smoking to the wee hours of the morn, wake up at 1 in the afternoon and do it all over again, ad infinitum? WHERE DO I SIGN UP?!?! \nOr the other option, we get rid of the \u201cbenefits\u201d that these people are living off of and demand that these folks go get jobs that don\u2019t exist? \nI think you shouldn\u2019t quit your day job, though maybe you should go work in a soup kitchen one day and see how well these folks you are blaming for your woes are truly living. tom singa \nSong as your willing to live in a dump, or share a nice home wiht a few others doing he same thing. better yet you can even own that home and charge the \u201croomies\u201d rent in cash! JF \nI work in Los Angeles (I live 1 hour away-thank God) as a Parole Agent. Many parolees are claiming a mental health ailment (Depression, hearing voices) and then sign up and receive SSI. Usually just below $900.00 dollars per month (many receive \u201cback pay\u201d which can be several thousand $). They also receive housing rental assistance, and EBT food cards. They lounge around all day and then buy alcohol and drugs with the money. This does not include all of the other freeloaders (Hoodrats-girls, having multiple children, illegals etc) who receive the same freebies. Los Angeles is a total mess and California itself is the same. The collapse is gonna be hard, and I see many cities erupting in violence and bloody riots when this occurs. hora \nSSI 900$ you said? well I am 65 retired and disable and get 350$. Now for sure a systems will collapse and very soon. 750$ SS and SSI what I collect I was working and paid taxes. Now when collapse sure a lot will stop get any check free, only real disable and older will keep a own money for was paid for long time, and riot? well that will a end of DEM KKK Party. InYoFace \nGo back to Mexico you are part of the problem Anonymous \nI will say say this\u2026 $4000 per month is MORE than enough to support a family of 5 people. \nThe problem with most Americans is they are not savvy or frugal. They are poor at micro managing and quite honestly, many suffer from narcissism and addiction. \nMany Americans live their lives ignorant of how their tools work, such as; automobiles, home appliances, computers, clothing, their own bodies. \nIf a family of 5 cannot live off of $4000 per month, they might be terrible at management, likely spending heavily on things they do NOT need to survive. Buying in excess of expensive food, luxury items, luxury clothing and accessories, cigarettes, drugs, bars, new automobiles, automobiles with poor gas mileage. \nOf course many Americans are bred in the system to believe that they were not be socially accepted if they do not own new cars, new houses, new clothes, new appliances, worship sports teams\u2026 \nThe future of many Americans will likely end up as a giant temper tantrum, with riots\u2026 followed by scores of military hosing them down and telling them to \u201cshut the fuck up and deal with it.\u201d \nI\u2019m not going to judge people, but it\u2019s the truth, people need to micro manage their lives better, not be lazy and learn how to care for their bodies and their tools. tom singa \njust had a conversation about this, how to cut back, but they cant live without a $120+ cable bill a mo, their landline with internet access, two smart phones at almost 200 a mo, I explain to them even turning up the AC o 81 or 82 during the day and no lower than 78 at night will cut that bill some 40 or more a mo, (they cant sleep if its not set at 70 degrees, My gosh, and these people thing tthey are entitled tto get GOC help! and they do! Jan Honeycutt \nThe National Guard requires my husband to have internet access and we have to pay it out of pocket. I coupon constantly, my kids get clearance clothes that are cheaper than Walmart its worth the hunt. We have about 950 a month come in after taxes every other week before taxes 1400, we have honestly needed help before and deserved it, and couldn\u2019t get it. My husband had to have surgery to remove a tumor luckily it wasn\u2019t cancerous, but he was still out of work and our insurance left us with a 1,000 dollar copay. I was in the ICU at the time of his surgery complications from a heart condition, a UTI, and extreme IBS. He ended up going back to work early, we have medical bills coming in everyday despite paying for 2 insurances. Both of our children have asthma, I have several bad health problems, and our daughter has extreme IBS and GERD on top of her asthma. I worked everyday I would now it just isn\u2019t possible and I can\u2019t get a penny of the disability I paid in despite having a non working bladder, heart condition, and epilepsy, while I watch healthy people walk around on it for Fibromyalgia and I even know of one government moocher getting 800 a month because her daughter has dyslexia! On top of that most of these people have never worked or paid a penny into disability! Our daughter has dyslexia and I would rather not manipulate the system to use my daughter as a pay check, these people have no integrity. I will admit we do have to keep our air on 71 at night due to my heart condition if I get too hot my heart rate goes up but blood pressure plummets, I seriously doubt most of the people getting their bills paid have a real need to keep their air low though, they just know they can. My husband works at a factory but he has an education and he is a staff sergeant in the Guard but still we only gross a round 42,000 a yr and one time while he was on orders he didn\u2019t get paid until a week later because of the system being down, we had to use credit cards and ask family for money. My husband only gets 2 sick days a yr I was in the hospital over 10 days last yr. We desperately needed help and because my husband is home now his 3 tours of duty count for nothing and we could not get military aid. We sunk to the ultimate low of applying for food stamps just to get a through a few months and were denied. We get cut out the wazoo to support people who refuse to help themselves, and when we needed help the door was slammed in our face. Now we\u2019re drowning in more debt due to 401k loans and credit cards we had to use during the hard times we were also forced to refinance to an armed interest rate to get by, I really hope it is easy to refinance out of it as we were told, but I doubt it, and we had no choice. Our government is horribly flawed. What this article is saying is that 4,000 a month is before taxes not after if we got half of the taxes we pay monthly we would be fine. Ken Sack \nThe problem wouldn\u2019t exist if people lived by the letter and spirit (no freeies from the government)of the law: Thou shalt not steal. Max Power \nUnfortunately, most Americans would rather commit mass suicide than see a single high paid multi-generational government neopot lose their job or pension. \nIn the US, there are literally hundreds of thousands of people who have US citizenship \u2014 but who are banned from the workforce by law, statute and regulation. Each person in this situation costs the government at multiple levels millions of dollars. \nPossibly up to 5% of the US debt burden at all levels is exacerbated by this problem \u2014 and nepotism, favoritism and cronyism do the rest\u2026 \nAnyway, here is an example of a Canadian with US Citizenship but banned from any kind of employment due to their nationality. Max Power \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/Australian-marry-preg/ Brunot \nScandinavian countries can do ok with socialism because of their high functioning populace. They\u2019re smarter and have a better culture in terms of work ethic, norms about work, etc, on average. They also live in tiny homes and drive tiny cars to achieve some of this \u201cprosperity\u201d. They also don\u2019t have much military spending, which is why they were conquered in a few weeks the last time anyone tried. A uniform ethnic makeup has helped with cultural issues of socialism as well, though this is changing. \nThere is also something to be said for the way socialist programs are administered. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to beat us at that. \nThe fact is, before the 60\u2019s welfare state we had virtually no debt problem. That is a FACT. \nWe are not Trillions in debt because of free markets and lack of government programs. That is a ridiculous leap of logic. Buckaroo Banzai \nUm, also don\u2019t forget the fact that the Scandinavian countries have been pumping oil (and wealth) out of the North Sea for 30 years now. Norway, especially, is just unbelievably rich from North Sea oil. \nSocialism is real easy to manage when you are pumping stuff out of the ground for $10 and selling it for $100. The monumental bureaucratic waste kind of gets lost in the shuffle of endless free money. John \nSome good comments that ring true, Brunot. NO NATION is greater than the productivity of its citizens. No nation is more moral that the morality of its people.

                              "text": "In such a short piece, discussions of cost are almost always missing, but they were missing as well in the competing WSJ article. The CBS story says that the study \u201clooked\u201d at eight women. But this is an incomplete description. The study involved\u00a0125,426 samples from which abnormal results (typically indicating a chromosomal disorder in the fetus) were detected in\u00a03757 (3%). Ten cancers were subsequently identified in women whose babies were found to be normal despite an abnormal test result, with further analysis done on the eight women mentioned in the story. Without this\u00a0quantitative data, readers have no sense of the rarity of the eight cases described or of the scope of the benefit that might be realized if such testing were offered more widely. Unlike the WSJ article, there was not even a hint that widespread use of these tests might pose harms as well as benefits, as well as higher costs and ethical dilemmas. The story focuses on the serious impact of the test on a woman\u2019s life and on her ability to \u201cbe there\u201d for her child as she battles her cancer. In the sense that this story was more about the potential life-saving aspect of the study for women with hidden cancers, it provides useful information. But so much copy spent on telling the woman\u2019s story meant less space to provide all-important context. Nothing on the study\u2019s strengths or limitations or what the research means more broadly. For example:\u00a0 Non-invasive prenatal testing is a new kind of screening test that is sometimes offered to women over 35 or at risk for a child with Down syndrome. About 3% of women screened have an abnormal result suggesting a fetal abnormality. This was the first large-scale study to confirm that in a small number of such cases, the abnormal test result is caused instead by an undiagnosed cancer in the mother. The story focuses on an individual woman\u2019s story, and provides no perspective on the rarity of her case. Although it may be an underestimate, cancer was reported in only\u00a00.008% of the samples analyzed. The story needed some acknowledgment that this is an exceedingly rare occurrence. The story noted that the study was funded by the manufacturer of the test and that the study author quoted has a relationship with the company. That\u2019s useful context, but we require an independent voice to meet our standard on this criterion. No one was quoted except one of the study\u2019s authors. No alternatives to the blood tests were mentioned in any context. The WSJ story, by contrast, notes that the blood tests are now used in place of more invasive amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling to identify fetuses at risk. The WSJ also underscores the importance of having a positive blood test confirmed with one of these more invasive tests. Not undergoing testing at all might also be an option, but the story does not address this. Although the availability of these new tests is not specifically addressed, the story does note that \u201cprenatal testing is widely used for pregnant women at risk of having babies with chromosome disorders\u201d \u2014 implying that the new tests are one such option. We\u2019ll award a Satisfactory on that basis. The story could also have noted that the new test are recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology for some women. Usually they are offered for women over 35 or with other risk factors for a fetus with Down syndrome or certain other chromosomal abnormalities. The story establishes what is new here and made reference to the research done at Tufts and reported in JAMA. The story may have been suggested by a release, but clearly focused almost entirely on interviews with a mother and the principal investigator.",

                              "text": "The story makes no mention of costs. These treatments can be costly and may not be covered by insurance. A 30-pill box of AndroGel costs $295 on Drugstore.com. If, as the story states, \u201ctestosterone use is very widespread but it\u2019s misused a lot,\u201d cost certainly seems to be an important issue to address. As with the harms, none of the benefits of testosterone are actually quantified. The story did not, by any means, hype testosterone products as a cure all, and, as noted above, spent considerable time explaining the complexities of sexual health. That said, the framing of the story was about what happens when testosterone levels drop, and this leads readers to think that more testosterone must be better. For example, in noting that there are currently no approved testosterone products for women, instead of saying that no company has been able to make a case through clinical trials that testosterone supplements in women would have any positive effect, the story says, \u201cTo fill the void, doctors sometimes resort to prescribing off-label treatments for women, such as low doses of the gels approved for men, says Sheryl Kingsberg, a clinical psychologist and chief of obstetrics/gynecology behavioral medicine at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland.\u201d The assumption here is that \u201cthe void\u201d has been created by a slow or ineffective FDA and that women definitely need testosterone supplementation. If that is truly the case, the story should have provided some clear numbers to back that up. And there\u2019s no information given on how many men benefit \u2013 and to what level of benefit \u2013 from any of the products mentioned. The story starts to strike a bit of a cautionary tone. The very first quote in the story says, \u201cTestosterone use is very widespread, but it\u2019s misused a lot.\u201d That\u2019s Dr. Glenn Braunstein, an endocrinologist and chairman of the department of medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The story goes on to say, \u201cInaccurate diagnoses can result simply because blood draws were done at the wrong time of day. In men, testosterone levels peak in the morning and dip in the afternoon, so if doctors rely on a single blood test done in the afternoon, they may misdiagnose the source of the problem, Braunstein says.\u201d That\u2019s great information. But the story never described the potential harms from testosterone replacement. Skin rash, acne, prostate enlargement and headache are just a few of the more common side effects. The story makes several claims about the effectiveness of testosterone replacement that are unreferenced and not supported by the larger body of medical evidence. In 2004, the National Academy of Science concluded, \u201c\u2026no beneficial effects of administering testosterone have been well established.\u201d Although the story does provide the reader with a bit of information on the complexities of sexual health and low libido, it treats declining testosterone levels in both men and women as something that needs to be treated. For example, the story notes, \u201cMen\u2019s testosterone levels decrease by about 1% per year and then drop faster as they approach older age.\u201d At this point we don\u2019t know if this is bad but it certainly cannot be good. In the very next line, we are provided with the answer. Not only is it not good but there is a treatment, \u201cTestosterone treatment for men and women can help restore the hormone to a level that will push the sexual accelerator.\u201d Indeed, even in the first sentence, the story is framed as the \u201cdizzying\u201d conspiratorial assault on sexual desire in midlife. Let\u2019s face it: we are all likely to grow older and with age comes a host of age related changes. Levels of testosterone do decline as we age and testosterone is an important hormone in both men and women. But unlike low estrogen levels in women, the impact of falling testosterone in men is really not clearly defined. Although reduction in bone density, decreased libido, type 2 diabetes, changes in muscle mass and strength have all been associated with testosterone deficiency, replacement of the hormone has not demonstrated any consistent results. The Institute of Medicine in a published report from 2004 concluded, \u201c\u2026no beneficial effects of administering testosterone have been well established.\u201d A story that focuses on libido only, provides no supporting evidence and suggests that testosterone replacement works in everyone is simply wrong. In one sense, the story makes good use of experts who give readers the broad scope of sexual health and don\u2019t allow the story to become too narrowly focused on any one type of therapy. Typical of the comments is this one from Sheryl Kingsberg, a clinical psychologist and chief of obstetrics/gynecology behavioral medicine at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important for post-menopausal women to know that the quality of a relationship has been shown to be a much better predictor of sexual health and sexual satisfaction than age and menopausal status.\u201d But we were troubled by the fact that both experts quoted have done work for some of the companies that make these testosterone products, either taking grants directly or working on advisory boards. Both recently particiapted in a progam sponsored by a maker of a testosterone gel that was geared toward the investment community. We think that is always context that readers deserve to have. The story does not make any head-to-head comparisons, which we would have liked to see. But the story at least briefly mentioned:\u00a0 \u201cKingsberg emphasizes that other factors \u2014 such as exercise, fatigue, sleep deprivation, stress, cardiovascular disease and obesity \u2014 cannot be overlooked when trying to restore, or maintain, sex drive. \u201cAll of those things absolutely affect overall health and sexual health,\u201d she says.\u201d So we\u2019ll give it a barely satisfactory grade on this criterion. The story does not make any claims for the novelty of testosterone products, and so we are rating this one not applicable. The story does not rely on any news release.",

                              "text": "\"A Democrat credited the Republican governor for highlighting maternal mortality and then made a claim about Texas leading nationally\u00a0in a disturbing\u00a0way. Houston Rep. Shawn Thierry noted in a press release\u00a0circulated the day after Gov. Greg Abbott set the agenda for the special legislative session starting July 18, 2017, that Abbott authorized maternal mortality as a potential topic after Thierry and Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, had urged him to do so. Thierry said: \"\"It was clear that a special session was going to happen and we now know that our Texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation. This time around, we cannot afford for party politics to stand in the way of resolving this crisis.\"\" Abbott included \"\"extending maternal mortality task force\"\" in his session \"\"call,\"\" he said, to allow lawmakers to maintain the state\u2019s advisory Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force into 2023. The group, created by the 2013 Legislature, is otherwise abolished as of September 2019. We wondered if Texas mothers are more often dying in connection with childbirth than mothers in other states. That\u2019s been reported previously, including in a June 4, 2017, Associated Press news story stating researchers last year found the Texas rate \"\"not only the highest in the U.S., but one of the highest in the developed world.\"\" To our inquiry, a Thierry aide, Jasmine Connor, emailed us a web link to an August 2016 news story in the Guardian newspaper stating that according to a study in the medical journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, Texas in 2014 had the developed world\u2019s highest maternal mortality rate at 35.8 deaths per 100,000 births. The journal is the official publication of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \u00a0which describes itself as a 58,000-member organization dedicated to the advancement of women\u2019s health. 2016 study When we inquired, an ACOG spokeswoman, Megan Christin, emailed us a copy of the study, which appeared in the journal\u2019s September 2016 issue under the headline: \"\"Recent Increases in the U.S. Maternal Mortality Rate: Disentangling Trends From Measurement Issues,\"\" A methodological wrinkle was necessary, the authors wrote, to make sure the mortality rates estimated for each state reflected needed improvements in measurement. That is, the study adjusted each state\u2019s tally of maternal deaths to account for whether the state\u2019s death certificate already included a revealing question devised nationally in 2003 based on providing checkboxes on death certificates to measure whether women had been pregnant at up to a year before death. Adding the question, the study says, drove up reported maternal mortality rates. \"\"The addition of this question led to increases in reported maternal mortality rates,\"\" the study says. \"\"However, delays in states\u2019 adoption of the new pregnancy question together with use of nonstandard pregnancy questions created a situation where, in any given data year, some states were using the U.S. standard question, others were using questions incompatible with the U.S. standard, and still others had no pregnancy question on their death certificates.\"\" Broadly, the study relied on a definition of maternal mortality typically used for international maternal mortality comparisons. The definition, attributed to the World Health Organization: \"\"The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.\"\" The study says, though, the WHO also defines late maternal deaths: \"\"The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than 1 year after termination of pregnancy.\"\" Study: Texas saw a spike So, did Texas have the nation\u2019s highest maternal mortality? The state had a yet-to-be explained spike in rates in 2011-12, the study says, giving it by far the highest rate in the country. Previously, adjusted maternal mortality rates for Texas showed a modest increase from 2000 to 2010, the study says, from a rate of 17.7 per 100,000 live-births to 18.6. \"\"However, after 2010, the reported maternal mortality rate for Texas doubled within a 2-year period to levels not seen in other U.S. states,\"\" the report says. A figure in the study shows the Texas rate reaching 35.8 deaths per 100,000 live-births by 2014. ADJUSTED MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE, TEXAS, 2000-2014            SOURCE: Figure 4 in study, \"\"Recent Increases in the U.S. Maternal Mortality Rate: Disentangling Trends From Measurement Issues,\"\" Obstetrics & Gynecology, September 2016 The report also calls the two-year doubling for Texas through 2011-12 \"\"puzzling.\"\" The authors continue: \"\"Texas cause-of-death data, as with data for most states, are coded at the National Center for Health Statistics, and this doubling in the rate was not found for other states. Communications with vital statistics personnel in Texas and at the National Center for Health Statistics did not identify any data processing or coding changes that would account for this rapid increase.\"\" The report continues: \"\"There were some changes in the provision of women\u2019s health services in Texas from 2011 to 2015, including the closing of several women\u2019s health clinics. Still, in the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, the doubling of a mortality rate within a 2-year period in a state with almost 400,000 annual births seems unlikely. A future study \u00a0will examine Texas data by race-ethnicity and detailed causes of death to better understand this unusual finding.\"\" Among 48 other states, the estimated mortality rate in 2000 was 18.8; the rate escalated slowly to 23.8 in 2014, the report says. The remaining state, California, saw \"\"a marked decline in maternal and late maternal mortality from 2003 to 2014,\"\" the study says, going on: \"\"California has made concerted efforts to reduce maternal mortality, including initiating a statewide pregnancy-associated mortality review in 2006 and contracting with the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative to investigate primary causes of maternal death. This collaborative developed and promulgated evidence-based tool kits to address two of the most common, preventable contributors to maternal death (obstetric hemorrhage and preeclampsia) and implemented quality improvement initiatives throughout the state. These efforts appear to have helped reduce maternal mortality in California,\"\" the study says. Texas expert We were unable to connect with authors of the study including lead analyst Marian F. MacDorman of the Maryland Population Research Center at the University of Maryland, College Park. Meantime, Christin put us in touch with Dr. Lisa Hollier, ACOG\u2019s president-elect and the chair of the 15-person Texas task force focused on maternal mortality. Hollier, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, said by phone the 2012 Texas spike identified in the study was unusual, even strange. In 2014, Hollier said, the task force began a case-by-case review of the 2012 deaths, she said, because that was then the latest year of complete death data. We asked Hollier if the 2012 spike seems to hold up. Hollier said: \"\"We need a tiny bit more time to give a perfect answer to that,\"\" with conclusions possibly announced later in 2017. Asked to assess Thierry\u2019s claim about Texas leading the nation in deaths in childbirth, which arguably would overlook deaths in the months after delivery, Hollier said by email: \"\"As I considered this question, I believe that the proportion of all maternal deaths that occur literally \u2018in childbirth\u2019 would be largely equivalent across states. Given the high rates of maternal mortality in Texas relative to other states, I believe this would mean that deaths \u2018in childbirth\u2019 would \u00a0also be high in Texas relative to other states.\"\" State agency response We also wondered if Texas government officials had analyzed the research suggesting Texas lately has the nation\u2019s highest maternal mortality rate. At the Texas Department of State Health Services, spokesman Chris Van Deusen replied to our query by email by saying the agency doesn\u2019t have data for other states or do related rankings. Van Deusen otherwise confirmed that officials are looking into what appears to have been a \"\"pronounced difference\"\" in Texas women in 2012 dying in childbirth or within a year afterward. Van Deusen said that to date, the task force had found the most common causes of maternal death in 2011-2012 were cardiac events (21 percent), drug overdoses (12 percent) and hypertension/eclampsia (11 percent). The task force\u2019s July 2016 report states: \"\"Cardiac events and hypertension/eclampsia were ranked first and third most common causes of maternal death, which is consistent with medical literature. However, overdose by ingestion of drugs emerged as the second leading cause of maternal death in 2011-2012 (11.6 percent). Review of actual case records (including postmortem toxicology and police reports) showed that the majority of these maternal deaths involved licit or illicit prescription opioids. This finding is alarming and may represent an ongoing shift in maternal causes of death.\"\" Also of concern, the task force said, was the number of maternal deaths that occurred months after delivery. Close to 60 percent of Texas maternal deaths 2011-2012 \"\"occurred after 42 days post-delivery,\"\" the task force wrote. \"\"Case review of these deaths will determine whether they were pregnancy-related, -associated, or neither. Nevertheless, it is clear that women remain at-risk for the first year after their pregnancy has ended. It is possible that lack of continuity of care plays a role in these later maternal death outcomes.\"\" In June 2017, Van Deusen wrote us: \"\"Maternal deaths have been increasing in Texas at the same time we have seen increases in the chronic diseases that underlie many deaths: from 2005 to 2014, pre-pregnancy obesity of mothers increased 25 percent, hypertension increased 20 percent, and diabetes increased 45 percent.\"\" The state official also provided a chart suggesting that in 2014, 126 or 135 maternal deaths were reported in Texas, giving the state a rate of 31.5 or 33.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live-births, according to respective counts by DSHS and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with both rates a decrease from 2013 and the CDC-reported rate down 13 percent from the 38.7 deaths per 100,000 live-births posted for 2012: Texas Maternal Deaths Within 42 days After The End of Pregnancy DSHS Data CDC Wonder Data Maternal deaths Live Births Maternal Mortality Rate Maternal deaths Live Births Maternal Mortality Rate 2010 72 385,746 18.7 72 386,118 18.6 2011 100 377,274 26.5 114 377,445 30.2 2012 110 382,438 28.8 148 382,727 38.7 2013 126 387,110 32.5 140 387,340 36.1 2014 126 399,482 31.5 135 399,766 33.8 SOURCE: Emails, Chris Van Deusen, director of media services, Texas Department of State Health Services, June 8-9, 2017 Limited federal data At Hollier\u2019s suggestion, we also checked on whether the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports state-by-state maternal mortality rates. Our web search yielded the center\u2019s 2017 assessment that the national rate reached a high of 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2009 and 2011, according to the center\u2019s review of state-forwarded death certificates for women who died within a year of delivering. CDC says: \"\"Whether the actual risk of a woman dying from pregnancy-related causes has increased is unclear. Many studies show that an increasing number of pregnant women in the United States have chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic heart disease. These conditions may put a pregnant woman at higher risk of pregnancy complications. Although the overall risk of dying from pregnancy complications is low, some women are at a higher risk than others. The higher pregnancy-related mortality ratios during 2009\u20132011 are due to an increase in infection and sepsis deaths.\"\" SOURCE: Web page, \"\"Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System,\"\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, last updated May 10, 2017 (accessed May 26, 2017) At our request, Kimberly Rodriguez of the CDC emailed charts based on agency data showing that in 2015 among only 15 states with reported maternal death rates, Texas tied with Missouri for the third-highest rate of deaths per 100,000 residents, behind Louisiana, Georgia and Indiana. That\u2019s a different indicator, though, than deaths per 100,000 live-births. In the end, CDC spokesman Brian Tsai suggested by email that we rely on the older figures covered by the 2016 study we'd already reviewed. Our ruling Thierry said Texas mothers \"\"are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation.\"\" In 2011 and 2012, according to a 2016 study, Texas had by far the nation\u2019s highest maternal mortality rate. A clarification missing from Thierry\u2019s statement: That national analysis took into account deaths not just at childbirth but during pregnancy and up to 42 days after delivery. \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\"",

                              "text": "The new medical cannabis dispensaries in Texas have persevered despite high state licensing fees, a rigid regulatory environment and prospects for a severely restricted customer base.  But just as they\u2019re harvesting their first crops and working to bring initial medications to market, another hurdle is on the horizon \u2014 in the form of a pharmaceutical company\u2019s experimental drug that\u2019s derived from the same non-psychoactive marijuana extract the Texas dispensaries are producing and is targeted at some of the same patients.  The drug, called Epidiolex and manufactured by London-based GW Pharmaceuticals, could win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as soon as this summer and by the fall could be available for sale nationwide, including in Texas. If so, it would be the first prescription drug derived from marijuana to get the green light from the FDA, and industry experts say it likely would be covered by medical insurance.  Epidiolex is comprised of purified cannabidiol \u2014 a cannabis extract that doesn\u2019t make people high \u2014 and it is intended as a treatment for patients with certain rare forms of epilepsy.  The three medical cannabis dispensaries licensed in Texas \u2014 Compassionate Cultivation, Cansortium Texas and Surterra Texas \u2014 also are producing cannabidiol, known as CBD, as their primary extract. They are only allowed by state law to sell it to patients suffering from rare forms of epilepsy and under a doctor\u2019s direction.  The upshot is the potential for strong competition for the Texas dispensaries just as they\u2019re gaining their footing, even as advocates for medical marijuana say a stamp of approval from the FDA for Epidiolex this summer would be a landmark for establishing broad credibility for the therapeutic properties of CBD.  \u201cIf (the Texas dispensaries) can\u2019t establish clear lines of delineation, or some other value proposition, then we do think it is going to be difficult for them to compete\u201d if Epidiolex wins FDA approval and is marketed in Texas, said John Kagia, executive vice president for industry analytics at New Frontier Data, a cannabis market research firm based in Washington.  \u201cAn FDA-approved, commercially available CBD product will present acute competition in a CBD-only (cannabis) market\u201d such as the one in Texas, Kagia said.  Compassionate Cultivation and Surterra Texas are in the Austin metro area, while Cansortium Texas is in Schulenburg. Similar to cannabis-derived products sold by dispensaries in other states that have legalized various forms of medical marijuana, their products haven\u2019t gone through the years-long FDA approval process and aren\u2019t covered by medical insurance.  Epidiolex is expected to be expensive \u2014 Cowen analyst Phil Nadeau estimates it will cost $2,500 a month in the U.S. \u2014 but medical experts say the likelihood of insurance coverage would blunt the hit to patients.  Scott Perry, a Fort Worth pediatric neurologist, said many Texas doctors probably would opt for an FDA-approved CBD drug over similar treatments if they have a choice. Perry participated in some of GW Pharmaceuticals\u2019 drug trials for Epidiolex and also helped advocate for passage of the Texas medical cannabis law, called the Compassionate Use Act, in 2015.  If Epidiolex wins FDA approval, \u201cI suspect more doctors will feel comfortable prescribing it\u201d than steering their patients to other CBD treatments that haven\u2019t been put through the agency\u2019s rigorous processes, Perry said.  Still, the Texas dispensaries aren\u2019t necessarily blanching at the potential challenge. Morris Denton, chief executive of Compassionate Cultivation, acknowledged Epidiolex could cost his dispensary some customers, but he said he considers \u201cthe glass three-quarters full\u201d if the drug wins FDA approval because of the overall credibility CBD would gain as a result.  Epidiolex \u201crepresents a competitor,\u201d Denton said, but he said he doesn\u2019t \u201cview it with trepidation.\u201d  \u201cI view Epidiolex and other clinical trials that are based around (cannabis extracts) as great validators for the potential of this medicine,\u201d he said.  He and others said an FDA determination that CBD has medical value \u2014 even though such a ruling by the agency this summer would be limited solely to CBD in the form of Epidiolex \u2014 could be useful in efforts to convince Texas lawmakers during next year\u2019s legislative session to expand access to medical cannabis in the state from what currently is highly restricted availability only for certain epilepsy sufferers.  Dozens of patients and caregivers from around Texas traveled to the Capitol during the 2017 legislative session to advocate for more access to medical marijuana, but bills that would have substantially expanded on the Compassionate Use Act \u2014 to add conditions such as autism, for instance \u2014 were unsuccessful.  Epidiolex \u201ccould potentially disrupt the existing market (in Texas), but I would think it also would probably make it practical for lawmakers in Texas to expand the definition of allowable CBD product offerings\u201d from the new dispensaries, said Matthew Karnes, founder of GreenWave Advisors, a cannabis industry research firm based in New York. \u201cI would think that in Texas it would likely be a catalyst\u201d to lift some prohibitions on who can buy CBD products from the dispensaries.  In the interim, however, the state\u2019s dispensaries already have a larger potential Texas customer base than Epidiolex does, Denton said, because they\u2019re allowed to sell to patients with any form of so-called intractable epilepsy, defined by the state law as people for whom two mainstream seizure drugs have proved ineffective. Initially, GW Pharmaceuticals is seeking FDA approval for Epidiolex as a treatment only for two specific forms of intractable epilepsy \u2014 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome \u2014 although the company is testing it in others.  Products from the Texas dispensaries also might remain appealing for certain epilepsy patients who want treatments that incorporate a fuller spectrum of cannabis extracts and not just CBD, observers said. Some proponents of medical marijuana consider other components of the plant to have medicinal qualities as well.  While Epidiolex is essentially pure CBD, products made by the Texas dispensaries can contain additional plant extracts \u2014 as long as they don\u2019t exceed 0.5 percent tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is the chemical in conventional marijuana that produces a high. For comparison, marijuana for recreational purposes generally contains from 9 percent to more than 30 percent THC.  A number of products that advertise CBD oil as ingredients can be bought in Texas without prescriptions, but they are produced by out-of-state companies and contain only trace levels of THC, generally considered to be 0.3 percent or less. In addition, an academic study in 2015 found that medical marijuana products made in some states often didn\u2019t contain the amount of ingredients claimed on their labels.",

That high hope seemed to rise from this headline: \"\"Cannabis May Stop Coronavirus From Infecting People, Study Finds.\"\" The headline appeared on an article on MerryJane.com that was widely shared on Facebook. But readers should not get too excited. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The website updated its headline with more accurate information following the publication of this fact-check. A preliminary study supported researchers\u2019 theory that certain cannabis extracts could be used as part of a treatment to prevent coronavirus infections. But the study has not been peer reviewed and no testing has yet been done on humans. \"\"Yes, this is an overstatement,\"\" Igor Kovalchuk, the lead researcher of the study, told PolitiFact about the headline. Cannabis and marijuana are not exactly the same. Cannabis refers to all products derived from the plant Cannabis sativa. The cannabis plant contains about 540 chemical substances. Marijuana refers to parts of, or products from, the plant Cannabis sativa that contain substantial amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the substance that\u2019s primarily responsible for the effects of marijuana on a person\u2019s mental state. The website that published the article is part of Los Angeles-based Merry Jane, which describes itself as a \"\"multi-media and lifestyle company that\u2019s creating the new mainstream culture by connecting cannabis and pop culture.\"\" The article, however, is more nuanced than its headline. The article says that based on the study, \"\"cannabis extracts could work as an \u2018adjunct therapy\u2019 in new medical products that could reduce the chances of someone getting COVID-19.\"\" In other words, despite the headline on the article, the study isn\u2019t saying cannabis alone could prevent infection. The study referred to in the article was done by six researchers from universities of Lethbridge and Calgary, both in Canada. The researchers are also affiliated with two startup companies that do medical cannabis and disease research. Their study was published April 19 in Preprints, which describes itself as a platform for \"\"early versions of research outputs\"\" that are not peer-reviewed. So, this is a preliminary research paper. According to the study, all cannabis plants for the study were grown in a licensed facility at the University of Lethbridge to obtain the extracts, which were then applied to artificial human 3D tissue models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues. \"\"Application was intended to model medical delivery, such as local mouthwash applications, encapsulated extracts and dosed oils, and inhalers or nebulizers, and therefore these results cannot be extrapolated to the effects of cannabis smoking,\"\" the study said. The extracts, \"\"pending further investigation, may become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy,\"\" the study concluded. These extracts also \"\"can be used to develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and at-home use. Such products ought to be tested for their potential to decrease viral entry via the oral mucosa. Given the current dire and rapidly evolving epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue must be considered.\"\" In short, the researchers theorize that cannabis extracts could interfere with the virus\u2019 process of infection in cells \u2014 but this is based on laboratory testing on specially engineered tissue to fully mimic human organs, not testing on humans. \"\"Clinical trial (on humans) is a must,\"\" to determine whether extracts could help prevent COVID-19, Kovalchuk said. Virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, told PolitiFact \"\"it may be worth more study, but in my opinion this is a very long way from being a legitimate candidate for therapeutics or preventative products like mouthwash.\"\" The headline of an article shared on Facebook said: \"\"Cannabis may stop coronavirus from infecting people, study finds.\"\" The study found, based on lab testing, that cannabis extracts could be part of a treatment that dramatically reduces the chances of being infected by COVID-10. But the study is preliminary, has not been peer reviewed and tests on humans would need to be done to determine if the extracts could be part of a treatment that blocks the coronavirus, the study\u2019s lead author said. The headline contains only an element of truth. Clarification, May 28, 2020: The study found cannabis\u00a0extracts should be investigated\u00a0as an adjuct treatment for COVID-19 in addition to its use\u00a0in possible preventative products like mouthwash. This story has been updated to better reflect that\u00a0distinction. Update, June 1, 2020: This story has been updated to reflect that MerryJane.com changed its headline following publication of this fact-check.\"",

Marijuana can be described as of of the new range of superfoods, it contains over 400 chemical compounds containing beneficial vitamins, essential oils, and acids. Experts such as Dr. William Courtney have come to call weed a 'dietary essential' Marijuana contains extremely high concentrations of cannabinoid acids which it has been discovered are essential for cell function. Cannabinoid Acids The two main cannabinoid acids that have been studies so far are THCa and CBDa. If these acids are heated, through smoking, vaping, or cooking cannabis then they begin to break down into different chemicals, they become degraded into psychoactive THC and cannabinoid CBD . This process is called decarboxylation, or \u201cdecarbing.\u201d and it describes breaking down the acids into the form in which they become active. While active THC and CBD have their own health benefits, a downside is that the human body can only cope with a certain amount of these activated cannabinoids. Dr. Courtney explains : \u201cWe have a series of cannabis strains called ACDC. \u2018AC\u2019 stands for alternative cannabinoid, which is the CBD acid molecule, which has come into focus lately as being very important as an anti-inflammatory. \u201cAnd \u2018DC\u2019 stands for dietary cannabis. [\u2026] If you do heat it, then your dose is around 10mg. And if you don\u2019t heat it, if it\u2019s raw, then your dose is around one to 1-2,000mg.\u201d When eaten raw, the body is able to process much larger amounts of THCa and CBDa, and it can then convert these acids into essential nutrients through its metabolism. Cannabinoid acids have been linked to the prevention of chronic diseases. Endocannabinoid deficiencies thought to be linked to illnesses such as: Migraine Glaucoma Fibromyalgia Dr. Courtney has suggested that large doses of raw CBDa and THCa are much more effective in their raw form to the effect of: Anti-inflammatory properties Anti-ischemic properties (restricted blood flow in the body) Amino Acids Cannabis contains a large amount of essential amino acids, like other essential fatty acids our bodies don't produce essential amino acids of their own accord, so we need to introduce them through our diet. Amino acids are essential in that they help cells to function properly, to repair damaged tissue, to maintain structure and to transport nutrients around the body. Marijuana as a Nutritional Powerhouse Antioxidant In 2003, CBD was patented by the US. government after discovering the cannabinoid had amazing antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. These antioxidants are beneficial in preventing cell damage, thus reducing illness and disease. In the research leading up to the patent, the found that CBD was a more powerful antioxidant than both vitamins C and E. As you can take in large quantities of CBD via raw cannabis, you can introduce a vast amount of antioxidants to your body very easily. Dr. Courntney has suggested consuming raw via juicing or blending, making a marijuana smoothing with other vegetables such as parsley or cilantro. Here are some other recipes to try if you want to enjoy the benefits of raw cannabis: Reference: http://organicandhealthy.org Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.

Smokers seem less likely than non-smokers to fall ill with coronavirus \u2014 Nicotine may play an indirect role that makes it harder for the virus to gain to access cells https://t.co/Psx0uMjy6g \u2014 Alfons L\u00f3pez Tena (@alfonslopeztena) May 4, 2020 After all, we know smoking is bad for our health. It\u2019s a leading risk factor for heart disease, lung disease and many cancers. Smoking also reduces our immunity, and makes us more susceptible to respiratory infections including pneumonia. And smokers touch their mouth and face more, a risk for COVID-19 infection. Initial observational findings suggested a history of smoking increased the risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients, as the World Health Organisation and other bodies have identified. But a recent paper which examined smoking rates among COVID-19 patients in a French hospital hypothesised smoking might make people less susceptible to COVID-19 infection. So what can we make of this? What the study did This study was a cross-sectional survey where the researchers assessed the exposure (smoking) and the outcome (COVID-19) at the same time. This type of research design can\u2019t prove the exposure causes the outcome \u2013 only that there may be an association. There were two groups included in the study \u2013 343 inpatients treated for COVID-19 from February 28 to March 30, and 139 outpatients treated from March 23 to April 9. Among other data collected, participants were asked whether they were current smokers. The researchers compared smoking rates in both groups with smoking rates in the general French population. The results The study found 4.4% of inpatients and 5.3% of outpatients with COVID-19 were smokers, after adjusting for differences in age and sex. This was only a fraction of the prevalence seen in the general French population. Some 25.4% reportedly smoked daily in 2018. The authors asserted: current smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population. The finding of lower rates of smokers among COVID-19 cases has been more recently described elsewhere, in a rapid review of 28 studies on smoking in COVID-19 patients from various countries. The authors of the French study suggest the mechanism behind the protective effects of smoking could be found in nicotine. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, gains entry into human cells by latching onto protein receptors called ACE2, which are found on certain cells\u2019 surfaces. The researchers have proposed nicotine attaches to the ACE2 receptors, thereby preventing the virus from attaching and potentially reducing the amount of virus that can get into a person\u2019s lung cells. The researchers are now planning to test their hypothesis in a randomised trial involving nicotine patches; though the trial is still awaiting approval from French health authorities. So how should we interpret the results? These counterintuitive results may be due to several biases, so let\u2019s explore some alternative explanations. First is what we call \u201cselection bias\u201d. The hospital patients may be less likely to be daily smokers than the general population. For example, health-care workers and those with existing chronic conditions were disproportionately represented in the inpatient sample \u2013 both of these groups usually show lower prevalence of current smoking. Further, around 60% of the hospitalised patients in the study were ex-smokers (similar to the national prevalence). Some may have given up smoking very recently in response to the WHO declaring smoking as a risk factor for COVID-19. But they were classified as non-daily smokers in the study.  Shutterstock  Second is what we call \u201csocial desirability bias\u201d. COVID-19 patients may be more likely to deny smoking when asked about their smoking status in hospital, wanting to be seen by medical professionals as doing the right thing. And data collection may have been incomplete for behavioural questions in busy hospitals overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases. Finally, it\u2019s important to note this paper has not yet been peer-reviewed. Taken together, although there appears to be an association between smoking and COVID-19 in these hospital-based samples, there\u2019s no evidence of a causal relationship \u2013 that is, that smoking prevents COVID-19. Lots of research at pandemic speed We must acknowledge this research has been conducted at \u201cpandemic speed\u201d, much faster than usual research time frames. Normally it would be months between submission and publication \u2013 but in this case the researchers completed their observations and had the research published online within the same month. An unintended consequence of the early release of research is that it may provoke undue community hope or belief in unproven treatments. French authorities had to limit sales of nicotine treatments to avoid stockpiling after this study was published. We saw a similar phenomenon recently with the drug hydroxychloroquine, where supplies ran out for those who needed them after politicians proclaimed it as a cure for COVID-19. So right now we need to put in extra effort to make sure early evidence is not misinterpreted or overstated. As for the role of smoking in COVID-19 \u2013 this link requires substantially more research and critical appraisal. Because overall, smoking still kills. \u2013 Adrian Bauman, Melody Ding and Leah Shepherd Blind peer review On the whole, this Research Check represents a fair and balanced account of the study. The alternative explanations for the observation of low smoking status prevalence among the French hospital sample provided are possible. One plausible explanation is error in recording smoking status. There is evidence of under-reporting and inaccurate reporting of smoking status within hospital samples, in general. It\u2019s unclear from the study what method was used to collect smoking status data. The authors simply state patients were \u201casked\u201d and \u201cdata were collected in the context of care\u201d. It\u2019s important to know who asked the smoking status questions, what questions were asked, when they were asked, and what record keeping system was used. Given clinical smoking status record keeping may not capture all smokers accurately, a better comparison would be to compare the 2020 data with pre-COVID-19 hospital patient data, rather than general population data which may have asked different questions. \u2013 Billie Bonevski Research Checks interrogate newly published studies and how they\u2019re reported in the media. The analysis is undertaken by one or more academics not involved with the study, and reviewed by another, to make sure it\u2019s accurate.

At PolitiFact\u2019s suggestion, MERRY JANE has revised the headline to include more information that better reflects the study\u2019s claims. A new study from Canada suggests that cannabis extracts containing THC and CBD could prevent the novel coronavirus from infecting human cells. The study , published online at Preprints, was conducted by a team of biologists licensed to grow marijuana and hemp under a Health Canada research license. Using 13 different cannabis oils extracted from newly developed strains, the team discovered that certain oils containing the cannabinoids CBD and THC could lower human cell production of two key proteins that serve as gateways for COVID-19 virus to enter the body and cause infection. Scientists believe that the novel coronavirus primarily spreads when infected individuals talk or breathe within six feet of other people. The moisture droplets that exit the infected person\u2019s mouth travel by air and are inhaled or swallowed by other people in proximity. As the virus travels into a new host\u2019s throat or sinuses (and possibly even the digestive system), it stabs its \u201ccorona\u201d spikes into a cellular protein found throughout the body called ACE2 . Another protein made by the body, TMPRSS2 , essentially turns the coronavirus spike into a chainsaw , ripping the cell open and allowing the virus to enter. Once the virus is inside of a human cell, it hijacks the cell\u2019s DNA and forces the cell to produce so many copies of the virus that the cell eventually explodes, releasing a swarm of new coronaviruses that go on to infect even more of the host\u2019s cells. Studies that predate COVID-19 suggest that cannabinoids can \u201ctune down\u201d the genes that produce, regulate, and activate both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In other words, weed oils could basically block the coronavirus from being able to infect people altogether. However, it should be stressed that the researchers are not saying that weed is a cure for the coronavirus. Rather, cannabis extracts could work as an \u201cadjunct therapy\u201d in new medical products that could reduce the chances of someone getting COVID-19. These theoretical weed-infused medicines \u201ccan be used to develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and at-home use,\u201d the Canadian researchers wrote . \u201cGiven the current dire and rapidly evolving epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue must be considered.\u201d But before you hop down to the local bar to prematurely celebrate the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, know that there are some major caveats to this study. First, the researchers didn\u2019t test weed oils in human subjects. Instead, they hit cultured human cells that produce ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with cannabis extracts. Using a bunch of biotechnology techniques, they found that the cannabis oils downregulated, or reduced the activity of, the genes that make and modulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To truly determine if cannabis extracts could stop the coronavirus from entering human cells, they would need to administer these extracts to human subjects who are intentionally (under experimental conditions) exposed to the coronavirus. If that sounds fucking insane, that\u2019s because it kind of is, but it\u2019s also a real thing : Drug companies are using a similar experimental setup to test whether potential coronavirus vaccines would actually work in people. Second, it\u2019s not entirely clear from the researchers' paper what the cannabis extracts contained besides THC and CBD. Cannabis extracts often contain hundreds if not thousands of different compounds, including other cannabinoids, terpenes , flavonoids , and polyphenols. While it\u2019s very possible that THC and CBD were responsible for downregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2, it\u2019s also possible that other chemicals in weed contributed to the study\u2019s results. Furthermore, the two most effective extracts for downregulating ACE2 were a 1:21 THC-to-CBD ratio oil and a 1:3 THC-to-CBD oil. Why those widely varying ratios both significantly reduced ACE2 activity was not explained, and could indicate that other cannabis compounds are at play. And the final caveat: Preprints is not a peer-reviewed scientific journal. It\u2019s basically an open-source database where researchers can share their findings with other scientists in the fastest, most efficient manner possible. Websites like Preprints enable researchers to bypass the lengthy process of peer-review \u2014 which can take months, if not years \u2014 relying instead on other scientists who volunteer their feedback to critique a specific study. So, no, we don\u2019t owe any apologies to retired footballer Kyle Turley , who claimed just a few weeks ago that his CBD products could cure COVID-19 . And we should still anticipate findings from other research projects in Canada and Israel that are investigating whether CBD combined with conventional medications could treat COVID-19. But, if the Preprints study turns out to be true, we could be fast approaching the finish line in our race against the coronavirus. And then, the US government is going to have a really, really difficult time justifying why it considers marijuana an illegal Schedule I drug with \u201cno accepted medical use.\u201d",

                              "text": "\"Texas-based radio show host Alex Jones admitted during a child custody hearing that he has smoked cannabis, in violation of state law. But he only smoked it once per year, he reasoned \u2014 just like law enforcement does. Locked in a custody battle over his three children with his ex-wife, the conservative media personality made the admission during testimony in Austin, Texas, on April 20. That\u2019s right, 4/20. Jones said that he tries marijuana annually to gauge its potency. He argued from the stand that he thought marijuana was too strong, a shortcoming he blamed on billionaire George Soros, a frequent scapegoat of conspiracy theorists. Why smoke cannabis annually? \"\"That\u2019s what police do,\"\" Jones said, according to the Austin American-Statesman. \"\"They smoke it once a year, too.\"\" Jones has admitted to smoking marijuana before, and notably sparked up on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast earlier this year. While marijuana is illegal in Texas, it is decriminalized in California, where Rogan\u2019s show was recorded. PolitiFact has checked claims about marijuana potency before, the gist being that cannabis is as much as 800 percent stronger now than it was four decades ago. We attempted to contact Jones through his InfoWars website to suss out the basis of his claim that cops rolled their own, but did not receive a response. Jones may have been speaking anecdotally, with or without firsthand knowledge of stoner cops. Law enforcement agencies, however, suggested that Jones was just blowing smoke. Where there\u2019s smoke In general, when people talk about marijuana\u2019s potency, they mean the levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. That\u2019s the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, which contains hundreds of chemical compounds. There\u2019s plenty of research that shows THC levels have increased over the years. A 2010 study by researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, for example, found that the THC concentrations had risen by about 171 percent in just a 16-year time period. That study used 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. But there was no indication that cops smoked the ganja to find out how strong it was. That\u2019s a job for a laboratory. There are a couple of methods for measuring the chemical compounds in cannabis, but all of them take a certain level of scientific proficiency and technical equipment. Many states that have medical or recreational marijuana have labs that test for these compounds; one company in California has even developed testers for business use outside of a lab. But it\u2019s not like you can take a few hits and spit out a THC percentage, the way Jones implied. We don\u2019t know how he concocted his theory, or which police department he believed was letting officers light up, but we checked with a few places. The Texas Department of Public Safety said they did not have any specifics about departmental drug testing, either for seized evidence or for employees. The state does operate several crime labs that test drugs seized as evidence. The Texas Police Association also did not tell us any particular procedure used by law enforcement agencies. They only said that each department in the state would have its own policies and methods. Since Jones is in Austin, we went to the local P.D. to ask them if it\u2019s possible cops spark up the local dank to get an idea of how strong the weed is there. In a word, no. Jennifer Herber, a spokeswoman for the Austin police department, pointed out that the department\u2019s policy manual prohibited marijuana use. The department does not test cannabis, she said. On a federal level, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Russ Bayer said the DEA operates its own labs to gauge potency and purity of all kinds of drugs, including marijuana. Depending on the case, the labs may test evidence from federal cases or helping local authorities. But agents toking up to give drugs a personal test? \"\"It\u2019s laughable. Not plausible,\"\" Bayer said. \"\"Frankly, it\u2019s insulting. The DEA would never allow consumption of any controlled substance.\"\" Our ruling Defending his own use of marijuana, Jones said police officers \"\"smoke it once a year, too.\"\" He didn\u2019t offer any proof of his claim that cops light up joints annually to test the strength of cannabis, and we couldn\u2019t find any. Perhaps Jones anecdotally knows or has heard of police officers who don't keep off the grass, but we didn't find a cop shop that said that was a policy. Law enforcement agencies generally test marijuana potency in a laboratory setting, and not by lighting up in the squad room (or elsewhere).\"",
