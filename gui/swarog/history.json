Without mentioning that our satire was a hyperbolic buildup on his own recent writings, Zakaria cries for government protection of his hurt feelings, making it clear that he can dish it out but can't take it. Taste your own medicine, Fareed.\"Progressives\" have trolled, ridiculed, satirized, maligned, insulted, bullied, and lied about conservatives since the inception of the Internet. But once they see the signs of oncoming traffic, they cry and run to mommy - or to the nanny state in this case - asking to make it a one-way street once again, where only they can ride their tricycles, wear funny hats, and fling poop at those whom they consider inferiors. Watch Fareed Zakaria on camera wiping his face from the poop flung at him. An open letter to Fareed Zakaria from The People's Cube ~ Dear Fareed,There have been studies showing that a foreign-born author's unique perspective can help the natives to boost their own creative thinking through the so-called \"schema violation,\" which occurs when our world is turned upside-down. You may argue that your \"otherness\" benefits and enlightens this country, with an implication that those unwilling to be enlightened by you are bigots who resent your \"otherness\" and won't have their old schema to be violated by a newcomer. Like you, I am a foreign-born author whose English is a second, or, rather, a third language; I know what it feels to be \"the other.\" I also like to help the natives to boost their creative thinking by turning their reality upside-down and sending their temporal and spatial cues off-kilter (my website, The People's Cube , is one such big schema violation). I don't resent anyone's \"otherness\" as long as they don't attempt to make me comply to theirs. In sum, I am not concerned with your ethnic or cultural \"otherness.\" It is your ideological \"otherness\" that bothers me, which makes you indistinguishable from the next run-of-the-mill, native-born \"progressive.\"Now that we got the implication of bigotry out of the way, let's get down to business.On January 2, one of our contributors posted a satirical response to your Washington Post article where you apparently gloated over the premature deaths of white males in America. Our author took your argument to its logical conclusion, adding the need to exterminate white females as well - through Jihad, rape, and sex slavery as recently seen in Europe and elsewhere. This parody wasn't meant to be taken as factual reporting, given the context of our website and especially considering the author's credentials at the top: Chedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth.On January 14, you responded to our satire in your Washington Post article titled, Bile, venom and lies: How I was trolled on the Internet , and today you started your show on CNN with a segment titled, Fareed's Take: I was the target of Internet trolling , in which you were mostly reading your earlier article from the teleprompter. Among other things you claimed that our story \"was cleverly written to provide conspiracy theorists with enough ammunition to ignore evidence\" and complained that some people took our \"reporting\" seriously and reposted it in social media with impolite comments, all of which led you to conclude that someone must create a mechanism in social media \"to distinguish between fact and falsehood.\" And since that someone can only be the government, your statement can only be understood as a vague call for the government censorship of the Internet.However, neither your article, nor the CNN segment mentioned that our grotesque fiction was based on your own controversial ideas that many Americans found insulting and grotesque. Why? Was it because such an admission would have undermined your argument that people were angry at you over nothing? And why in the world, Fareed, did you decide to bring up the term \"radicalization,\" which in today's world is mostly associated with Islam? Do you have such a tin ear - or do you really think that if you broaden the definition and talk about \"American radicalization,\" people will begin to see the two as morally equivalent? Do you think they are morally equivalent, Fareed?Fine, let's talk about radicalization.For you, sitting on the top floors of your well-protected media establishment's ivory tower, it's easy to downplay the threat of Islamic radicalization and throw the \"Islamophobia\" labels at all those little people down at the street level. The only radicalization to which your skewed radar is attuned is the faintest sound of protest from the little people, when they get fed up with your condescending elitism and begin to rebel against the \"progressive\" establishment. That's what scares you the most, doesn't it, Fareed? That's when you mouth off your grave concerns on CNN and write in WaPo about the threat of radicalization. But who is at fault that Americans no longer trust the establishment and its media? Have you considered the possibility that none of this would be happening if you and your colleagues weren't so radical yourselves, feeding the people with half-truths, distortions, propaganda, and outright lies, placing your Utopian \"progressive\" ideology above facts, smug and secure in your impenetrable media castle? Did it occur to you that you and your media establishment may be the very reason why so many people suddenly like Donald Trump, whom you so despise , and nothing you say on the subject can change their minds because no one trusts you anymore?When you talked about a study where \"simply by talking to one another, the bigoted students had become more bigoted,\" has it even occurred to you how perfectly this describes your \"progressive\" echo chamber, where tolerance towards opposing philosophical viewpoints is nonexistent? If you think that calling those who disagree with you \"bigots\" makes you an anti-bigot, let me share a little secret. There are two kinds of bigots today: the bigots and the anti-bigots, and it's hard to say which kind is worse. A good example of \"group polarization\" involving radical \"anti-bigots\" is JournoList - a highly biased group of about 400 left-wing journalists and political activists who for three years (2007-2010) participated in a private online echo chamber where they, in violation of public trust and professional ethics, conspired to coordinate media attacks on conservatives, to promote certain issues while burying others, and to influence the 2008 elections in favor of Barack Obama. To paraphrase Kolbert's study, \"Simply by talking to one another, the radical left-wing journalists had become more radical left-wing journalists.\" To use your exact quote, \"It is how radicalization happens and extremism spreads.\" Say, were you just as worried about \"group polarization\" then as you are now?Another example of such \"group polarization\" and radicalization is a knee-jerk impulse of allegedly mainstream journalists to describe anyone who doesn't lean left as \"far-right,\" as you have demonstrated in your CNN segment, or \"ultra-right-wing,\" as you have demonstrated in your segment.Isn't it a little too late to complain about America's radicalization, Fareed? Where were you during the George W. Bush years, when your fellow \"progressives\" trolled, ridiculed, and slandered the U.S. President and his supporters, with full support of the mainstream media? When there no longer was any distinction between a drug-fueled street protester and a media commentator? Did you complain when \"progressive\" satirists collectively created a false, hyperbolic reality around Bush, conservatives, Fox News, and America in general, which was then regularly disseminated as the truth around the world, translated into many languages, and contributing to the anti-American sentiment? Some of my own family members in Russia and Ukraine still honestly believe that those \"facts\" really happened. As you so eloquently stated,\" the people spreading this story were not interested in the facts; they were interested in feeding prejudice.\" Did you complain then, or did it feel too good to let go?You refer to a scientific study of Facebook users, which found that \"people mainly shared information that confirmed their prejudices, paying little attention to facts and veracity.\" That sounds reasonable. For example, even without a scientific study I know that an overwhelming majority of your fellow \"progressives\" believe that Sarah Palin has actually said \"I can see Russia from my house,\" paying little attention to the fact that it originated as an SNL skit. Did you complain about that in 2008? Were you at all concerned that Tina Fey's \"Palin\" videos might confuse voters and skew the election? Probably not; it was just satirical hyperbole, right?What if social media encourage misinformation, rumors, and lies, you ask. But did you ask the same question when misinformation, rumors, and lies were coming not from social media but from a seasoned mainstream journalist named Dan Rather - or, more recently, The Rolling Stone Magazine? Or, worse yet, from the nation's political leaders whom you support and admire? Wasn't the entire debate on and implementation of ObamaCare based on misinformation and lies? Were you alarmed when Joe Biden told a black audience that the Republicans would put them back in chains? Did you speak against radicalization when the \"hands up don't shoot\" movement, based on misinformation, rumors, and lies, and encouraged by the mainstream media, resulted in looting and the destruction of property, followed by the murders of innocent police officers?The answer to all those question is \"no.\" You have never violated the \"progressive\" schema, Fareed. You've been a loyal Party soldier, albeit a mediocre creative thinker, having traded your \"otherness\" for conformity and sacrificing your unique perspective to what you thought was \"progress.\"Examples are plenty; more can be provided upon request. Now let's talk about victimhood. You say you are the victim because you have received some hateful messages and comments. I have also received many hateful messages and comments from your fellow \"progressives\" over the years. Now what? You claim you have received a late-night phone call that woke up and threatened your young daughters. Indeed, Fareed, making threatening calls is a crime. Did you file a police report? Did the police trace the number and find the perpetrators, who are hardly a sophisticated organization behind an impenetrable firewall? If not, I can't believe every claim that comes from a confirmed plagiarist . You may as well claim that someone kicked your three-legged puppy and it made you cry.\ufeffWhile you played the world's saddest song on the world's smallest violin, I was the one who took the real hit. Snopes.com, a \"fact-checking\" website rooting for the \"progressive\" team, has not only debunked our satire as they've done it many times in the past - this time they also made an unsourced and slanderous allegation that our site is \"known for spreading malware.\"Next, some busybody contacted one of our advertising providers, Content.ad, which then declined to pay our advertising earnings due to \"serious quality issues.\" The money we lost as a result may be small change compared to your CNN contract, but if you were penalized for your writings in the same proportional amount, I'm sure your righteous indignation would go well beyond just one article in WaPo and a five-minute segment on CNN. There is only one victim of lies, prejudice, and institutionalized bias here - and it ain't you, Fareed. But don't let this stop you from playing your upside-down game of \"victims and radicals\" while you still can. So you think your opponents are radicals? Here's a news tip: down here in the streets below you, it's the other way around: growing numbers of Americans see you and your media colleagues as radical ideological hacks. You can call them any name you want, adding ultra-, far-, uber-, and other hyphenated insults; that won't change the fact that their thinking is the norm and yours is not. Like all normal people on this planet, they don't respond well to insults. But they are also the ones who make sure you have the freedom to call them radicals. Oleg AtbashianDepartment of Visual Agitation and Unanimity 1/18/2016, 1:27 am Red Square,I must say, this morning when I heard Fareed refer to TPC as a \"minor news site\" I was terribly offended and had to be hospitalized for a number of hours. Fortunately there was no permanent brain damage or anything so I can resume spewing hate tomorrow morning. (according to my doctor) I look forward to reading your upcoming letter to the sensitive Mr. Zakaria when my health returns in the spring.CC 1/18/2016, 3:12 am Alright, so Zakaria said that it is not obvious that this is a satire page to paraphrase. Yet the Washington Post declared us as \" Arguably one of the Internet's most satirical websites \". And if THAT isn't enough maybe the author, a cheeto dressed as Che Guevara, might have been another dead give away Might have....Really this whole thing reminded me of a clip I've seen from another satirical source... Although it 'may not' be 'clear satire' if we were to use the racist plagiarist Fareed Zakaria's standards. It's not about Zakaria, and the subject matter may be different, but mechanically he did the same thing.... He can use Craptek's Safer-Space \u2122 Products . 1/18/2016, 10:43 am Kongratulations, Komrade Red Square! Your People's Truth finally penetrated Fareed the Screed's bubble of Bleeding Edge Korrect Truth! Perhaps I can be allowed to suggest to the Cubitburo that you be awarded the title, \"People's Needler\" for that penetration, and also\"Onion of the Soviet Cube\" for having made him cry like a little girl. 1/18/2016, 4:24 pm Sounds like Fareed really, really wants to be on the cover of the next issue of Poor Me. Instead of bringing back Beet of the Week (thanks to Speaker Ryan, it might well be fully funded again since he moved to fully fund pretty much everything else), perhaps we should implement something called Whiner of the Week and make Fareed the first recipient. Fareed had to read the article from a teleprompter because someone else probably wrote it. 1/18/2016, 4:49 pm Commissarka Pinkie Sounds like Fareed really, really wants to be on the cover of the next issue of Poor Me. Instead of bringing back Beet of the Week (thanks to Speaker Ryan, it might well be fully funded again since he moved to fully fund pretty much everything else), perhaps we should implement something called Whiner of the Week and make Fareed the first recipient. Thank you for reminding me! I'll get to making the second issue of Poor Me Magazine right away. Preparing Whiner of the Week award is a bit more complicated, as I foresee a lot of red tape, hurdles, signatures, bribes, and entertainment expenses before it is even included in this Five-Year Plan. In lieu of that, let me use the existing Golden Teabag award and sticker: If he was smarter, he'd just turn the other cheek.

You won't find 'em anywhere else. Only on the People's Cube, comrade! Only on the People's Cube. This clowns tears look more like that of an entirely different body fluid. Are we sure he's not a bukkake(don't google, you've been warned) enthusiast? Komrade Victor - are you implying that Fareed is \"wee-wee'd up\" (to use a phrase first uttered by The Most High and Mighty Barack H Obama)? My Our Entire Beet Kollecktiv has ( Unanimously! ) voted to send Kameradka Zakaria An Entire Pallet Of Teenage-Girl-Sized Feminine Hygiene Pads .

Commie fight! 1/19/2016, 2:52 am Fareed Zakaria shown above accepting his Proletariat Peabody Award (more commonly known as the HUA Award) from The People's Cube for \"Outstanding Heads-Up Asininity\" in Progressively projecting onto those \"others\" his own heart-felt bigotry in a manner portraying himself as victim -- i.e., as the bigotee rather than the bigotor. Next on his target list is The Onion, Mad Magazine, and other libelously parodic and satirical mockers of well-deserved mockees. Response to 3min mark: Woh! This is a satire website??? So does that mean Laika the space dog is NOT a real reporter??? I just...I just don't know what to believe anymore! 1/19/2016, 9:35 am after a single mention by Rush Limbaugh, the \"Stalinist version of the Onion\" the Peoples Cube was overwhelmed with visits and new members...Given the ratings and the audience of CNN, has there been any spike in viewers to the cube? perhaps we can get someone to stand on a corner and hand out flyers? I can go back to writing the website on the walls of the ladies room stalls... (you meet the nicest people in there)Viva la Clinton News Network!FLOORWARD! 1/19/2016, 3:14 pm Comrade Square, your written response was way beyond masterful, there is however one minor problem. The entire article will have to be reduced to a collection of single syllable words by the CNN editorial staff, so their \"on camera personalities\" may absorb some of the meaning.Concerning the proletariat award, I am sure that any resemblance to the Debby Washerwoman is purely coincidental. 1/20/2016, 12:59 am Comrade Trump has gone beyond an amusing cartoon to the party. Now the gloves must come off for this threat comrades. Books, banners, T-shirts and hats will be burned, neighbors will be shamed in the streets, and any white subversive sympathizer will be reeducated in the Eastern camps at hard labor to appreciate third world values, food and dance. Zero toleration for any leftover capitalist pigs in the USA! The comments on Fareed's article are pretty awesome... On special request from Commisarka Pinkie: Poor Me Mag #2 | See #1 here .

Never mind. I forgot that the first issue was about a gay man who was upset that he was gay and other people were not. 1/21/2016, 4:48 pm If there is a story in deaf as a Post, there could be something to this.CNN as confident [ this is mean he is a good plagiarist] that any of his text may have come from not copyrighted sources.Will he be Fareed from employment? Probably not, CNN loves originality, even if it is somebody else's. General Confusion Comrade Square, your written response was way beyond masterful , there is however one minor problem. The entire article will have to be reduced to a collection of single syllable words by the CNN editorial staff, so their \"on camera personalities\" may absorb some of the meaning.Concerning the proletariat award, I am sure that any resemblance to the Debby Washerwoman is purely coincidental. Yes! Yes! Yes! Comrade General Confusion!I just have to sit down and take it in. Awesome! So awesome! That is the finest use of English by anyone in the cube, or out including myself!There should be an appropriate award by members, you can head a committee!GC General Confusion Comrade Pamalinsky,That is the finest use of English by anyone in the cube, or out including myself!There should be an appropriate award by members, you can head a committee!GC Thanks, General Confusion, for your kind words. Thing is, I had to dry the tears dripping down my cheeks after reading it. I am so proud to be a Cubist (an art form) Poor Fareed, his skin is so thin that when the wind blows he calls it an extremist racist troll that offends him. 1/21/2016, 10:15 pm Komrade Direktor, how dare you say these hateful words of oppression towards Mr. Zakaria! I know he attacked our Glorious Kube, but he's clearly Muslim or related to Muslims (Judging by the Glorious Muslim name), which makes him a part of the Protekted Peoples of the Kubist Way. That means that you can't attack him. He is rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off of him and sticks on you. Anyways, the Kube is Eternal and Glorious, the attacks of someone like him can't damage it. Where there is Kommunism, there is the Kube, and as long as there is one person alive that is dedicated to the Eternally True Kommunist Way, then the Kube will live on. And Zakaria is actually helping the Kube, he is letting people know of it's existence, and once you have the Kube on your mind it won't go away. I thought I was immune to the Allure of the Kube since 2009 when I started reading it. That was until I decided to become a part of the Revolution and enlist in the People's Kubist Revolutionary Force.Besides, our Glorious Party Organ isn't satire, it's Eternal Current Truth! Laika lives on, she will never die! I get all my news from the Kube, it tells me what to think, since I can't actually think for myself anymore. I used to, but then I was revolutionized by the Kube. Can you say that about such satire websites as MSNBC, Fox News, or indeed CNN, the very organization that Zakaria thinks is credible and reputable? They're as credible as a man saying a stick is actually a brick! Sure, these Organs of the Enemy do tell people what to think since they can't think for themselves, and they CAN revolutionize somebody, but they all believe in \"rights\". Komrade, there is only one right I believe in, and that is the right to work for the state in glorious production! And they also believe in \"ethics\" and \"Honesty\". Well, if that were the case, why are they spreading so many lies about the Kube? And why do they think they have to ask everybody questions that can easily be answered by a simple NSA scan or FBI/DHS/DEA raid? That's what makes our and many other Party Organs so great, we can and do get right to the source WITHOUT the overhead![OFF]Were this a lecture hall, I would have given a standing ovation for the letter to Zakaria. 1/25/2016, 10:22 pm methadras Poor Fareed, his skin is so thin that when the wind blows he calls it an extremist racist troll that offends him. I tend to find the passing wind somewhat offensive. I'm not sure if it's racist though. Likely a climate denier. I'm sure of that! It denies me my comfortable climate! 4/3/2016, 11:37 pm This story is now being discussed in Sweden. I accidentally noticed a popular link leading to the Cube, and clicking on it resulted in a Swedish news portal. Google Chrome offers a more or less readable translation - the style is lost, but the content is quite good. Very well stated. Thanks for being here, Komrade.

Yeah, mi, it reminds me of the time when Robert Redford announced his retirement (first in a series) in a video, and some commenter said, and I paraphrase, \"Whew, for a minute there I thought I was watching my bulldog's ballsack.

                              "text": "\"Some chain e-mails remind us of a bad  Three's Company  episode. One roommate overhears something a little wrong and leaps to all sorts of misguided conclusions. Hijinks ensue. The  latest chain e-mail  sent to us from a reader puts some words into the mouth of former Sen. Tom Daschle that raised our eyebrows. Daschle, you may recall, was once President Barack Obama's choice to be secretary of health and human services. He stepped down from consideration amid revelations about tax problems, but some think his fingerprints can be seen in some of the health provisions in the economic stimulus package signed by the president in February. According to the e-mail (read the  full text here  ), Daschle was quoted in a Bloomberg story saying, \"\"Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them.\"\" We thought that sounded a bit impolitic, and fairly callous, for a former senator to say, and so we decided to check it out. As with most e-mail claims, it starts with a grain of something. Bloomberg did run a story about health provisions in the stimulus package on Feb. 9, 2009, under the headline  \"\"Ruin Your Health With the Obama Stimulus Plan: Betsy McCaughey.\"\" It was a commentary piece written by  Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York and an adjunct senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. McCaughey warned that the stimulus included several troublesome provisions identical to ideas outlined by Daschle in his 2008 book,  Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis. Midway through the article, McCaughey includes this paragraph: \"\"Daschle says health care reform 'will not be pain-free.' Seniors should be more accepting\u00a0of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. That means the elderly will bear the brunt.\"\" We contacted McCaughey to see which parts of this were her words and which were Daschle's. The phrase that health care reform \"\"will not be pain-free\"\" is a direct quote from Daschle, she explained. She said the sentence beginning \"\"Seniors should be more accepting\"\" was her paraphrasing of an argument in Daschle's book in which he quotes David Mechanic, a health care policy expert at Rutgers University, saying, \"\"more and more of what were once seen as social, behavioral, or normative aspects of every day life, or as a normal process of aging, are now framed in a medical context. ... Whether wrinkles, breasts, or buttocks, impotence or social anxieties, or inattention in school, they all have become grist for the medical mill.\"\" We think it's a stretch to summarize Daschle's position as saying that seniors should be more accepting\u00a0of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. Not treating wrinkles is one thing. Not treating, say, heart disease, is another. But that's fair enough for McCaughey to opine. This is labeled an opinion piece. The point is that these are McCaughey's words, not Daschle's. The last sentence, \"\"That means the elderly will bear the brunt,\"\" was her conclusion, McCaughey said. McCaughey said she is a meticulous scholar and \"\"I regret any misrepresentations made by others of my work or Mr. Daschle's views.\"\" Our efforts to reach Daschle for comment were not successful. In the chain e-mail, quote marks are shifted, clouding the issue of who is actually speaking, and the e-mail suggests that Daschle actually said that. The e-mail begins: \"\"Apparently,\u00a0seniors are expendable \u2014 treating us is not worth the expense (unless you're\u00a0a congressman!). Then later: Tom Daschle was credited today by Bloomberg with the following\u00a0statement. Bloomberg: \"\"Daschle says health-care reform will\u00a0not be pain free. Seniors should be more accepting of the\u00a0conditions that come with age  instead of treating them.\"\" The e-mail ends, urging, \"\"Please use the power of the Internet to get this message out. Talk it up at the grassroots level. We\u00a0have an election coming up in one year and nine months. We\u00a0have the ability to address and reverse the dangerous direction\u00a0the Obama administration and its allies have begun and in the\u00a0interim, we can make their lives miserable. Let\u2019s do\u00a0it!\"\" A few shifted quote marks make all the difference here. Instead of McCaughey's words, they become Daschle's. That kind of thing may have made for '70s sitcom gold, but here it just muddies the debate. We rule the claim in this e-mail .\"",

                              "text": "\"Anonymous e-mails claim that Sen. Barack Obama wants to \"\"unilaterally disarm our nation\"\" \u2014 and they say they have the video to prove it. \"\"You do not have to check Snopes to determine if this is true or  ... watch and listen to Obama's own words,\"\" warns one e-mail. \"\"Look at this ASAP \u2014 it may be pulled from the Obama Web site very soon,\"\" another e-mail states. \"\"This is shocking and reprehensible,\"\" opines a third e-mail. All the e-mails link to YouTube video that shows Barack Obama talking about his defense policies. The only problem is, Obama doesn't say in the video that he wants to disarm the United States. Rather, Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq, curtailing wasteful defense spending, and negotiating with Russia to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. He says he wants \"\"a world without nuclear weapons,\"\" but as we'll explain shortly, that statement is well within the mainstream of U.S. foreign policy thought. We went looking for the source of the video and found it fairly quickly on the Obama campaign Web site. The official version includes opening and concluding remarks in which he emphasizes he will eliminate wasteful spending and make his sole priority protecting the American people. Obama's campaign created the video while campaigning to win the Iowa caucuses. Obama was seeking the endorsement of Caucus4Priorities, an Iowa-based advocacy movement that wants a portion of defense spending diverted to domestic issues like education and jobs. The group instead endorsed John Edwards. Here's Obama's statement in its entirety. We've noted where the edited version in the chain e-mails begins and ends: \"\"Thanks so much for the Caucus4Priorities, for the great work you've been doing. As president, I will end misguided defense policies and stand with Caucus4Priorities in fighting special interests in Washington. First, I'll stop spending $9-billion a month in Iraq. [Edited video starts.] I'm the only major candidate who opposed this war from the beginning, and as president, I will end it. \"\"Second, I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems, and I will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary spending. \"\"Third, I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons. I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material, and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals. [Edited video ends.] \"\"You know where I stand. I've fought for open, ethical and accountable government my entire public life. I don't switch positions or make promises that can't be kept. I don't posture on defense policy, and I don't take money from federal lobbyists for powerful defense contractors. As president, my sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the American people. Thanks so much.\"\" We suspect that the phrase \"\"a world without nuclear weapons\"\" may have set off Obama's anonymous critics. Actually, that goal has been promoted by foreign policy experts on both sides of the political aisle. Obama's goal echoes an opinion piece published in the  Wall Street Journal  on Jan. 4, 2007, authored by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn. Its title: \"\"A World Free of Nuclear Weapons.\"\" \"\"The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete,\"\" their essay said. \"\"Deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective.\"\" The piece then goes on to argue for similar points as Obama mentions in his statement, though in more detail. The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. The piece kicked off enough discussion and debate in the foreign policy community that the quartet authored another piece for the  Wall Street Journal  a year later, titled \"\"Toward a Nuclear-Free World,\"\" in which they discussed growing support for their ideas. Not everyone agreed, of course. In May 2008, the  Weekly Standard  published a detailed critique of the policies by Gary J. Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute and Henry Sokolski of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, who argued that their proposed solutions would be difficult to implement. For our fact-checking purposes, the point here is that Obama's statement falls firmly within the mainstream of the U.S. foreign policy debate. His position does not constitute unilateral disarmament, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. \"\"He's advocating the abolition of nuclear weapons in general, not nuclear disarmament,\"\" Pike said. \"\"If you're going to disagree with him, you have to understand what you're disagreeing with.\"\" The notion of unilateral disarmament is pretty much a nonstarter for both major political parties, including Obama, he added. \"\"Outside of the religious pacifist community, that is just not a policy position that has had meaningful political support in the United States,\"\" Pike said. One of the outlets that has promoted the Obama-wants-to-disarm-us argument is the conservative blog Macsmind. Macsmind linked on Feb. 27, 2008, to a YouTube video; several of the e-mails we received linked to the Macsmind post. Macsmind posted the commentary, \"\"Sen. McCain, you should grab this video and play it on every ad you can. This is absolutely shocking reprehensible. He plans to universally disarm our nation (sic). The question is for what, and more specifically 'for whom'.\"\" On June 8, Macsmind posted a full version of the video, noting \"\"some lefties are complaining that the video is a hack job and it's out of context. Therefore I present to you context.\"\" Macsmind and others may not like the foreign policy goals that Obama outlines in his video, but it's deceptive to call those goals unilateral disarmament. For this reason, we find this the chain e-mail's statements to be .\"",

In addition, the e-mail contained multiple links to the Wikipedia entry for Social Security and line graphs of Ronald Reagan's year-by-year approval ratings.\n\nBecause Obama copied and pasted some critical passages directly from right-wing editorials and personal blogs, the e-mail included formatting irregularities that caused many citizens to receive a message in which all of the apostrophes were replaced with question marks. Moreover, some software flagged it as spam.\n\n\"I don?t mean to be rude, but I thought we were all on the samepage about helath care reform,\" the 29th paragraph of Obama's e-mail read in part. \"It was part of my platform. You all knew I was goingt o pursue it when you elected me. And just real fast, going back on what I said earlier, the economic stimulus cut taxes for 95% of Americans. It didn't raise them. It cut them. You people need to look at facts and stop litnening to all the right wing crap out there. By the way, we're basically out of Iraq now. You?re welcome.\"\n\n\"JESUS CHRIST, WE LOST OVER @ MILLION JOBS BEFOREE I EVEN TOOK OFFICE!!!11!\" reads a sentence occupying a large white space between two massive chunks of texts, one of which was a 6,500-word tangent on the Muslim community center being built two blocks from the former World Trade Center site.\n\nAccording to White House sources, Obama \"snapped\" late Tuesday afternoon when a staffer reminded him he was scheduled to take a call from incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner. At that point, a visibly disgusted Obama was observed slowly repeating the words \"House Speaker Boehner\" before ordering everyone to leave the Oval Office, where he sat typing and, according to some, banging angrily on his keyboard for the next five hours.\n\nWhen White House Chief of Staff Pete Rouse urged the president to sleep on the e-mail, Obama told him he had already sent it.\n\n\"In terms of fulfilling campaign promises I think I've actually done a pretty good job in terms of fulfilling campaign,\" Obama wrote in response to an anonymous comment made to a post by conservative blogger Michelle Malkin. \"I know I said I'd close Guantanamo and I sti5ill want to do that but it's harder than it looks. And yes I know I said it would be done by now along with energy reform too\u2014-trust me it is still a priority because \"TOGETHER WE CAN & MUST EMBRACE CLEAN ENERGY\"\"\n\n\"Yes we can!\" the e-mail concluded. \"Ugh, you know what? Forget it. Believe what you want. Yours, Barack.\"\n\nThus far the response from the American public has been subdued, though a sixth of the populace did not even receive the e-mail because the message generated 50 million mailer-daemon delivery failure notifications.",

After brushing off his staff, Biden added that both candidates are qualified, but then added,  Hillary s overwhelmingly qualified to be president. Biden s comments will be an uplift to Clinton, who suffered a public humiliation after the Vice President branded her as  new  to the issues of income inequality, a staple of the Sanders campaign.Surprisingly, Biden told Mic that he does not believe Clinton is held to a higher standard because she is a woman, even though social psychology shows people do, in fact, hold women in politics to a different   higher  standard than men.Although not an official endorsement, is Biden ready for Hillary?Here s the interview, via YouTube: Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",

The report indicates that a formal offer of the position has not been discussed yet between Biden and Clinton.Biden has years of experience with foreign policy, including time leading the Foreign Relations Committee when he was a U.S. Senator from Delaware, and he has been one of President Obama s closest advisors on the topic while serving as Vice President.Biden considered running for President this year, and some polls indicated he would have been a strong challenger to Clinton. After the death of his son Beau, he decided against the campaign and has endorsed Clinton. His speech in favor of Clinton at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia was one of the highlights of the event.He has been holding campaign events on her behalf and is among the all-star team of surrogates including the President, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Senator Bernie Sanders that are promoting Clinton s campaign.Biden has also dedicated himself to leading the so-called  moon shot  project to cure cancer, a position that President Obama announced for him during his final State of the Union address.Featured image via Flickr",

Democrats badly want to get back control of the Republican-controlled Senate in the Nov. 8 election, and are sending Obama, Michelle Obama and Joe Biden to states where close races could tip the balance. In Nevada, Obama reserved most of his firepower for mocking three-term Republican U.S. Representative Joe Heck, who had supported his party\u2019s presidential candidate until earlier this month when Donald Trump\u2019s campaign went into crisis mode by the release of a video in which he lewdly bragged about groping and kissing women. \u201cI understand Joe Heck now wishes he never said those things about Donald Trump, but they\u2019re on tape, they\u2019re on the record,\u201d Obama said, using Heck\u2019s earlier praise of Trump against him. It\u2019s not just the Senate. Obama wants to capitalize on his high approval rating to help elect more Democrats to the House of Representatives, and has also endorsed about 150 candidates in state legislative races. At an intimate fundraising dinner in La Jolla, California, on Sunday evening, where tickets started at $10,000, Obama urged about 60 guests to help elect Democratic congressional candidate Doug Applegate, a former Marine colonel who is challenging Republican incumbent Darrell Issa. \u201cAs far as I can tell, (Darrell) Issa\u2019s primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere,\u201d Obama said. Issa, the former head of the House Oversight Committee, led a series of headline-grabbing investigations into Obama\u2019s administration - but has featured a photo of Obama signing legislation on a campaign brochure. \u201cNow that is the definition of chutzpah!\u201d Obama said. Last week, Obama excoriated Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida - who has a narrow lead over Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy, a congressman - for failing to repudiate Trump. In the final two weeks leading up to Nov. 8, Clinton said she planned to work hard to support congressional and state races. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be emphasizing the importance of electing Democrats down the ballot,\u201d Clinton told reporters traveling with her on Saturday. In Las Vegas, Obama was introduced by the Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto, a two-term Nevada attorney general, who would be the first Latina elected to the U.S Senate if she wins. \u201cWe can\u2019t elect Hillary and then saddle her with a Congress that is do-nothing, won\u2019t even try to do something,\u201d Obama said. The Nevada Senate seat is the only Senate race this year that Republicans could flip to their control. The seat has long been held by Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, who is retiring. Cortez Masto currently has a slim 2.3 percentage point lead in an average of polls tracked by RealClearPolitics over Heck. Obama won Nevada in 2008 and 2012. Polls show Clinton with a 4.2 percentage point lead at 45.4 percent support to Trump\u2019s 41.3 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average. ",

Democrat Helen Tai bested Republican Wendi Thomas in the Bucks County race -- notching a 96-vote victory in a district that has previously favored Republicans, with Trump winning there by 3 percentage points in 2016 and Mitt Romney by 13 points in 2012.  It's the latest evidence of America's suburbs shifting in Democrats' favor since Trump took office.  Former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Tai in the race, and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee said Tai's campaign knocked on 40,000 doors in the district.  The wins in state legislative races are seen -- in part because the candidates are typically little-known -- as gauges of voters' enthusiasm in small slices of the country. Other races, including a state supreme court contest in Wisconsin, have also shown major movement in Democrats' favor in key states since Trump took office.  Read More",

We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. In fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled \u201c Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside \u201c\u2026 So what should the Democrats do now? If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. But what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th\u2026 If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year\u2019s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members \u2013 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group\u2019s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. So if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. Who would they choose? Let\u2019s take a look at the top five options\u2026 #1 Tim Kaine He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. #2 Joe Biden Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run \u2026 Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. But according to the vice president, the short answer is \u201cno.\u201d The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. Unfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. Biden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn\u2019t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. Biden would probably represent the \u201csafest\u201d choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. #3 Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. First of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. Secondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. Thirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be \u201canother McGovern\u201d and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. So even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. #4 Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the \u201cBernie Sanders\u201d wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. So she is definitely a possibility. But she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as \u201canother McGovern\u201d because of her far left policies. #5 Michelle Obama One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. And these days Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as \u201cthe most influential speech of the 2016 campaign\u201d in a recent MSN article entitled \u201c In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice \u201c\u2026 The speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama\u2019s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \u201cWhen you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,\u201d said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. \u201cWe know she didn\u2019t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.\u201d If I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. In the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. And if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. Submit your review",

            "body": "Three presidents -- one sitting and two former -- descend on Pennsylvania Saturday for a final-stretch midterm push that underscores the stakes of one of the nation's most closely watched Senate races.\n\nFor President Joe Biden, who will hold a rare joint appearance with former President Barack Obama in Philadelphia meant to boost the Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, Pennsylvania will amount to a political stress test in his home state, where he's traveled 20 times since taking office.\n\nFor former President Donald Trump, who rallies outside of Pittsburgh in the city of Latrobe, a win by his hand-selected candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz could prove his own enduring viability in a commonwealth he lost by a narrow margin in 2020.\n\nThe consequences extend well beyond next week's election. As Trump prepares to announce a third presidential bid, potentially in the coming weeks, Biden's aides are taking their own initial steps toward mounting a reelection campaign. For a several-hour stretch on Saturday afternoon, the dynamics of a potential 2020 rematch will be laid bare.\n\nThe moment marks a historic anomaly. Former presidents have typically only waded sparingly into daily politics, mostly avoiding direct criticism of the men occupying the office they once held. Not since Grover Cleveland in 1892 has a defeated one-term president returned to win the White House again.\n\nThe convergence of presidents in Pennsylvania, each warning of dire consequences should the opposing party prevail, reflects the altered norms Trump precipitated when he took office nearly six years ago, quickly issuing false accusations against Obama of spying and general malfeasance.\n\nBiden, who spent much of his first year in office trying to avoid saying Trump's name, is no longer so cautious. He called out \"Trump and all his Trumpies\" at a rally in California this week and identified Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as \"Trump incarnate\" during a fundraiser outside Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday. At his own rallies, Trump plays a video reel of slip-ups to cast his successor as a gaffe-prone senior citizen -- though he hasn't as frequently gone after Obama.\n\nObama, meanwhile, has issued his harshest criticism to the cast of candidates backed by Trump, many of whom deny the 2020 election results and have modeled themselves after the 45th president.\n\n\"It doesn't just work out just because somebody's been on TV. Turns out, being president or governor is about more than snappy lines and good lighting,\" Obama said in Arizona last week of the Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, a former local news anchor.\n\nObama becomes a main draw in battleground states\n\nPennsylvania's senate and gubernatorial contests are the sole marquee races of this year's midterm cycle Biden has stumped in repeatedly. In other high-profile races, candidates have maintained their distance from a president with underwater approval ratings.\n\nThat hasn't been true of Obama, who has been in high demand among Democrats in close races. In the final weeks of the campaign, Obama has held raucous rallies in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada -- all states Biden has avoided in the last several months as candidates work to stave off Republican momentum.\n\nThat's a 180-degree turn from midterm cycles during Obama's presidency, when it was Biden venturing to more states -- including conservative-leaning districts -- where the sitting president was considered a drag on Democratic candidates.\n\nBiden is hardly irritated or even surprised that Obama is more of a draw on the campaign trail this year than him, according to officials. He has discussed some of the races with his former boss and believes Obama's message is both resonating with voters and complementary to his own.\n\nStill, their joint appearance Saturday will only serve to underscore their divergent styles and political abilities -- a comparison even some Democrats say ultimately favors Obama.\n\nBiden goes to Democrat-heavy areas\n\n\"I know you always ask me how we're doing. We're going to win this time around I think. I feel really good about our chances,\" Biden told reporters Friday in California.\n\nThe president has been bullish on Democrats' chances next week, even as many Democrats grow increasingly anxious about their party's prospects. His campaign schedule -- in blue states stumping for candidates in closer-than-expected races -- is itself a signal of Democrats'' vulnerabilities.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Biden has been traveling mostly to blue states he won, but where Democrats are nonetheless running closer-than-expected races. He stopped in New Mexico, California and Illinois before stumping in Pennsylvania on Saturday, and will campaign with the embattled New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday. He'll spend Election Eve in Maryland.\n\nPeople familiar with Biden's thinking say he accepts that not every Democratic candidate will welcome him as a surrogate while his approval ratings remain underwater. And he has told fellow Democrats he respects their political intuition when it comes to their own races.\n\nBut he has grown frustrated at coverage suggesting he is political albatross, according to people familiar with the conversations, arguing his policies -- when properly explained -- are widely popular with voters.\n\nCompared to both Obama and Trump, Biden has held far fewer campaign rallies for his party during this midterm cycle. Most of his engagements over the past month have been official events, delivered to crowds that sometimes only number a few dozen.\n\nHis rallies have begun drawing larger crowds in the waning days of the campaign. Six hundred people had to be turned away from an event in Southern California on Friday, according to the White House. And Biden addressed an overflow crowd in New Mexico that couldn't fit inside the main venue when he was holding a rally with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.\n\n\"I know you don't think it, but I think we have pretty good crowds. They're fairly enthusiastic. You don't write it that way, but they are,\" Biden said as he was departing California on Friday.\n\n'Get ready, that's all I'm saying'\n\nStill, his events haven't generated the same electricity as Obama's. The former president has laid into Trump and his acolytes who are running for office during his string of rallies across the country over the past weeks, using stinging humor and an air of bemusement to ridicule Republicans.\n\nLike Biden, he's also argued the American system of government is at stake in next week's election, telling a crowd in Arizona that \"democracy as we know it\" could perish if election deniers take office.\n\nObama and Biden last appeared together at the White House in September, when Obama's official portrait was unveiled in the White House East Room. The event had been put off while Trump was in office, partly because neither the Obamas nor the Trumps were interested in putting on a show of friendship.\n\nAs he campaigns for his endorsed candidates this fall, Trump has made little attempt to conceal his larger intentions: to buttress his own likely presidential campaign he hopes will return him to the White House.\n\n\"Get ready, that's all I'm saying,\" Trump told a crowd in Sioux City, Iowa, on Thursday, adding that he \"will very, very probably do it again.\"\n\nTop Trump aides have discussed the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his 2024 presidential campaign if Republicans fare well in the midterm elections, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nFor Biden, the decision may take a little longer. He has pointed to family discussions around the holidays when asked about his own timeline. Members of his political team have made early preparations for a campaign infrastructure, operating under the assumption he will decide to run again.\n\nHis motivating factor, aides say: Whether Trump jumps in himself.\n\n\u00a9 2022 Cable News Network.

According to Biden, he has a very high IQ.  In the above video, taken at April 3, 1987 campaign stop in Claremont, New Hampshire, Biden can be seen sparring with a voter who questioned his academic credentials. Biden responded, \u201cI think I have a much higher I.Q. than you do I suspect. I went to law school on a full academic scholarship \u2013 the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship.\u201d Biden went on to claim that he graduated in the top half of his law school. In his statement today, Mr. Biden, who attended the Syracuse College of Law and graduated 76th in a class of 85, acknowledged: \u201cI did not graduate in the top half of my class at law school and my recollection of this was inaccurate.\u201d \u2026 Newsweek said Mr. Biden had gone to Syracuse \u201con half scholarship based on financial need.\u201d  That seems like a pretty dumb thing to say. But Joe Biden says a lot of dumb things.  \"A man I'm proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next President of the United States \u2014 Barack America!\" --Joe Biden, at his first campaign rally with Barack Obama after being announced as his running mate, Springfield, Ill., Aug. 23, 2008  Also Joe Biden got in trouble for plagiarism. He's fairly unique in having a campaign collapse over a plagiarism scandal..  Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., trying to control mounting damage to his drive for the Democratic presidential nomination, admitted Thursday that he had committed plagiarism during his first year of law school but called the controversy surrounding his borrowed passages in recent speeches \"much ado about nothing.\" In his most detailed response to the controversy, which began during the weekend, Biden told a news conference that he \"did something very stupid 23 years ago,\" by lifting five pages from a law review article for a brief he wrote in a legal methods class at the University of Syracuse. Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of Virginia, said: \"In my mind, this completely eliminates him from consideration\" for the nomination. \"A plagiarist can clearly not be in the White House.\" Biden's troubles began Saturday, when the New York Times and Des Moines Register noted the similarities between a rousing speech made by Neil Kinnock, the British Labor Party leader, and one delivered by Biden at a presidential debate at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 23. Biden's problems deepened when other newspapers noted similarities between a Biden speech to the California Democratic Party in February and rhetoric by the late Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy, at Fordham University in June, 1967, said: \"Few will have the greatness to bend history itself. But each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation.\"  That's pretty dumb. And Biden's response to 9/11? Really dumb.  I\u2019m groping here,\u201d Joe says. For once he isn\u2019t referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs, massaging, squeezing, caressing. Instead he\u2019s talking about foreign policy. The Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has no clue. Joe is worried that the Muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us. And he has a plan to make them feel better. \u201cSeems to me this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for $200 million to Iran,\u201d Senator Joe Biden says.

Biden is seen by many as a Democrat who excels at speaking to working class families across the racial spectrum, but still has a history of legislative experience as success as a Senator from Delaware and then as a two-term Vice President.Biden would likely be able to tap into existing Democratic donors if he ran, as he has near 100% name recognition domestically and internationally. Besides First Lady Michelle Obama, he would probably be the public figure to benefit most from an association with President Obama.Biden considered running in the 2016 election, but decided against it after the tragic death of his son Beau Biden.

In this case, he will only endorse one of the dumbest men in Washington DC for our next President if he agrees to his radical terms.How very  Putin-esque The talk in Democratic Party circles is that Barack Obama has told Joe Biden that he is prepared to endorse him for president if, in return, Biden promises to let Obama have a final say in the choice of his vice presidential running mate.According to these Democratic sources, Biden is mulling over the president s conditional offer of support.In addition, there is speculation among top Democratic sources that Obama has another quid pro quo for his endorsement: he wants Biden to choose an African American as his vice presidential running mate.In this scenario, which Obama has not yet fully explained to Biden, Biden would promise to serve only one term in the White House, after which he would back his vice president to succeed him.As Biden s vice president, Obama is said to favor former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a close Obama ally who is the first and only African American to have served as governor of the Bay State.Obama has already given Biden carte blanche to use Air Force Two, the official vice presidential plane, to crisscross the country and launch an unofficial campaign.So far, Biden has visited several key primary and general election states and hammered GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, charging that Trump is offering a  sick message  on immigration.Biden has also courted the Jewish vote, hinting that he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.With Obama s blessing, Biden appeared on  The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,  where he discussed his son Beau s death from brain cancer and came across as an authentic alternative to the stiff and overly scripted Hillary Clinton.

Biden was furious and he put the heckler in his place effortlessly.Bill Ackman, manager of a failing hedge fund, was speaking at the wall street event as well. Fox Business reports that during the private VIP dinner, former Florida governor and 2016 GOP presidential contender Jeb Bush, asked Biden why didn t you run? Biden explained that part of the decision stemmed from the death of his son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015. The room grew quiet as Biden became emotional, and said:  I m sorry I ve said enough. That s when Ackman blurted out  Why? That s never stopped you before. The formal, and understated dinner conversation suddenly turned tense, according to three people who were present and confirmed both the substance and the wording of Biden s responses.Biden, these people say, turned to someone seated near him, and asked,  who is this asshole?,  a reference to Ackman.Then he turned directly to Ackman and stated:  look, I don t know who you are, wiseass, but never disrespect the memory of my dead son!  these people say.Ackman attempted what was described as an apology, to which Biden said,  just shut the hell up. A spokesman for Ackman insisted that the idea that there was an argument or altercation between Joe Biden and Bill Ackman  is just utter nonsense. He even added that  Bill had a great time at the dinner and enjoyed spending time with the former vice president. But three different sources who witnessed the exchange say otherwise. Biden was in rare form,  said one person with direct knowledge of the heated conversation.  I can t believe it has never leaked out. There are some lines you just don t cross and this is one of them. Why Ackman thought he could get away with making this kind of remark is anybody s guess. But Biden was NOT having it and in the process, he proved that he has plenty of spunk left for a 2020 presidential run. I never thought she was a great candidate. I thought I was a great candidate, Biden said at the dinner, which raises speculation that he may decide to run for president in the next election. While Biden, who is 74, would be the oldest candidate to ever run for the White House, he certainly seems up to the task.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",

For many, their first exposure to him was when they watched him decimate Sarah Palin in the pre-election debates with a brilliant mind, clever wit and award-winning smile. Four years later, it was Paul Ryan who looked like a deer caught in the headlights as VP Biden considered his preposterous answers in their debates together and couldn t help but bust out in that ever-popular Joe Biden laugh.Joe Biden is one of the good ones. He s one of us. He s not a wealthy man or a sleezy politician who manages to live large off of campaign war chests; he s just a man   who happens to be second in line for the most powerful office in the world.Last year we were thrust into the personal life of Joe Biden and his family when his beloved son Beau, who the vice president calls his  soul,  was taken from him after a battle with cancer. What many people don t know is the incredible support Mr. Biden received from the only man he can call  boss,  President Barack Obama. The president delivered a beautiful and unforgettable eulogy for Beau, but according to an interview Biden did Monday with CNN, that was just the tip of the iceberg of the love and friendship he showed the Vice President.According to Biden, after Beau had the stroke that began the path towards his passing, President Obama came RUNNING down the hallway of the hospital to see if his friend and colleague was OK. Biden assured the president that he would be; that he and his wife would sell their house to get by and take care of Beau if need be.In an incredible act of selflessness and kindness, our President offered to give Joe Biden and his family whatever financial support they needed to weather the storm. As he tells the story you can see the tears welling up in his eyes. He says repeatedly that he s certain the president will be upset that he made such a personal notion public, but this man obviously wants the country to know exactly what kind of man sits in the Oval Office.He goes on to talk about the president and his family and how they are HIS family. How the President s daughters have sleepovers with his granddaughters and how much the special friendship between them has meant.Warning: The interview is a tear-jerker. Never have I been more proud of our president MY president or more thankful for having had the opportunity to witness his historic and monumentally successful administration than I am after watching this video:Featured image via screen capture",

                              "text": "President Donald Trump speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Friday, May 18, 2018, during a Prison Reform Summit. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  NEW YORK \u2014 He is the Republican Party's most powerful political weapon. Yet as the GOP fights to defend its delicate House and Senate majorities, President Donald Trump is not welcome everywhere.  Some Republican candidates fear that the unscripted and relatively unpopular president could do more harm than good should he campaign on their behalf. Leading party strategists want Trump to focus his time and energy on a handful of Senate contests in deep-red states where Democratic incumbents are particularly vulnerable. In swing states \u2014 especially across America's suburbs, where the House majority will be decided \u2014 some would prefer that he stay away.  \"I would like the president to do his job and I'll do mine,\" Dan David, a Republican congressional hopeful fighting to preserve a GOP-held seat in suburban Philadelphia, said when asked if he'd like Trump to visit his district.  \"I win or lose on my team's merits,\" David said. \"I think that the president has a very, very full plate with foreign affairs and special prosecutor investigations.\"  This aversion to Trump is something the White House needs to take into account as it decides how best to deploy the president in the months leading up to the November midterm elections. But it's unclear how much Trump will heed strategists' guidance, or candidates' wishes, as he picks his targets.  The current White House strategy calls for Trump to focus on fundraising and campaigning in states key to control of the Senate, including Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, North Dakota, Missouri, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, according to a person familiar with the president's strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.  Vice President Mike Pence will be heavily involved in the Senate effort and also in House races, especially in rural areas that are more difficult for the president to reach.  Closer to Election Day, Trump is expected to shift his attention to rallies designed to bolster get-out-the-vote efforts.  Next on Trump's schedule: a trip to Tennessee later this month for a Nashville rally and a fundraiser in support of Rep. Marsha Blackburn's Senate campaign.  The White House's political team has a close relationship with most of the top Republican Senate campaigns, regularly sharing details on policy announcements and messaging. But Trump's travel decisions, so far at least, have been decided by the White House with little input from the Republican candidates on the ground.  Friends and foes alike acknowledge that in some parts of the country Trump can be extraordinarily effective by energizing his supporters. In others, his efforts have the potential to backfire by motivating Democrats or repelling skeptical independents and suburban Republicans.  \"It's a matter of picking your locations very strategically,\" said Republican pollster Chris Wilson, who is involved in several midterm contests.  \"Going to Florida, anywhere in the Central Time Zone would be a fantastic place for him to campaign,\" Wilson said, referring to a narrow slice of the state along the Panhandle. \"I'd love to have Donald Trump in east Texas, parts of south Texas where he's still popular. Other parts of south Texas maybe not.\"  Florida Gov. Rick Scott, now running for the Senate, has appeared to be distancing himself from the president.  When he announced his candidacy last month, Scott would not say whether he wanted Trump to campaign on his behalf. A campaign spokesman declined to answer the same question this week.  In Missouri, Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley has managed Trump's early visits differently. He did not attend the president's first appearance in the state last year, joining him at a November rally before attending a private fundraising with Trump this spring.  Hawley campaign manager Kyle Plotkin made clear the campaign would welcome more attention from the White House.  \"We would love to have the president come back to the state,\" Plotkin said. \"The president's agenda is popular, and people in Missouri want to see Trump and Republicans in charge.\"  It's much the same in Indiana, where Trump campaigned this month alongside Republican Senate nominee Mike Braun. The president insulted incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly, calling him \"Sleepin' Joe.\"  While the nickname confused some Republicans in the state, Missouri Republican strategist Cam Savage said the president injected a welcome dose of energy into the election.  \"Air Force One makes a lot of noise when it lands,\" Savage said. \"There isn't anything in American public life that comes close to that. If you're a candidate and you want attention, there's no better way.\"  Other presidents also have faced questions about their midterm strategy.  President Barack Obama was shunned by many Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections as he struggled with relatively low approval ratings. He focused his efforts on fundraising for his party and rallying black voters.  It was almost worse for President George W. Bush in the 2006 midterm elections. Eager to help his party in the weeks leading up to Election Day, Bush was relegated to appearing in Republican strongholds like Georgia and Texas in the campaign's final days.  Trump's approval ratings have ticked up in recent months, but they remain slightly below those of Bush and Obama at the same time.  There is another cause for caution with Trump: his unpredictability.  As he has proven throughout his brief political career, the president is one unscripted comment away from creating a headache for those he's trying to help. There's fear that his name-calling and aggressive anti-immigrant rhetoric will turn off Hispanic voters, moderate Republicans and suburban women in key areas.  The results from Trump's early midterm efforts have been positive, said Steven Law, who heads the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC that expects to spend tens of millions of dollars helping Senate Republicans this year.  \"Can't use him everywhere. There are risks in certain places,\" Law said. \"But it just feels to me that you have a White House that is clearly cognizant of how to best deploy him, and he seems to be aware of that as well.\"  He added, \"One of the concerns is whether he'll stick to script.\"",

                              "text": "Most Americans have probably heard the parable of the blind men and the elephant. There are different versions of the story, but the basic idea is that a group of blind men encounter an elephant, and they each touch different parts of it. One man feels the tail, another the leg, another the ear, and so on. They each come away with a true view of what an elephant is like, but it\u2019s an incomplete view.  There\u2019s more than one way to think about this story\u2014some see it as a metaphor for the monotheistic religions and God, others simply see it as an illustration of how all of our perspectives are limited\u2014but it works surprisingly well as a political metaphor. The elephant right now is (obviously) the Trump-era GOP, and the blind men are the analysts, reporters, and researchers like myself trying to understand it.  For the last two and a half years, we have tried a variety of tools\u2014polls, analysis of legislation, interviews with everyone from voters to top Republicans, statistical analysis of election results, and combinations of these tools\u2014to get a handle on the GOP and how Trump has and hasn\u2019t changed the party. Each of the approaches is helpful, but none tells the full story. And there are the related questions of who Republicans are, what they believe, and what they do. All together these might give us a better sense of exactly how much the president has changed the party.  The Chicken and the Egg  To see this, we need to rewind to 1992. That year, Bill Clinton won a three-way presidential race against Ross Perot and George H.W. Bush partially by posting a solid showing among blue-collar white voters. According to exit polls , Clinton won among whites without a college degree in 1992 and 1996. But in the elections since, Republicans have steadily gained strength among working-class whites.On the morning after the 2016 election, many Republicans woke up to a political party they didn\u2019t recognize. Traditionally Republican suburbanites had fled, white blue-collar Democrats had hopped aboard , and a former reality-TV star from the party\u2019s populist wing was the most powerful Republican (and person) in the world. It would be easy to look at what happened and conclude that Trump had reshaped the party. But an examination of historical data shows that Trump wasn\u2019t just a cause of the demographic\u2014and by extension, ideological\u2014changes in the party, he was also an effect.    The chart above shows two trends. The blue trend is simply the Republican candidate\u2019s win margin among white voters without a college degree from 1980 to 2016. Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush showed some strength with non-college educated voters in their landslide 1980, 1984, and 1988 victories, but Bill Clinton was able to win some back and edge out both Bush and Bob Dole with that group.  The trend is a bit noisy after that, but when you correct for the national popular vote (that is, subtract out the Republican margin of victory or defeat in the popular vote), it becomes clearer (the orange line). Republicans have been gaining ground with working-class whites for 20 years. Exit polls have their issues , but the academic American National Election Studies (ANES) surveys paint a roughly similar picture .  Put simply, blue-collar whites have been trending towards the GOP for a while, and there\u2019s evidence that some of these key voters for Trump\u2014especially in the Midwest\u2014were trending away from the Democrats during the Obama era.    Let\u2019s take a look at Wisconsin. (See maps, above.)  The story here is pretty simple. Mitt Romney lost Wisconsin in the 2012 presidential election by seven points , and Republican governor Scott Walker won it by six points in 2014 . The difference is striking\u2014Walker carried a large, mostly rural swath of the state that Romney did not. And when Trump won the state by less than a point in 2016 , he showed strength in those same areas. There are obvious differences between these three cases (e.g., Walker was an incumbent, turnout is different in midterm and presidential elections, Obama was on the ballot in 2012 but not in 2014 or 2016, etc.). But it wouldn\u2019t have been unreasonable to look at those two maps in 2014 and conclude that the Republicans could gain some votes in the rural Midwest in 2016.  We can see a similar phenomenon in Iowa. Romney won only 54 percent of the vote in Iowa\u2019s rural counties in 2012 (which cast about a quarter of the votes for the two major parties in the state). But in 2014, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst won 64 percent of the two-party rural vote\u2014foreshadowing Trump\u2019s 67 percent in those same counties in 2016. Ernst and Trump also outperformed Romney in Iowa\u2019s small towns and ended up winning by eight and nine points respectively. ( Romney lost Iowa .)  These parallels aren\u2019t perfect. They don\u2019t hold up in every state (e.g., both Trump and Republican governor Rick Snyder won in Michigan, but Trump outperformed Snyder in rural areas while Snyder was stronger than Trump in the key suburban counties), and it\u2019s hard to know how many of these working-class white voters would have crossed over to the GOP if the party had run a different candidate. But Ernst and Walker foreshadowed future Republican strength and suggest that Trump did not have to singlehandedly bring those swing states into the Republican fold.  Blue-collar whites weren\u2019t the only group to switch their vote in 2016. There\u2019s evidence that many college-educated whites moved away from the GOP , and here Trump is likely more responsible. According to ANES data , Republican presidential candidates generally won college-educated white voters by mid-to-high single digits in every election from 1992 through 2012. Pew\u2019s party identification data (which don\u2019t track votes but has the advantage of being taken more frequently than every four years) show some decline in Republican affiliation during the middle of the Aughts, but the trend isn\u2019t nearly as sharp as what we see among white high-school graduates or white voters who have some college education. Yet, according to an analysis of Cooperative Congressional Elections Studies data by the University of Virginia\u2019s Geoffrey Skelley, Clinton won among white college-educated voters .  If we pull all of this data together, we start to see a clear story. As Democratic presidential candidates drifted leftward culturally (compare Bill Clinton to Al Gore, Gore to John Kerry, Kerry to Obama, and Obama to Hillary Clinton ), they lost ground with the white working class. Racism and sexism likely played a role for some voters, but it\u2019s not a full explanation, as the trend predates Obama or Hil-lary Clinton leading the Democratic ticket. The 2016 election was another step in that direction, with Trump both making further inroads with the white working class and repelling a number of normally reliable college-educated white voters.  Blue-collar white voters have also begun leaving their mark on the GOP. According to political scientist Lee Drut-man\u2019s calculations for the Voter Study Group , the Obama voters who went for Trump were primarily \u201cpopulist\u201d\u2014generally liberal on economic issues but more conservative on some combination of social issues, racial attitudes, and immigration. Republican politicians in states that shifted heavily right (Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, and Minnesota) are feeling some pressure to cater to these new voters and keep them in the fold.  But these new voters are only a small percentage of the GOP. Some of Trump\u2019s natural constituents have been part of the party for much longer. As Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics has argued , Pat Buchanan, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum showed in different ways that there is a real audience within the GOP for hawkish immigration policies, less than free-market positions on the economy, and cultural conservatism in general. Trump won the 2016 presidential nomination in part by winning over voters who felt immigration was the most important issue , and, in 2014, immigration hardliners had fared well in GOP primaries .  Trump can be seen then as both a cause and an effect of the changes in the Republican party. He attracted some new blue-collar voters, but the downscale whites that powered his primary wins were already part of the party. Some of the Obama-voting blue-collar whites who helped him win the Electoral College were headed to the right, as well. Trump pulled the party in his direction by shedding traditionally Republican college-educated whites and grabbing some populist blue-collar whites\u2014but the preexisting political trends are part of that story.  Republicans Trust Trump  The average voter doesn\u2019t have strong, stable preferences on every area of public policy . Most don\u2019t have time to read white papers on Syria or the national debt\u2014they have full-time jobs, kids to raise, friends to visit, hobbies to pursue, and more. So when a politician takes an unorthodox stance (e.g., when Trump has argued for universal healthcare ), sometimes the rank and file will just follow the leader . Republicans are no exception to this rule.  More than one survey has shown that when Trump takes a political position, many Republican voters adopt that position. Some of the most striking examples come from Ariel Edwards-Levy of the HuffPost Pollster. Edwards-Levy worked with the polling firm YouGov to measure how much Republicans and Democrats follow their leaders\u2014that is, if voters would suddenly move left or right on policy if they heard that a key politician broke with party orthodoxy. They told part of their sample that Barack Obama supported universal healthcare, told the other part that Donald Trump supported it, and compared the results.  When YouGov told respondents that Obama supported universal healthcare, 82 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans agreed with him. But when YouGov told the second group of voters that Trump had praised universal healthcare, the results were wildly different\u201446 percent of Democrats and 44 percent of Republicans agreed with him. Similarly, when YouGov told voters that John Kerry wanted to keep the Iran nuclear deal in place and strictly enforce it, 52 percent of Democrats agreed with Kerry and 20 percent of Republicans did. But when YouGov told the second group that Trump held the same position (he has at some point held all of these positions), 54 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Republicans agreed with Trump.  The effect of swapping Trump\u2019s name for a Democrat\u2019s isn\u2019t always this strong. When YouGov told Republicans that Hillary Clinton was against cutting social security, 57 percent of the party agreed with her. When Trump\u2019s name was subbed in, that number went up to 74 percent. But the overall point is clear\u2014if Trump moves to the left on policy, many Republicans will follow him. And this follow-the-leader effect isn\u2019t just an oddity confined to clever survey experiments.  According to an April study by Pew Research , Republican views on free trade have shifted hugely in the short Trump era. Prior to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Pew found that a majority of Republicans believed free trade was good for the United States\u2014the longtime conservative position. But in late 2016, Pew found that only 29 percent of Republicans said that free-trade agreements were beneficial for the country. Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews also examined these results and thinks that Republican opinion on free trade has rebounded slightly from that low point , but the basic story is clear: Trump bucked conservative orthodoxy on free trade, and a significant segment of the party followed his lead.  Trump has also led Republicans to change their opinions on the personal character of presidents and the importance of political experience. According to a 2011 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute , only 36 percent of Republicans believed that a politician who had committed immoral acts in his or her personal life could still execute his or her duties ethically while in office. By 2016, that number had shot up to 70 percent . It\u2019s possible that other events between 2011 and 2016 contributed to this movement\u2014Democrats also became more accepting of morally dubious leaders in that same time, moving from 49 percent to 61 percent on the same question). But it\u2019s not hard to draw a dotted line between the rise of Trump (whose personal life is anything but spotless) and the GOP\u2019s changing tune on the personal morality of leaders.  Similarly, Pew found that between March and September 2015 the percentage of Republicans who preferred \u201cnew ideas and a different approach\u201d over \u201cexperience and a proven record\u201d grew from 36 percent to 65. Trump only announced his run for the Republican nomination in June of that year, so it\u2019s possible that not all of this increase came from his entry onto the political scene. But it provides more evidence that Republicans were willing to change what they expected of political leaders in response to Trump.  Trump has also shifted Republican views of Russia and the FBI. According to YouGov polling data cited by Dylan Matthews , Republicans have become more positive about Vladimir Putin since Trump entered the presidential race.    The chart above shows the net favorability rating of Putin among Republicans over time in YouGov surveys. There\u2019s a significant amount of noise here, but the pattern is simple. As Trump became more politically powerful, Republicans began to view Putin more favorably. The Russian dictator still has a net-negative favorability among the GOP, and there are signs that his rating is dropping. But these polls are part of a broader story. YouGov has also seen a spike in GOP friendliness towards Russia in general \u2014specifically, they measured how many Republican respondents said Russia was an \u201cally/friendly\u201d or \u201cenemy/unfriendly\u201d and found that GOP\u2019s overall rating assessment of Russia has become less negative in the Trump era.  At the same time, Republicans have soured on the FBI. SurveyMonkey recently found that only 38 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of the FBI. As pollster Will Jordan points out , that\u2019s a significant shift from 2015 when Pew found that 70 percent of Republicans viewed the FBI favorably. The story of Trump and Russia is knotty\u2014it involves a special investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, Putin\u2019s human rights violations, and a long history of tension between the United States and Russia. But the public opinion story seems simple and troubling: The ostensibly hawkish, law-and-order Republican party is more accepting of Russia and Vladimir Putin now that Donald Trump is its leader.  It\u2019s worth noting that Trump hasn\u2019t changed the GOP\u2019s position on every issue. He hasn\u2019t always been pro-life and has shown his ignorance of traditional conservative policy on the issue (e.g., Trump\u2019s assertion that there should be \u201c some form of punishment \u201d for women who seek abortions is not shared by many pro-lifers). But according to the long-running General Social Survey (a project of NORC at the University of Chicago), Trump-era Republicans are roughly as pro-life as Republicans were in the late 1990s . Michael Barber and Jeremy Pope of BYU (who conducted a survey experiment similar to Edwards-Levy\u2019s) have also seen that Trump is less able to move GOP opinion on gun control than he is on other issues.    And there are issues where the trends predate Trump. Republicans have been softening on LGBTQ issues for decades , and it\u2019s not clear that Trump\u2019s leftward leanings on such issues have moved the needle.  But overall, it seems that there are real differences between what the pre-Trump GOP and the Trump-era party believe. Trump didn\u2019t completely rework conservative ideology or change Republican thinking on every issue. But Republicans have followed his lead on some policy issues (trade) and have accommodated him by changing their views about morality and the world (Russia). Some of these changes might not stick\u2014the GOP might fall back on its instinctual distrust of Russia and trust of the FBI when the Mueller investigation is resolved. But it\u2019s also possible to imagine parts of Trumpism\u2014like the suspicion of trade and tough rhetoric on immigration\u2014calcifying and becoming GOP orthodoxy. It\u2019s too early to say which changes will or won\u2019t stick, but for the time being there are differences between how pre-Trump and Trump-era Republicans think about the world.  The Republicans Strike Back  Trump may have changed the way the GOP thinks, looks, and talks, but as many others have previously argued , Republicans have also changed Trump. Specifically, the policy pushes in Trump\u2019s first year in office were at their core efforts to turn conservative promises into policy. Trump was out of sync with GOP orthodoxy on a number of issues during the campaign\u2014attacking trade deals, calling for vast infrastructure spending and building a \u201cwall,\u201d instituting universal healthcare, and more\u2014yet he\u2019s spent much of his political capital on legislation that a more conventional Republican president might have come up with.  First, there was healthcare. Before the 2016 election, Trump made numerous contradictory statements about healthcare , some of which sounded more like a call for universal healthcare than for a conservative effort to overturn Obamacare. Yet last spring, Trump supported congressional Republicans in their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans tried multiple different bills and failed. Throughout the process, Trump (mostly) backed the conservative reforms that House speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell championed.Trump may have changed the way the GOP thinks, looks, and talks, but as many others have previously argued , Republicans have also changed Trump. Specifically, the policy pushes in Trump\u2019s first year in office were at their core efforts to turn conservative promises into policy. Trump was out of sync with GOP orthodoxy on a number of issues during the campaign\u2014attacking trade deals, calling for vast infrastructure spending and building a \u201cwall,\u201d instituting universal healthcare, and more\u2014yet he\u2019s spent much of his political capital on legislation that a more conventional Republican president might have come up with.  It\u2019s a similar story on taxes. Before Trump won the 2016 election, many speculated that he would be an economic populist\u2014someone who would move the Republican party leftward on economic issues while pulling it to the right on cultural issues . But in December, Trump signed a traditionally conservative tax-reform bill . It\u2019s hard to tell whether Trump\u2019s core beliefs have changed since 2016, but more traditional Republicans seem to have been able to influence his economic actions.  Trump nominated a staunch conservative for the Supreme Court . Neil Gorsuch is someone almost any Republican president might have placed on the high court. This isn\u2019t as clear-cut a case of conservative influence as taxes or healthcare. But it\u2019s another instance of Trump\u2019s essentially doing what another Republican would have done on policy.  Still, he hasn\u2019t been a predictable Republican president on every issue.  After multiple fights with various courts, Trump successfully instituted restrictions on travel to the United States from eight nations (six of which are predominantly Muslim). There\u2019s room for disagreement within the GOP on foreign policy and immigration, but it is hard to imagine a different Republican president (Marco Rubio, for example, or John Kasich) taking that action.  Trump has also focused much less on the national debt than a more conventional Republican might have. He didn\u2019t mention it in his most recent State of the Union address , and it didn\u2019t seem to be a primary concern during the debate late last year over tax reform. It\u2019s possible to argue that past Republicans have failed to live up to their campaign promises on the deficit, but failing even to talk about the issue (much less try to act on it) is a significant departure from past GOP policy.  The point here isn\u2019t to go through every area of policy and compare Trump\u2019s actions, his prior statements, and traditional GOP orthodoxy. The point is to show that change isn\u2019t a one-way street. While Trump has acted on some of his policy instincts, traditional Republicans have still managed to push (and in some cases successfully enact) their policies during the Trump era.  The traditional GOP\u2019s influence makes sense. Trump is a newcomer to politics, and as political scientists Matt Grossmann and Dave Hopkins showed persuasively in their 2016 book Asymmetric Politics, the GOP is a fundamentally ideological party. Trump may not have had fully fleshed-out view on various policy issues (he contradicted himself many times during the 2016 campaign), but the larger Republican party did. And Republicans have been able to get Trump to move towards them on many policies.  The Opportunity Lost  The question of how Trump changed the Republican party is obviously complicated, and the data and analysis presented here only scratch the surface. I\u2019m ignoring some of the below-the-radar aspects of Trump\u2019s domestic and foreign policies, his tendency to break norms, his relationship to the media and other institutions, and his effect on racial attitudes. In all of these areas and more, I could track ways in which Trump has or hasn\u2019t changed his party (and vice versa). But a pattern is clear, and it\u2019s worth turning our attention instead to a related question: What changes did the Republican party forgo by nominating and electing Donald Trump?  It\u2019s possible to argue , and many have, that Trump won the Republican nomination because the party\u2019s three-legged stool (social conservatism, fiscal conservatism, and a hawkish foreign policy) failed during George W. Bush\u2019s administration and Trump offered something new and different.  The legs of the stool have seen plenty of wins, losses, and draws over the last 35 years. Fiscal conservatism certainly posted wins when Reagan and Bush cut taxes, but it\u2019s also seen some losses\u2014the national debt has increased and the financial crash happened on Bush\u2019s watch. Foreign-policy hawkishness served the Republican party well during the Cold War and after, but that leg of the stool suffered serious injury during the Iraq War. And while religious conservatives can point to public opinion remaining relatively stable on abortion, they lost the battle on same-sex marriage.  But no matter how you tally up the score, you end up with a Republican party that often runs and governs on ideas that have already won or lost the battles they were designed to fight. The social and political problems facing the United States aren\u2019t identical to the problems it faced in the 1980s. Yet Trump\u2019s GOP, which arguably has more power now than any iteration of the party has had since the 1920s , hasn\u2019t come up with anything more creative than another tax bill and a few attempts to overturn Obamacare.  The 2016 election provided Republicans with an opportunity to apply conservative principles to new problems in healthy, innovative, and constructive ways. But the GOP chose Trump. And Trump\u2019s lasting impact on the GOP might in the end not be the policies he enacts, the positions he takes, or the way he changes politics, it may be that he kept the party from renewing itself despite having a real opportunity to do so. \u00a8  David Byler is a staff writer at The Weekly Standard.",

                              "text": "After months of confidence that public discontent with President Trump would lift Democrats back to power in Congress, some party leaders are fretting that their advantages in this year\u2019s midterms are eroding amid a shifting political landscape.  Driving their concerns are Trump\u2019s approval rating, which has ticked upward in recent weeks, and high Republican turnout in some recent primaries, suggesting the GOP base remains energized. What\u2019s more, Republicans stand to benefit politically from a thriving economy and are choosing formidable candidates to take on vulnerable Democratic senators.  One of their biggest sources of anxiety is the Senate race in Florida, where some Democrats fear that three-term Sen. Bill Nelson has not adequately prepared to defend his seat against Gov. Rick Scott, a well-financed former businessman handpicked for the race by Trump. Scott and Nelson are close in early polls.  \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the race. I think everybody is,\u201d said Ione Townsend, the Democratic Party chair in Hillsborough County, home to Tampa. Townsend said it will \u201cbe hard to compete\u201d with Scott\u2019s money.  The growing alarm about Nelson, one of 10 Democratic senators running this year in a state won by Trump in 2016, prompted the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), to sound the alarm a few months ago in a private meeting in which he pleaded with Nelson to step up his efforts and hire a campaign manager, which he did not do until March, according to people familiar with the conversation.  In West Virginia, where Trump won by about 42 points and Republicans gave the president credit last week for urging voters to reject the primary candidacy of a former coal executive who had served jail time, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III acknowledged that Trump\u2019s popularity in the state is a major boon for the Republicans.  \u201cThe more he can stay out of West Virginia and direct his energies elsewhere would be helpful,\u201d Manchin said.  [In Senate primaries, Republicans avoid their worst-case fears]  Democratic worries are mounting in the House, as well, where the party has been more confident of gaining the 23 seats it needs to retake the majority. Democrats are picking strong candidates in dozens of Republican-held suburban districts where Trump has lost significant support \u2014 but recent surveys suggest the races may be tightening.  Trump\u2019s approval is now at the highest point it has been all year, measured by Gallup in early May at 42 percent, a five-point increase from the start of 2018. Meanwhile, the Democrats\u2019 advantage when voters are asked which party they want to control Congress has shrunk, from 10 points in December to just six now, according to a Washington Post average of recent quality polls.  And Republicans are showing signs they will fight for the House, with GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson agreeing to give $30 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC backed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), according to a person familiar with the donation.  \u201cI think anyone who was proclaiming victory a couple of months ago was premature,\u201d said Rep. Daniel Kildee of Michigan, who is a member of the leadership team of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cI think the president\u2019s standing obviously has some impact.\u201d  Republicans still have plenty of reasons to worry. While Trump\u2019s numbers have improved, his standing is still historically low for a first-term president, and his administration continues to face scandals and chaos, as well as the expanding inquiry by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference in the 2016 election.  History shows a president\u2019s first midterm does not usually go well for his party. And recent special election results signal a strong year for Democrats, including their stunning win in the Alabama Senate race and the victory this year by a Democrat in a Pittsburgh-area district that Trump had won by nearly 20 points.  Republican leaders, many of whom were previously uneasy about Trump and his brand of nationalistic politics and had clashed with him early in his tenure, have in recent weeks embraced the president, in large part because the party\u2019s success could hinge on keeping his base fired up.  In private conversations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has advised Trump not to criticize the Senate, said three people familiar with the discussions. McConnell told Trump that it is not good for either Trump or McConnell if voters feel as though it makes no difference whether they choose Republicans to represent them there.  McConnell has also urged the president to work with him to promote electable Republican Senate candidates. Lately, Trump has heeded his advice.  He warned West Virginia Republicans not to vote for Don Blankenship, who served prison time for his conviction on mine safety violations and used racial epithets. On May 8, Blankenship lost the primary to state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a more mainstream candidate.  Republican officials are touting the GOP tax cuts, although polls suggest they have not been the political godsend the party had predicted, as well as Trump\u2019s upcoming summit with North Korea\u2019s leader, which stirs hope of stability and detente.  \u201cPeace and prosperity\u2019s a pretty good platform,\u201d said Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.  Some local Democrats are nervous about the general election.  \u201cI do worry. I think the pharmaceutical companies are going to throw all kinds of money in here,\u201d said Marion Tanner, chair of the Fayette County Democratic Executive Committee in West Virginia. Morrisey has past lobbying ties to the pharmaceutical industry.  Trump and McConnell welcomed the Republicans nominated for Senate in Indiana and Ohio on May 8. Trump held a campaign rally in Indiana on Thursday, where he stayed remarkably on message and praised the GOP nominee, Mike Braun.  \u201cYou saw a template for what you\u2019ll see moving forward,\u201d said White House political director Bill Stepien, referring to Trump\u2019s rhetoric at the rally in Elkhart, Ind.  [At Indiana rally, Trump stays on message with an eye on midterms]  White House officials are trying to complement Trump\u2019s efforts on the campaign trail by making Congress look better. At a recent briefing hosted by the White House\u2019s Office of Public Liaison, Stepien emphasized that Republicans could help motivate their base by showing that the Senate was working, according to a person who attended the meeting.  Like others interviewed for this story, the person spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.  During a Senate Republican luncheon Thursday, Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) distributed pocket cards to senators that listed what the GOP has done since last year to help them remind voters. The cards included the tax law, repealing regulations and confirming conservative judges.  Nationally, Republican strategists said they believe that by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, engaging with North Korea and pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal, Trump is giving conservative voters a powerful reminder of the blows he has landed against the policies of President Barack Obama.  Trump\u2019s North Korea strategy has resonated with Keith Lowry, chairman of the Jefferson County Republican Executive Committee in West Virginia.  \u201cHis presentation leaves a lot of people lacking. And they don\u2019t necessarily agree with his brash techniques or the way he tweets a lot,\u201d Lowry said of Trump. \u201cBut the essence and the substance of the man \u2014 you just can\u2019t argue with the accomplishments.\u201d  In Florida, Scott\u2019s entrance into the race not only boosted Republican chances of flipping Nelson\u2019s seat, it also ensured that Democrats would have to spend more cash in the state that they would otherwise dedicate to other states.  Scott is wealthy and has a strong national fundraising network. He raised as much money in three weeks \u2014 $3.2 million \u2014 as Nelson did in three months.  On Saturday, Nelson held one of his first campaign events since Scott launched his campaign.  Republicans still have messy intraparty fights to navigate in Mississippi and Arizona, with polarizing Senate candidates who party officials believe could lose to Democrats. They are plotting ways to elevate the more electable ones.  If Democrats can flip one or both of those seats, their path to the majority will be easier, contingent on holding seats. Democrats also have a plum opportunity for a pickup in Nevada.  Democratic senators have focused on issues such as health care, veterans and local matters rather than the national parties or culture wars. They are wagering that they don\u2019t need to stoke the anti-Trump sentiment that is prevalent among base voters; they need to convince Republicans that it is okay to cross over.  Even in the House, where elections tend to align more closely to the national mood, candidates are trying to distinguish themselves on a personal level.  \u201cAnyone who\u2019s counting on a national wave to carry her into office isn\u2019t much of a candidate,\u201d said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who is running in a district where Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 10 points. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to run your own race and you have to be your own person.\u201d  Scott Clement contributed to this report.

Add Interest  He is fighting. But he's not fighting alone.  Another week punctuated by both soaring words and petty squabbles made clear that if there are two sides of President Donald Trump, the Republican Party is on board for both of them.  The president on display at the State of the Union address offered a political and electoral roadmap for the party. It\u2019s a story of GOP winning and a growing economy that had Republicans remembering the promise of Trump from the start.  The president on display in seeking to discredit the Mueller investigations \u2013 the one now warring with his own FBI and Justice Department, and poised to release the Nunes memo \u2013 offers a harsher side of Trump than when he is calling for national unity. But his ability to find allies in Congress and beyond for those fights remains striking.  The memo push is the latest, though surely not the last, example of the GOP rallying to Trump\u2019s defense. The implications are substantial \u2013 but the president has plenty of company.  The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks  Members of the Republican National Committee ended the week feeling the wind was at their backs.

After all, even establishment folks like what they have seen in terms of policy, including deregulation, drilling and taxes.  They think their team played the government shutdown better and that Democrats sitting down during almost every line of the State of the Union was bad optics, too. As tricky as the midterms may be for this bunch, there are a few Senate seats these RNC strategists think they can pick up.  A basic message about small government still plays well, party spokespeople argued, in races from the northeast to Alaska.  The TIP with Emily Goodin  Republican state chairmen and women and their staff who came in from the states \u2013 where the 2018 midterms will take place \u2013 are hopeful about their odds in November.  The mood at the Republican National Committee winter meeting at the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., was upbeat and cheerful on Thursday.  Even though polling shows voters favor the Democratic candidate on the generic congressional ballot versus the GOP alternative, these Republicans feel the odds may so ever be in their favor.  The Senate races in particular have these leaders hopeful, particularly those red states who have Democratic incumbents. They mentioned that the government shutdown and voting against tax reform are two things that could hurt these incumbents in the months ahead.  President Donald Trump reflected that mood in his remarks at the GOP retreat in West Virginia on Thursday, where he rallied his party and mentioned the midterms.  \u201cWe have to get help from the other side or we have to elect more Republicans,\u201d he said of the GOP trying to accomplish its agenda. \u201cWe have a good chance of doing that. \u201818 is going to be very interesting.\u201d  Very interesting indeed.

WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump called Democrats' stone-faced reaction to his State of the Union address \"treasonous\" and \"un-American\" during a visit to a manufacturing plant in Cincinnati, Ohio Monday.  Trump described Republicans \"going totally crazy wild\" during his State of the Union remarks one week ago, while Democrats remained seated and stone-faced for the majority of the speech. \"They were like death,\" Trump lamented. \"And un-American. Un-American.\"  But the reaction, he said, was also something much worse.  Vaguely noting that \"someone\" called the Democratic reactions \"'treasonous,'\" Trump said he agreed. \"I mean, yeah, I guess. Why not?...Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn't seem to love our country very much.\"  Though the word has gotten plenty of attention in Washington of late, not standing during a speech certainly does not count as treason.  Trump's speech \u2014 billed by the White House as another push for the newly-passed Republican tax plan and \"not a political event\" \u2014 swung wildly from the tax package's finer selling points to the president's rosy outlook on 2018 while he leveled hard knocks against Democrats, specifically House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. As Trump spoke, the stock markets he once used as an example of his positive impact on the economy continued their downward slide.  \"[Pelosi]'s our secret weapon,\" Trump told the Ohio crowd. \"No, she's our secret weapon. I just hope they don't change her,\" he said, referencing Democrats who \"want to run her out\" of her leadership post.  The anti-Pelosi playbook isn't a new one, but it's one Republicans seem likely to brandish again as the 2018 midterms draw near. Recently, Vice President Mike Pence, top Republicans, and even Trump himself have seized on Pelosi's comments likening American monetary gains from the GOP tax bill to \"crumbs\"\u2014 a gaffe the president likened to Hillary Clinton's \"deplorables\" comment during the 2016 election.  Though historically the party in the White House faces tough losses in their first midterm election, President Trump believed he had the root of the problem in hand: electorate complacency.  \"I think I figured it out,\" he said, describing voters as \"happy\" in the aftermath of their side winning the White House, while the other party's supporters are \"desperate\" for a win and thusly more willing to get out and vote in midterm election years.  \"In the midterms, we've got to get out there and win,\" Trump decided, tagging Pelosi, and Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as \"so far left.\"  Trump then doled out at least a partial endorsement of GOP Senate hopeful and current congressman Jim Rinacci, pressing Ohioans to \"get Jim in\" and help Republicans earn \"tremendous success\" in 2018. \"If we don't, we're just foolish,\" Trump chided.  The president was looking past the midterms, too. \"We want to do great in '18, and we're going to do really well in '20,\" he said. \"That's when we go again and we keep this great journey going, okay?\"  But to get there, Trump will first have to overcome the ongoing Russia probe into his campaign's alleged collusion with the Kremlin. A newly-released, controversial Republican memo seeks to discredit information gathering tactics by the FBI and Justice Department, but doesn't actually vindicate Trump despite his tweets over the weekend claiming it did.  On Monday, the president celebrated catching \"them in the act,\" speaking in veiled terms but in an apparent reference to political opponents and law enforcement officials as he made the case for electing more Republicans to Congress.  \"We need them badly too, or it all goes back to where it was and worse,\" he said, interrupting himself to glorify the memo. \"Boy, did we catch them in the act or what? You know what I'm talking about. Oh, did we catch them in the act. They are very embarrassed. They never thought they were gonna get caught. We caught 'em...It's so much fun, we're like the great sleuth.\"  Though the White House did not draft the memo, they did support its public release. It remains unclear if they will come to the same conclusion with a corresponding memo from Democrats on the same topic.  The White House maintained before the rally that there was \"no consideration about any personnel moves at the Department of Justice\" when asked about Trump's confidence in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, one of the top DOJ officials named in the memo.  But that doesn't mean the memo won't herald any change at all. Asked about a second special counsel to look into the DOJ and FBI, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary *Raj Shah* told reporters aboard Air Force One Monday the president's personal attorney \"have called for further review and a second special counsel.\"",

                              "text": "Opinion writer  THE MORNING PLUM:  In certain ways, the battle over the \u201cdreamers\u201d perfectly captures what has become of the Trump-era GOP. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) had dramatically promised that President Trump and Republicans will work to create a way for these young immigrants to stay in the United States, as part of an effort to nudge the party toward an inclusive, aspirational conservatism that has more appeal to younger voters and to a diversifying electorate.  But Trump and many Republicans have instead embraced an agenda shaped around emphatic, full-blown nativism and xenophobia, bringing that push (such as it was) to a screeching halt. Neatly capturing this, social media is exploding over Trump\u2019s suggestion yesterday (though the context makes it somewhat vague) that some of the immigrants he\u2019s deporting are \u201canimals.\u201d  We are now being treated to a striking spectacle: Ryan and his top lieutenants are working overtime to squash an effort by Republicans to force a vote in the House to provide the dreamers with a path to legalization.  Vulnerable Republicans in the House are pushing a discharge petition that would compel a vote on measures that would grant the dreamers legal status, one of them packaged with fortifications to border security. More than 20 Republicans have signed the petition, meaning that if organizers can get a handful more, it would pass, since Democrats will support it \u2014 forcing a full House vote on whether the dreamers will be protected or remain in limbo. Make no mistake: Such a full vote \u2014 on a measure legalizing the dreamers in exchange for border security \u2014 probably would be successful.  Why don\u2019t GOP leaders want this vote? Apparently because allowing these young immigrants who were brought here as children through no fault of their own to get right with the law, and work and study in America, would depress the conservative base. The Post reports that GOP leaders are delivering this stark message to the rank and file:  Signing the discharge petition and paving the way for passage of a moderate immigration bill could hurt Republicans in November\u2019s elections by depressing conservative turnout and upending leadership\u2019s plans to focus on tax cuts and other GOP successes.  The thinking appears to be that it will turn off the base if Republicans protect the dreamers with the help of Democrats without securing other draconian immigration measures, such as the wall Trump wants.  Driving this appears to be a hard-headed calculation about demographics. Ron Brownstein reports that House Republicans are basically betting their majority on a \u201cgenerational\u201d gamble:  The Republican bet is that the party can mobilize elevated turnout among their older and blue-collar white base without provoking the young and racially diverse voters who personify the emerging next America to show up on Election Day to defend it. Few things are likely to shape November\u2019s outcome more than whether that bet pays off.  Most indications are that congressional Republicans are genuinely divided on immigration, with many supporting evolution on the issue while many others either don\u2019t want to act or are in sync with Trump\u2019s views. As Brownstein notes, polls show that large majorities of older white voters agree with Trump on most issues, and because Trump is pulling the GOP in a \u201cnativist\u201d direction, this is prioritizing the views of that latter camp.  Of course, the story that recent elections have told is that Trump\u2019s racism and cruel xenophobic agenda have unleashed a massive backlash on the other side of that cultural divide, among young voters, nonwhites and college-educated non-elderly white voters, mostly suburbanites and women, swamping the GOP electorate all over the place. Indeed, it\u2019s telling that vulnerable Republicans want to take action to protect the dreamers, distancing them from Trumpism. Numerous Republicans who signed the discharge petition are in districts that are very much in play.  But Ryan and GOP leaders seem to be betting that if they can keep the aging white Trumpist base energized \u2014 while hoping that the anti-Trump backlash subsides just enough among voters on the other side of the divide \u2014 they\u2019ll barely hold their majority. So Ryan is in search of the magic solution that will protect the dreamers (giving his vulnerable members some support) while also securing the concessions that Trump wants, so he will sign the bill (preventing Trump voters from staying home).  But here\u2019s the problem: There isn\u2019t any immigration compromise that can pass Congress that Trump would sign. Trump has been adamant that he wants deep cuts to legal immigration and his mighty wall as part of any deal. The immigration proposal Trump wants got the fewest Senate votes of any of the proposals that failed earlier this year. Let\u2019s face it: The president doesn\u2019t want to take in people from \u201cshithole countries\u201c; he just screamed at his homeland security chief for failing to \u201cclose down\u201d the border; and, now, he has said at least some of the people he\u2019s deporting are \u201canimals.\u201d Does that sound like a guy who will sign a bill that can pass Congress?  As Brownstein says, the GOP majority will hinge on whether Trump can \u201csucceed in mobilizing high levels of turnout in November from those anxious voters resistant to the changing America,\u201d even as the intensity drops off among the younger, diverse, educated electorate that has driven Democratic wins up until now. As the GOP\u2019s dreamer mess shows, Republicans appear locked into that gamble.  * TRUMP IS \u2018DISTRACTED\u2019 BY LEGAL ISSUES: North Korea has threatened to scuttle the planned summit in part over John Bolton\u2019s chest-thumping, prompting mixed messages in response from the White House. The New York Times reports:  People close to the White House said the scattershot nature of the messages on North Korea reflected the newness of the president\u2019s national security team, but also the fact that Mr. Trump was distracted by the swirl of legal issues around him, from the Russia investigation to the payments made by his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen \u2026 Some suggested that Mr. Trump needed to rein in [John] Bolton.  The combination of Bolton and a distracted and easily manipulated Trump does not inspire confidence.  * ON NORTH KOREA, TRUMP PUTS SHOWMANSHIP FIRST: The Post reports that foreign policy experts worry that Trump\u2019s desire to put on a good show could make it easier for North Korea to manipulate him:  Critics fear that a president determined to declare victory where his predecessors failed will allow his desire for a legacy-making deal to override the substance of the negotiations. \u2026 Critics said Trump, enamored with his own handiwork, has focused too heavily on shaping the public narrative ahead of the summit and trying to set the stage for a political victory.  Trump will probably end up trying for a narrower deal in hopes of proclaiming it the greatest diplomatic breakthrough in human history.  * REPUBLICANS FRET ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA: David Drucker reports that Republicans are worried that Rep. Lou Barletta, the GOP Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, is blowing a big race:  The congressman is taking fire from Republicans at home and in Washington who worried that he is relying too much on the president to boost his flagging Senate bid. Barletta has been a disappointing fundraiser and been too slow to ramp up a capable statewide campaign operation, his critics charge.  Wait, so Trump\u2019s awesome popularity in Pennsylvania isn\u2019t enough to get it done? For Democrats, holding as many seats in Trump states as possible will be critical to any shot at winning the Senate.  * REPUBLICANS HOPE MUELLER GIVES THEM A BOOST: Fox News reports that Republican candidates and strategists are increasingly hoping that the Mueller probe juices the base for the midterm elections:  Candidates in some GOP primaries this year already have worked to woo Trump supporters by arguing it\u2019s time to end the Russia probe. Other Republicans are likely to follow suit amid a sense of Mueller investigation fatigue. \u201cI think you could see others embrace that messaging because the states that are up in 2018 on the Senate side are super red,\u201d one Republican strategist involved in the midterms told Fox News.  If Trump tries to shut down the investigation, of course, all these candidates will rally behind him. Remember when the tax bill was going to be the GOP\u2019s savior?  * THE DEMOCRATIC ROUTE TO A HOUSE MAJORITY: Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball offers a useful roadmap for how Democrats might win the House, mainly by winning the open seats and picking up seats in Pennsylvania, California and New York. Overall:  Some district-level indicators are a little brighter for Democrats \u2026 The playing field [has gotten] bigger. Back in February, we listed 65 GOP House seats in a competitive (non-Safe) category. We now list 86. \u2026 there\u2019s been some subtle movement toward the Democrats, but not enough to significantly alter our overall assessment of a coin flip battle for the House.  This is still anything but a lock for Democrats, but for all the talk about Trump\u2019s \u201crising\u201d approval, this analysis suggests that Democrats\u2019 chances have, if anything, improved a bit.  * DEMOCRATIC WOMEN ARE WINNING PRIMARIES: The New York Times tallies it up and finds that 60 women have won House primaries so far, and 52 of them are Democrats. But:  Of the 52 Democrats who have won their primaries, 34 are in districts that are considered solid or likely Republican seats in the general election in November \u2026 More than half of the women who have won primaries so far \u2014 33 out of 60 \u2014 will be challenging an incumbent in the fall.  So there are plenty of hurdles, but it still seems likely that a lot of new members next year will be women.  * NO, DEMOCRATS ARE NOT TOO OBSESSED WITH TRUMP: E.J. Dionne Jr. sets the record straight by pointing out that Democrats are not actually campaigning on \u201cI\u2019m not Trump,\u201d and instead are emphasizing health care and the economy:  Understanding 2018 requires accepting that the news cycle is not the same as the campaign cycle and that all elections involve a mix of mobilization and persuasion. The intense dislike of Trump means that mobilization will play an especially large role this year. But few Democrats \u2026 are counting on animosity to the president to do all their work for them.  As Dionne notes, Democrats are focused on issues to win over moderates and independents, in the knowledge that the seething anger at Trump will energize the base on its own.",

He said he was keeping his 2020 options open, considering it a real possibility. He insisted he had made no decision, and didn\u2019t need to yet, according to five people who either attended the meeting or were briefed on it by those who did.  Biden also expressed interest in bringing those in the room onto his team if he decides to launch a campaign. At the same time, he gave them an out: There would be no hard feelings if they decided they were content in their current roles outside of government, said the people, who demanded anonymity to discuss a private meeting.  The political world has long tried to game out Biden\u2019s plans for 2020. After all, he came close to running last time only to see President Donald Trump pull off a victory that many Democrats openly suggest wouldn\u2019t have happened had he, not Hillary Clinton, been their nominee. Several people came away from the meeting with the impression that if no strong Democratic candidate emerges in the next year or so, Biden would feel strongly compelled to run.  A presidential candidate twice before, Biden would be 78 on Inauguration Day if elected in 2020, a concerning prospect for some Democrats even though he\u2019s only a few years older than Trump. One possibility that Biden\u2019s longtime advisers have discussed privately is that he could announce his intention to serve only one term, clearing the path for his running mate to take over in 2024 and potentially setting up Democrats for a 12-year White House stretch.  Biden\u2019s brief discussion about his 2020 deliberations came as he brought foreign policy staffers together to set the 2018 agenda for the newly opened Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement \u2014 where many of them are now working, including Colin Kahl, his vice presidential national security adviser, and Steve Ricchetti, his former chief of staff. Eli Ratner, his former deputy national security adviser, and Mike Carpenter, the former Pentagon and State Department official who\u2019s now the center\u2019s senior director, also attended, as did Julianne Smith, a Biden adviser in the Obama administration\u2019s first term who now works at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.  A Biden spokesman declined to comment. But in a recent NBC News interview, Biden said he\u2019d decide on running in 2020 based on whether it was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m focused on one thing: electing a Democratic Congress to stop this erosion of the core of who we are,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019ll look at that a year from now. I have plenty of time to consider whether or not to run.\u201d  The meeting was one of several signs that Biden is beginning to position himself as an alternative to Trump. Biden has started denouncing the current president\u2019s leadership more frequently in public, as he crisscrosses the United States and beyond to promote his new book, his cancer initiative, his new domestic policy institute in Delaware, the diplomacy center and his new political action committee, American Possibilities.  He\u2019s also been gearing up to play a major role campaigning for Democrats seeking to retake the House and Senate in the 2018 midterms.  \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s looking out for Donald Trump. Republicans are looking out for Donald Trump. Who\u2019s looking out for everyone else? Democrats,\u201d Biden wrote in a recent fundraising pitch to the PAC\u2019s supporters. He said in 2018, he would \u201cbeat a path all across this country to stand up for leaders who will stand up for all of us.\u201d  In 2015, Biden\u2019s face was plastered across cable news channels and newspaper front pages for months as he carried out a lengthy deliberation about whether to challenge Clinton for the nomination. Ultimately, he decided he and his family weren\u2019t in position to run so soon after his son, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, died from brain cancer earlier that year. Yet many Democrats have argued that his \u201ceveryman\u201d brand and blue-collar appeal would make him particularly well-suited to challenge Trump.",

Love him or hate him, the well-known businessman and reality TV star turned American political juggernaut is emerging as a surprising voice for US national interests in the face of an ever-increasing globalized world.Below we ll examine Trump s shocking rise in American politics, his strengths, his weaknesses and what he s up against   HAWKISH DOVE    Who s the real Donald Trump? (Photo illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)The Curious Case of Donald Trump Back in 1993, brothers David and Tom Gardner founded The Motley Fool stockbroker consultancy, and at the time, it took the investment world by storm. Their mantra was simple: in business (as it is most everything else in life) timing is everything, and when a market or system becomes insular and stagnant, the conditions are ripe for a  rule breaker , and eventually, the rule breakers becomes the rule makers. This spirit of guerilla business also underpinned the Silicon Valley revolution in the 1990s and 2000s.Likewise, Donald Trump read the tea leaves and saw an opportunity in 2016.If you believe the United States is ruled by an elite establishment or is a country taken hold by statism, endless foreign intervention and crony corporatism, chances are you might be considering Donald Trump as your candidate of choice in the 2016 presidential election   and you wouldn t be alone. Similar sentiments are felt on the left-wing by supporters of Democratic Party outsider Bernie Sanders.Trump s outsider tag and anti-establishment veneer, is what seems to be resonating most among a broad base across America, as many believe that the country has been in a decline following two failed administrations in the White House under both Bush and Obama.This is the nature of populist campaigns and whether you like Trump or not, he s run one of the most effective presidential campaigns in American history, despite major backlash from the media and various political pressure groups attempting to stop his rise.The New PopulistsMuch like former Republican congressman Ron Paul in 2012, and to a lesser degree with Bernie Sanders, Trump has seemingly tapped into a cultural zeitgeist rarely seen in American politics as this year s preeminent populist choice.While Paul s staunch constitutional and libertarian beliefs propelled his popularity in 2012, it s Trump s cross-spectrum political thinking that s drawing supporters to his campaign marked by an ability to reach the average blue-collar worker, as well as successful entrepreneurs by bringing up issues concerning economic growth, immigration and global trade.To some critics however, Trump is not conservative enough, even though he s already unveiled one of the most comprehensive plans to uphold gun rights in modern history. The plan includes a proposal for nationwide concealed carry without placing a ban on certain types of guns or magazines   something which has become a hot button particularly for those on the left after a string of strange mass shooting events during much of 2015.On the other side of the political fence, many have criticized Trump s antiquated views on expanding torture techniques in the military, as well as his tough talk on internet security, privacy concerns and heavy stance on illegal immigration.The term  super-nationalistic  is being batted around to describe Trump s perspective, causing some to fear the unknown.Ironically, what has led to Trump s success has also hindered him and has arguably become a major weak point for the shrewd businessman.Trump s fiery rhetoric concerning certain issues facing America today, in some cases has worked against him, and has painted a target on him, opening the door for the media to spin anything he says, or doesn t say, or what others say about him.This is perhaps best exemplified with his tough talk on illegal immigration, along with his media counter attack against professional agitators and protesters at his events following several clashes at some of his rallies over the past few weeks.Unfortunately, his detractors and political rivals have already used these social triggers to attack the GOP frontrunner, as his Chicago rally was cancelled after erupting into a chaotic scene, leading to at least 5 arrests. Similarly, his St. Louis rally was also stormed, leading to 32 arrests, with much of the media joining in condemnation of the embattled businessman.While no one should condone the violence that results from Trump supporters clashing with outside political agitators at Trump s campaign events, critics insist that Trump has somehow escalated these volatile protests through his own incendiary language and for not using his powers of persuasion to  calm things down. Later on in this article, we ll take an even closer look at what s behind these seismic uprisings at Trump s campaign rallies.The Manhattan mogul s political story has only just begun and there are many things to consider concerning the embattled GOP frontrunner   WAR LIES    Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell and the Bush administration s findings revealed a highly coordinated disinformation campaign that led to over half a million deaths in the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003. (Photo link foreignpolicyjournal)Alternative To War?Recently, Trump was pressed again on matters concerning the Middle East and his response has been surprisingly diplomatic with a non-interventionist platform. Trump s open condemnation of the Bush administration for the Iraq war and the Obama White House for the destruction of Libya, has resonated across the board for voters on both sides of the political spectrum. Trump has asserted that 2003 s invasion in Iraq and the blitzkrieg in Libya via NATO members in 2011, is further evidence of failed US foreign policy throughout the world.Doubling down, the GOP frontrunner Trump, has also refused to pick a side between Israel and Palestine   and in true form to his business pedigree, stating that he would rather attempt to broker a peace deal in the ages old conflict, rather than tow the party line.Calling Out  Bad  Global Trade   TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP    US leaders vote in favor of cloaked trade deal involving Asia pacific countries and America in 2015. Trump has been the only presidential candidate talking about the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and its vast implications on the global economy.The Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP trade deal, is something we ve covered extensively at 21WIRE over the past two years, as international trade law for new trade treaties appear to be a way for private corporations to exempt themselves from the laws of sovereign nations under the guise of a so-called free-trade agreement.As global policy makers continue to merge with the interests of multinational or transnational corporations to achieve their goals, we could view the TTP or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as having zero national loyalty to any existing nation-state or its set of laws.These multi-national and transnational free trade deals have been vigorously opposed by Trump during many GOP debates this election cycle. Other critics of these deals have suggested they are being used as a way to gain a foothold on  property rights  in the future, in addition to having lasting implications on intellectual property.21WIRE previously outlined the role that the United States Trade  Representative has played in facilitating these deals between different industries: Understanding the power structure behind these draconian trade deals reveals the global chess play at work and the behind-the-scenes corporate merger s, under the watch of a biased government entity, the USTR. The USTR has been doing heavy lifting through its corporate connections with the likes of Haliburton (ESG and KBR) and Monsanto Corp, and  political insider  ties for a massive trade deal that will consolidate our future   all done outside of the democratic process.  This past week, Huffington Post published an article entitled  At Secretive Meeting, Tech CEOs And Top Republicans Commiserate, Plot To Stop Trump, : Billionaires, tech CEOs and top members of the Republican establishment flew to a private island resort off the coast of Georgia this weekend for the American Enterprise Institute s annual World Forum, according to sources familiar with the secretive gathering. The article goes on to say that the participants  couldn t help  discussing Trump   but he was not the sole purpose of the meeting. Here s some of the list of attendees as reported by HuffPo: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Larry Page, Napster creator and Facebook investor Sean Parker, and Tesla Motors and SpaceX honcho Elon Musk all attended. So did Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), political guru Karl Rove, House Speaker Paul Ryan, GOP Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), who recently made news by saying he  cannot support Donald Trump. Recently, it was reported by Cleveland.com that  Ohio lost 112,500 jobs in 2015 resulting from the United States  trade deficit with countries that are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. Additionally, the EPI s findings state that an estimated 2 million jobs have already been lost due to the TPP and that half of those were in manufacturing industry.Above all else, Trump s non-interventionist outlook on the Middle East and his diplomatic approach to Israel and Palestine, as well as his strong position on free trade deals such as the TPP and TTIP, have all contributed to placing the outspoken candidate on the political chopping block.Such is the curious case of Donald J. Trump   AMERICAN PSYCHO?    Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney propelled Trump s campaign despite his desperate appeal to the public last week in a staged pre-debate speech. (Photo link cowgernation)Political Attack DogsThe anti-Trump coalition consists of the Republican Party establishment, the Leftwing and the mainstream media   and each of these factions are presently at war with Trump and his campaign.From the onset, you could see the horror in TV broadcasters eyes when confronted by Trump   a media mogul himself who knows how to conduct a symphony on the airwaves. In many respects, he s their worst nightmare   a politician who can outplay them in their media manipulation game.For the American Leftwing, he induces revulsion, and for good reason   his ability to tame the media has enabled him to discard the political correctness which governs US media discourse.The most sustained attack however, is coming from his own party. In the September of 2015, here at 21WIRE, we discussed how neoconservatives within the Republican Party were incensed when Trump first launched his presidential campaign bid over the summer. Flashing forward to now, it s even more apparent that the media and the dying GOP party elite have attempted to shanghai Trump and the public during his unexpected political rise.Since last summer, there s been a host of media pundits and Washington figureheads looking to take on Trump in a kinda of metaphorical Thunderdome, something which has routinely played out before millions of TV viewers   and one by one, each has become politically castrated, spayed or otherwise cast aside by the outspoken tycoon.You don t have to take my word for it, just ask Meghan Kelley, Lindsay Graham, Jeb Bush, as well as former FOX News favorite and PNAC (Project for a New American Century) waving neocon, Marco Rubio   a list, that may now include Mitt Romney, following his dirty, scripted propaganda speech meant to quell Trump s primary rise.It seems this year more than any other, the American public has peeled away at the politically fixed halls of FOX, CNN and others, as mainstream networks have deliberately attempted to derail Trump through a plethora of designer media attacks, timely  gotcha  questions, ambush-style interviews and scripted debate forums working in concert to keep the apparent GOP outsider off-balance throughout the entire presidential nomination process.  Astute observers of the GOP nomination process, might conclude that many media personalities, political insiders and beltway lobbyists are comfortable with America s long ago chartered cruise towards global ambiguity and perpetual stagnation, rather than to take a chance on new blood.In fact, The Grand Old Party pet-parade nearly flatlined last week after enlisting Bain Capital businessman and former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney to unleash a scathing nationally televised assessment of Trump s presidential qualifications.Bain Capital, is an investment firm with a rich history of litigation concerning claims of disgruntled investors over profits, as well as a global company with big ties to military defense, aerospace and big agricultural giants like Monsanto.Romney s recent pre-GOP debate speech appeared to be a last-ditch effort directed by neoconservative strategists to silence Trump s campaign   but it led to a huge backlash and in the process, revealed the former governor s role as political spoiler (and thus damaged goods), as evidenced by his support of Bush-approved candidate John Kasich.Romney s speech, piggy-backed anti-Trump hashtag campaigns (#nevertrump and #stoptrump) that emerged in the weeks following an article by well-known neoconservative strategist, Peter Wehner on why he wouldn t support a Trump presidency.Here s a You Tube clip of Fox News contributor Judge Jeanine Pirro condemning Romney for awakening a sleeping giant  among the US electorate The Shape of ThingsMitt Romney and the billionaire boys club are out for blood.Trump is using big media to put out some  dangerous ideas    like the prospect for a peace deal between Israel and Palestine, and d tente with Russia, and also calling out the clear fraud of the Iraq War, as well as NATO s bombardment in Libya as Trump stated, Libya would be better off if we had left Gaddafi in power. If the politicians had gone to the beach instead, and did nothing, we d be better off in Libya and Iraq than we are today. Romney represents the financial and investment wing of the military industrial complex and an Israel first foreign policy. Along with John McCain, Romney is one of their  inside men  embedded inside the US political establishment.This is what Trump is really up against.It doesn t stop there, the dirty politricks continued this week as Rubio urged his supporters to vote for rival presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio John Kasich (a close Bush-family friend), with the Florida Senator stating, If you re a Republican primary voter in Ohio, and you don t want Donald Trump to be the nominee, John Kasich is your best bet. Incidentally, Jeb Bush met with  three non-Trump candidates  (Cruz, Rubio Kasich?) in Miami this week, a month after dropping out of the presidential race, due to his poor campaign results. The situation was described by the Wall Street Journal as the following: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ended his 2016 candidacy last month after months of sparring with Mr. Trump, met with each of the three non-Trump candidates this week in Miami, though he hasn t offered direction on how to block Mr. Trump s path. On another interesting note, early in March, according to The Hill, CEO of FOX News, Roger Ailes, dropped his support for Rubio, if true, the move would signify this latest strategy to use Romney and Kasich as a way to undermine Trump s campaign. Here s the excerpt reported by The Hill: We re finished with Rubio,  Roger Ailes told one of the network s hosts recently, according to three unnamed sources.  We can t do the Rubio thing anymore. Flashing forward to this past week, Trump loyalist Roger Stone, wrote a revealing article entitled  Ted Cruz, A Bush By Another Name,  which detailed GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz s close relationship to the Bush family. Here s a  passage from Stone s recent piece at The Daily Caller: Neil Bush, the son of President George H. W. Bush, who defrauded U.S. taxpayers out of $1.5 billion dollars in the savings and loan scam, and later peddled influence for the Chinese government, (who plied him with Chinese prostitutes) has formally endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for president. You can t make this stuff up. The Bush-Cruz connection is clear. Ted was George W. s brain when he ran for president. A top policy adviser, Ted maneuvered for Solicitor General in Bush World but settled for a plum at the Federal Trade Commission. Ted s a Bush man with deep ties to the political and financial establishment.  Ted and wife Heidi brag about being the first  Bush marriage    they met as Bush staffers. SEE ALSO: Ted Cruz comes up  empty  on Obamacare as government continues debt scamAs the political claws are fully out now, the recent words of Pulitzer prize nominated journo, Jon Rappoport, comes to mind: A true populist leader would accept the fact that working through usual channels, to bring about stunning changes, is a loser. The enemy is entrenched. The enemy controls the landscape. The enemy controls the machinery. Where is the populist s strength coming from? Only one place: the people who are supporting him. So he has to go back to that well, over and over again. And now he can. While pondering Trump s rivals and populism, there s a deeper agenda concerning 2016 and beyond, something which was recently pointed out here at 21WIRE.In October of 2014, The Boston Globe published a stirring article rarely seen in the mainstream entitled  Vote all you want. The secret government won t change. The Globe piece covered Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon s detailed perspective on the political process in America. The article included an in-depth discussion about Glennon s book  National Security and Double Government,  a book that gives the public an inside look into the collusion between neoconservative and neoliberal political strategy on the global stage   in particular, counterterrorism policies that are routinely followed by president after president.The idea of concealed policy between neoconservatives and neoliberals was further confirmed when Robert Kagan, a co-founder and co-author of The Project for the New American Century, recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.This was a big story, but it barely kept the media s attention span for longer than a week.Indeed, Kagan s endorsement should provide a window for people to see the so-called (neo) conservative players behind the scenes that might have helped Clinton escape the Benghazi scandal and might step in to rescue her from her ongoing national security related email case with the FBI.Clinton s exploits in Libya are well documented and her recent endorsement by neocon strategist Kagan, is just one more glaring example of political complicity, no matter who gets elected as the president of America, the foreign policy machinations are controlled by the same operators.Coincidentally or not, Kagan also appears to be linked to Romney s anti-trump plea to the public.In a catchy call to arms, a deeply biased political plea was published on the website called War On The Rocks. The piece featured an impassioned rant from those directly connected to the military industrial complex. In fact, many war party operatives, put their seal of approval on the message including Robert Kagan, as well as Former Homeland Security secretary, Michael Chertoff, (the Chertoff Group manufactured the TSA body scanners used in most major airports) as well as over hundred other political operatives.To those aware of these tactics, the War On The Rocks Trump hit-piece, read like a foreign policy business as usual dossier, with a heavy-handed characterization of mogul, while completely misrepresenting some of Washington s most notorious military interventions in recent memory.  TRUMP CARD    Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump posters adorn Trump s Nevada caucus rally. (Photo link ulinet)Socially Engineered  Flash Mobs  Go Viral The political game changers are fully after the Trump campaign now, as the George Soros funded advocacy group MoveOn, played a large role in the Chicago University student organized shutdown at the Trump rally this past Friday, as well as a host of other splinter groups associated with Black Lives Matter (BLM) and supporters for Bernie Sanders.  BLACK BLOC   Black bloc provocateurs, have violently escalated protest movements since the 1980 s, including 2011 s Occupy Wall Street Movement. (Photo link examiner)The echoes are still felt from the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and the Baltimore riots of 2015, something which immediately recalls the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement (aka OWS) in 2011, an event that turned out to be a think-tank-spun divide and conquer stratagem designed to push naive participants into violent action.  CHICAGO CHAOS    Bernie Sanders supporters join Black Lives Matter linked groups to shutdown Trump rally. (Photo link twitter)Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It s worth mentioning, that MoveOn, also supported the Obama campaign in 2008, according to the website, Sanders is the only other candidate to  threshold for an endorsement. From here on out, professional political agitator flash mobs, will be mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign   taking away Trump s strength in numbers at his rallies. This was confirmed in Ohio recently, after a BLM activist and Sanders supporter, stormed the stage, shortly after Trump started speaking.In a Politico article entitled  Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter,  we gain deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,  said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. It worth noting Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to  boost  Clinton s campaign. Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump s rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond.Any bloodshed at the hands of   vigilante mobs  at Trump rallies, should be the responsibility of those who of have sought to politicize and fund this agenda from the very beginning.Look for these political engineers, to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other at Trump s rallies or events in the future   as all of these hostile uprisings are by design.During the Days of Rage in 1969, the FBI was said to have been  tracking specific members  of the Students for a Democratic Society. The SDS was heavily connected to 60 s political agitators turned domestic terrorists, The Weather Underground. Many concluded that the group s leader, Bill Ayers, was an interloper looking for new recruits that were easily manipulated into hostile action.This begs the question: Are government agencies still infiltrating political advocacy groups to push social change?The disruptions at Trump rallies are a form of modern class warfare, one that disguises its true intentions, eroding national sovereignty through a series of upheavals, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.Amazingly through it all, Trump s still been able to confound his opposition in the aftermath of a barrage of attacks, propelling his popularity even to even higher levels.The Ides of March primaries will be a good barometer to see what impact these chaotic clashes may have on Trump s campaign moving forward.It still remains to be seen if Trump s dynamic political vision for America will push the country further into authoritarianism or whether he can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world.But one thing is for sure   there s no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unseat the GOP frontrunner and the public should question why READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",

            "body": "Editor's Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author and editor of 24 books, including, \"The Presidency of Donald J. Trump: A First Historical Assessment.\" Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nIt looks like former President Donald Trump is going to launch another bid for the White House. On Thursday, Trump told his followers to \"get ready\" for his return to the presidential campaign trail -- and top aides have been eyeing November 14 as a potential launch date, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump, it seems, is hoping to be the first person since President Grover Cleveland to win two non-consecutive elections.\n\nWhile Trump has been hinting at another run for months, the news would certainly send shockwaves through the political world. Trump is arguably one of the most controversial and destabilizing political leader in contemporary US history. And as we have seen with recent Supreme Court decisions like Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization -- as well as the toxic rhetoric and support for conspiracy theories within the GOP -- his presidency was enormously consequential.\n\nWhile there was an audible sigh of relief in many parts of the country after President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, some Democrats might feel that Trump's reemergence is good news for the party. After all, Biden, who has said it is his \"intention\" to run again, seems to have the magic formula for defeating Trump. The contrast that he automatically presents -- a stable, experienced and low-key political leader-- is powerful. Trump's presence on the campaign trail would likely also unite Democrats behind Biden and allow the President to raise significant campaign funds.\n\nBut Democrats should not underestimate the threat that Trump poses.\n\nIf the midterm campaigns have shown the Democrats anything, it is that the Republicans remain a strongly united party. Very little can shake that unity. After Trump left the White House, the party didn't change in substantive ways and the \"Never Trump\" contingent failed to emerge as a dominant force. Indeed, officials such as Congresswoman Liz Cheney were purged from the party.\n\nEven with unconventional and deeply flawed candidates such as Herschel Walker and Dr. Mehmet Oz running for key Senate seats, recent polls are showing that the GOP is in relatively good shape overall going into the midterm election on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Democrats are scrambling to defend several seats and even candidates in reliably blue states such as New York are at risk.\n\nIf Republicans do well next week, possibly retaking control of the House and Senate, members of the party will surely feel confident about amping up their culture wars and economic talking points going into 2024. And given the number of election-denying candidates in the midterms, a strong showing will likely create the tailwinds for the GOP to unite behind Trump. Although there has been copious speculation about the rise of other Trump-like Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, it's likely they will look \"liddle\" once the former President formally reenters the political arena -- as his formidable opponents learned in the 2016 Republican primaries.\n\nA GOP midterm victory would also embolden Trump himself. At this point, he has largely escaped accountability. Despite ongoing criminal investigations and the House select committee investigating January 6, Trump is still a viable political figure.\n\nAnd if Trump announces his candidacy, the Department of Justice is weighing the possibility of announcing a special counsel to oversee two sprawling federal investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of national security documents kept at Mar-a-Lago. But that's unlikely to stop Trump; we've seen his relentless attacks on former special counsel Robert Mueller, who oversaw the Russia investigation. And once Trump is formally a candidate, it will make prosecuting him all the more difficult. Trump, a master of playing the victim, is sure to claim (as he has in the past) that any investigation is simply a politically motivated \"witch hunt\" intended to take him out of the running.\n\nIf Trump avoids prosecution, he'd surely unleash a fierce assault on the President, who could very well still be struggling with a shaky economy and divisions within his own party. And if election deniers enter positions of power after the midterms, and Trump escapes any punishment for January 6, it's likely he will take advantage of the loyalists who have infiltrated state and local election offices to make sure that victory is his. Trump will also come to the race having been to this rodeo before, which will mean he can perfect the technique and rhetoric that put him into office in 2016. And now that Elon Musk has purchased Twitter, Trump could be reinstated -- giving him a way to direct and shape the media conversation once again. (Trump, who founded Truth Social, where he has been active since he was banned from Twitter, has not publicly indicated that he will return).\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that a midterm win would energize Republican voters like little else. The out-party is often more motivated and prepared for political battle than the party of the incumbent, which at some level is worn down by the realities of governance.\n\nBut the 2024 election will be as much about Biden as it will be about Trump. While Biden can tout a successful legislative record that includes the Inflation Reduction Act and the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, he will go into 2024 with the baggage that plagues any incumbent. The problems that he has struggled with, including inflation and the fallout from the withdrawal from Afghanistan, will be part of the conversation in a way that they were not four years ago. If he runs, Biden will no longer be campaigning to be the new boss -- he is the boss.\n\nThe midterms have shown that the Democrats' focus on the radical nature of the GOP and the dangers posed to democracy are not necessarily enough to rally voters. These dangers have been outlined many times over, including in Biden's closing speech Wednesday, but Democrats are nonetheless struggling to maintain power.\n\nOf course, the fact that Trump poses a very serious threat in 2024 doesn't mean he will win. Trump had turned off many independents and even some Republicans by 2020 and it remains unclear if he can win their support in crucial swing states. And as we have seen with President Barack Obama's run against Mitt Romney in 2012, presidents who have faced tough reelection campaigns can still find a path to victory.\n\n\u00a9 2022 Cable News Network.

Following are five of the most deadly and destructive hurricanes to make landfall in Florida, listed in chronological order: - Great Miami Hurricane, 1926 Miami s population had boomed in the early 1920s, and hurricanes were a strange phenomenon to new residents. When the eye of the storm came, people wandered outside in the deceptive calm. After they eye had passed, they were caught off guard by deadly winds and high waves. Outside Miami, flooding at Lake Okeechobee also caused many deaths. The storm killed at least 372 people in the state.  - Okeechobee Hurricane, 1928 It made landfall in Palm Beach County, Florida, unleashing waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters). In Palm Beach, a haven for the wealthy, some structures were flattened. The south shore of Lake Okeechobee, where migrant farm workers lived, was flooded as water topped dikes. At least 2,500 people are believed to have died from the storm in Florida, according to the National Weather Service. - Florida Keys Labor Day Hurricane, 1935 The hurricane struck the Florida Keys as a Category 5, the highest ranking possible. It killed more than 200 World War One veterans who were in the Keys to build a highway. The storm ranks as the most intense hurricane to hit the United States, based on a record low barometric pressure reading of 26.35 inches, according to the National Weather Service. It generated wind speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (322 km per hour). After ravaging the Keys, the storm moved north off the western coast of Florida before turning inland. In all, more than 400 people died in Florida.   - Hurricane Andrew, 1992 The hurricane struck South Miami-Dade County and caused an estimated $26 billion in damage. That ranked as the most expensive storm in U.S. history, until Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans and pummeled other parts of the U.S. South in 2005. More than a dozen people were directly killed by the storm in Florida, with others dying of indirect causes.  - Hurricane Wilma, 2005 While the death toll of five victims in Florida was low, compared with other hurricanes, Wilma caused more than $20 billion in property damage. It rambled across the southern part of the state, generating wind gusts of more than 100 miles per hour (161 km per hour). ",

                              "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Harvey s destruction in Texas may not have altered Florida s well-tested storm plans, but it appears to have infused residents with a new sense of urgency as they prepare for approaching Hurricane Irma. Officials said Harvey s devastating flooding, coupled with the sheer power of Irma, ranked as the strongest Atlantic storm on record, had sharpened the focus of Floridians who were somewhat indifferent about preparing for past hurricanes.  A lot of times they end up having hurricane parties here instead of evacuating,  Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said by phone.  That s been the opposite this time around.  Monroe County includes the Florida Keys, which ordered evacuations for all residents and tourists. Clark said she saw a steady stream of traffic leaving the travel destination as she drove to work early on Wednesday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts that Irma may strike southern Florida on Saturday, when it could still be a major hurricane.  As it neared Puerto Rico on Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (295 kph), Irma was a Category 5 storm, the highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity.  This storm is bigger, faster and stronger than Hurricane Andrew,  Florida Governor Rick Scott told a news conference on Wednesday, referring to one of the costliest storms in U.S. history that struck southern Miami-Dade County 25 years ago. For south Florida, Hurricane Irma  is a once-in-a-generation storm. It s the Big One for us,  Ed Rappaport, acting director of the hurricane center, told WFOR-TV in Miami on Wednesday evening.  Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez on Wednesday evening announced mandatory evacuations for most of the county s coastal cities beginning at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday. Miami-Dade has a population of 2.7 million. The evacuation orders affect more than 100,000 residents, the Miami Herald reported. Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine had already urged residents of that city on Tuesday to evacuate.  We don t want any heroes,  he said.  We want people to bring themselves to a safer place than a barrier island.  Officials across Florida said they saw signs of people taking Irma more seriously than past storms.  Residents were stocking up on water and batteries and even complaining that county leaders were not being quick enough to announce evacuations, said Don Walker, spokesman for Brevard County Emergency Management. Houston officials were criticized for not ordering an evacuation ahead of the flooding that left hundreds of people in the country s fourth-largest city trapped in their homes.  Everyone is really in tune with this storm system. My neighbors are talking about it, and we don t usually do that,  Walker said. For years, many Florida residents, joined by an ever-growing number of newcomers, paid little heed to hurricane warnings as most opted to stay in their homes, county officials said. Not this time around.  I ll tell you for the community, heck yeah, they re taking this more seriously,  said Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office, noting that many stores were out of bottled water by Monday.  They re not playing.  ",

                              "text": "(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma, a deadly, devastating force of nature, rapidly coalesced from a low-pressure blip west of Africa into one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, following an unhindered atmospheric path and fed by unusually warm seas. A combination of many factors, experts said on Friday, set the stage for Irma s formation and helped the storm achieve its full thermodynamic potential, creating the monster tropical cyclone that wreaked havoc on the eastern Caribbean and may inflict widespread damage on Florida.  It got lucky,  said John Knaff, a meteorologist and physical scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  This storm is in the Goldilocks environment for a major hurricane. It s bad luck for whoever is in its path, but that s what going on here.  Brian Kahn, an atmospheric scientist and cloud specialist for NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, called the ocean conditions that spawned Irma  absolutely ideal.  Balmy water temperatures along Irma s trajectory ran deep beneath the surface and slightly higher than normal, by as much as a degree Fahrenheit in places, providing ample fuel for the storm s development, scientists said. Irma also encountered little if any interference in the form of wind shear - sudden changes in vertical wind velocity that can blunt a storm s intensity - as it advanced at about 10 to 18 miles per hour, an ideal pace for hurricanes. Its fortuitous path of least resistance was essentially ordained by a well-placed atmospheric ridge of high pressure that steered the storm by happenstance through some of the Caribbean s warmest waters as well as an area mostly devoid of wind shear. The result was a gargantuan storm that rapidly grew to a Category 5, the top of the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength, with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, the most forceful ever documented in the open Atlantic. It also ranks as one of just five Atlantic hurricanes known to have achieved such wind speeds during the past 82 years. Irma lashed Cuba and the Bahamas as it drove toward Florida on Friday after hitting the eastern Caribbean with its tree-snapping winds, torrential rains and pounding surf, killing at least 21 people and leaving catastrophic destruction in its wake. By Friday night, Irma s winds had diminished to 155 miles per hour (250 kph) and it was downgraded to a Category 4 storm, though still considered extremely dangerous. The tiny islands directly crossed by Irma, like Barbuda and St. Martin, did little to weaken it, but the storm s intensity could be measurably diminished by a close encounter with a larger land mass, such as Cuba, en route to the U.S. mainland, scientists said. So powerful is Irma that it may end up dampening another Category 4 storm in its wake, Hurricane Jose, which like Irma originated off the west coast of Africa and was following a similar course. Waters already plied by Irma could be left a bit cooler, robbing Jose of potential energy, and  outflows  from Irma could produce wind shear for Jose, said Scott Braun, a research meteorologist for NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center. Knaff said it was no surprise that the advent of Irma coincided with the precise peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Much less certain is the role of global climate from human-induced atmospheric increases in heat-trapping  greenhouse  gases, scientists said. There is consensus that climate change has raised sea levels, which is likely to exacerbate hurricane storm surges. Rising ocean temperatures have been clearly documented as well. Research is divided on whether global warming will make tropical cyclones more frequent, though data from climate modeling suggests a higher probability for stronger, wetter hurricanes in the Atlantic when they do occur, said Tom Knutson, a climate research scientist for NOAA.  We think, based on model simulations that climate change is having an effect, making storms slightly more intense with higher rainfall rates, but these changes are not huge and we cannot yet clearly detect them in observations,  he said.

Hurricane Irma formed on the August 30 and lasted until September 16, 2017  After bringing its 20ft storm surges to the Bahamas, Irma hit parts of Cuba.  The hurricane then pummelled southern Florida with calamitous force after the storm's eyewall reached the Keys.  After spending several days with the maximum Category 5 status, Irma weakened Category 3 as it battered Cuba.  However, it again became a Category 4 storm before it reached the US coast.  The hurricane raged with winds of 185 mph and gusts of 218 mph - making it the most powerful one ever in the Atlantic.

Irma \"substantially damaged\" nearly 90 percent of government buildings and the island's electricity infrastructure, according to the International Organization for Migration.  By December 2017 The Anguilla electricity company said that it had got 87 per-cent of the electricity back up and running and expected to be at full capacity before the year was out.  The British government approved a \u00a366 million aid package for its Caribbean territories, with the majority of that money going to Anguilla to repair the ferry terminal to St. Martin and other infrastructure  Anguillan parliamentary secretary Cardigan Connor told NPR: \"Our main challenge is to get our people through the next six months.  \"Our annual budget is $200 million.

                              "text": "THE EYE OF HURRICANE IRMA (Reuters) - The sky darkened, lightning flashed and a jolt of turbulence shook the cabin of the hulking Air Force turbo-prop aircraft as it plied its way toward the eye of Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded. Piloting the four-engine, WC-130J aircraft was Air Force Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Jim Hitterman, who over the past 22 years has flown into 40 to 50 hurricanes.  Every storm is different but he likens the experience to driving through a car wash - with one big difference.  As you re driving through that car wash, a bunch of gorillas start jumping on top of your car,  Hitterman said, adding that sometimes shaking gets so bad, he cannot see his instruments.  On Friday and Saturday, Reuters accompanied the Air Force Reserves   Hurricane Hunters,  whose hard-won data taken directly from the center of storms like Hurricane Irma are critical to U.S. forecasts that save lives. Experts say U.S. satellite data simply cannot do the job.  We can estimate by satellite what the strength and size of a hurricane is. But only if you go into the hurricane can you really get an accurate measure of its exact center location, the structure, the maximum winds,  said Rick Knabb, a hurricane expert at the Weather Channel and a former director the National Hurricane Center. The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron s  Hurricane Hunters  are based at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. Its members trace the origin of hurricane hunting to a 1943 barroom dare by two then-Army Air Corps pilots to fly through a hurricane off Texas. Today, the missions are carried out largely by Air Force reservists who, after a few days or weeks of chasing storms, return to their jobs in the civilian world. Hitterman, 49, flies for Delta Airlines most of the time and, as a hobby, races motorcycles.  The flight meteorologist, Major Nicole Mitchell, is an experienced television news meteorologist and mother of an eight-month-old baby boy. She normally lives in Minnesota. The way Mitchell sees it, the more accurate her data is, the more accurate the forecasts can be that tell U.S. citizens whether to evacuate their homes as Irma or other storms advance.  It s a fact that we make a difference,  she said. Mitchell s plane would make four passes in total through Irma s eye during that mission, some entries and exits more turbulent than others. Its final pass came on Saturday, as Hurricane Irma walloped Cuba s northern coast. Irma s interaction with Cuba s terrain weakened the storm from a Category 5 to a Category 4 hurricane but U.S. National Hurricane Center warned the storm was anticipated to strengthen again.  Irma was expected to hit Florida on Sunday morning, bringing massive damage from wind and flooding to America s fourth-largest state by population. Millions of Florida residents have been ordered to evacuate. Despite the severity of storms like Irma and the undeniable danger on the ground, these U.S. flights into hurricanes have an incredible safety record - not one aircraft has been lost in more than four decades. The last time was in 1974. But they are not without risk. Some six hurricane or typhoon hunting aircraft have been lost in total, costing 53 lives, according to the Weather Underground website. Jeff Masters, director of meteorology of The Weather Underground, recalled an extremely close call during a flight into Hurricane Hugo in 1989 organized by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which also fields its own turbo-prop aircraft.  The pilot lost control of the aircraft, one of the engines caught on fire, and the aircraft descended rapidly, all because satellite data had given his crew the sense they were flying into a Category 3 storm. It turned out to be a Category 5. They were flying much too low for a storm that potent.   We went in at 1,500 feet, which is a no-no in a Category 5 and we got clobbered,  recounted Masters. The pilot was able to recover control after entering Hugo s eye. On the mission into Irma, jolts of turbulence also shook the equipment in the cabin as it neared the eye of the hurricane. Emergency parachutes swayed.  But then, suddenly, everything in the plane settled down.  It was safe enough to take off seat belts. The flying was smooth.   Inside the eye, the sky opened up. The dark  eyewall  - the surrounding ring of clouds - could be seen outside the cockpit window. Masters says someday drones might be able to do the risky job now done by experienced air crews.  But, from the cockpit of this Hurricane Hunter flight, that possibility still seems distant.  This aircraft, like all of the 53rd s 10 WC-130J planes, are     specially equipped to gather meteorological data and send it to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Some of that equipment is operated manually.  That includes releasing sensors through the belly of the aircraft that, as they fall, transmit storm data including Irma s pressure, wind speed and direction. As the mission got underway, the sensors - known as dropsondes - appeared to be malfunctioning. Technical Sergeant Karen Moore, the loadmaster who releases the dropsondes from the aircraft, among many other duties, said she could not get its GPS signal as it fell into Irma s winds. So, Moore took out a screwdriver and literally started fixing them on the fly, one by one. That is something a drone would not be able to do. Hitterman said he also could see a future where pilotless planes fly into hurricanes to get the data Americans need.   But I think it s a ways off,  he said. ",

                              "text": "\"A hurricane with winds in excess of 180 miles per hour is scary enough. But some corners of the Internet are stirring additional panic -- and attracting additional clicks -- by referring to an extreme hurricane category that doesn\u2019t even exist. The web post appeared as Hurricane Irma was powering through the Caribbean, days ahead of an expected landfall somewhere in Florida. The storm was one of the most powerful to form in the Atlantic Ocean in decades, with sustained winds as high as 185 miles per hour. Into this maelstrom came a website posing as an arm of CNN (spoiler, it\u2019s not) posting a page headlined, \"\"HURRICANE IRMA could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast.\"\" The advertising-filled page has almost no content of its own -- just an audio recording of a folksy, older-sounding woman rambling, stream-of-consciousness style, about the approach of Irma. At one point, she says, \"\"The wind speeds are way up there into the category 6 territory.\"\" A flurry of other questionable websites also played with the idea of Irma becoming a Category 6 storm. There is no such thing. The scale used by the National Hurricane Center only goes as high as 5. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale was developed by Herbert Saffir, an engineer in Coral Gables, Fla., and Robert Simpson, who headed the National Hurricane Center from 1967 to 1973. The scale used wind speeds as a guide to predict the extent of structural damage. \"\"Saffir, an engineer and expert on wind damage who helped write the Dade County, Fla., building code, developed the first version of the scale in 1971 for a United Nations report on construction that could stand up to high winds,\"\" wrote Jack Williams the founding weather editor of USA Today and co-author of Hurricane Watch: Forecasting the Deadliest Storms on Earth. As for Simpson, Williams wrote, one of his formative experiences at the National Hurricane Center came with the approach of Hurricane Camille to the Mississippi coast on Aug. 16, 1969. The storm was shaping up to be extremely dangerous, but Simpson grappled with the best way to communicate this to residents in the storm\u2019s path. \"\"Simpson broke the Weather Bureau's rule against using specific wind speed or surge figures in forecasts -- they were supposed to say things such as \u2018strong winds and dangerously high water are expected,\u2019 \"\" Williams wrote. \"\"After it was all over, despite the success of the evacuations, Simpson felt he needed a better way to communicate what a storm is capable of doing. He correlated Saffir's wind damage rankings with the surge potential to create the scale used today.\"\" While officials at the National Hurricane Center began using Simpson\u2019s new scale internally, it only began releasing it to the public in 1975, amid clamor by the media for an easily understandable metric. Officially, the Saffir-Simpson scale is based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed. \"\"Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage,\"\" according to the National Hurricane Center. \"\"Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preventative measures.\"\" The now-familiar scale of 1 to 5 breaks down as follows: Category Sustained winds (mph) Types of damage 1 74-95 Very dangerous winds will produce some damage 2 96-110 Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage 3 111-129 Devastating damage will occur 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage will occur 5 157+ Catastrophic damage will occur The scale has changed in one significant way over the years. In 2010, the federal agency removed references to storm surge from the scale after some surge expectations proved to be off-base. (Storm surge refers to how far open waters reach beyond their normal levels on coastal land.) Instead, the center directs people to more specific forecasts about storm surge. Unlike the Fujita scale for tornadoes, which runs from 0 to 5, the Saffir-Simpson scale uses measurements taken before a storm hits land. The Fujita ratings are assigned after a storm has hit and the damage is investigated. From time to time, there has been discussion of whether a new category -- Category 6 -- should be added to the scale. That decision would likely fall to the National Hurricane Center after discussions with scientists in the field, said Jill Trepanier, a hurricane specialist in the Louisiana State University department of geography and anthropology. A simple extrapolation from the existing categories would probably set the threshold for a new Category 6 around 180 mph, making Irma a good candidate for that category if it existed, said James B. Elsner, the chair of geography at Florida State University who also runs a business called Climatek that develops software for hurricane and tornado risk models. The idea of creating a Category 6 is often met with skepticism, however. The most frequently cited reason is that Category 6 would add nothing to the understanding of how destructive the storm would be for buildings and other structures. \"\"Almost no structures can withstand sustained winds over 155 mph,\"\" said Michael M. Bell, an associate professor in atmospheric science at Colorado State University. \"\"At those wind speeds, significant damage or even total destruction of most buildings is expected. By this definition, adding a Category 6 would not add any new information, since the strongest criteria for expected wind damage has already been met.\"\" Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center, agreed in an email with PolitiFact. And the scale\u2019s co-creator, Simpson, agreed as well, in a 1991 interview. Asked whether the scale should be modified to include categories above 5, he said that above 155 mph, \"\"it's going to cause rupturing damages (to buildings) that are serious no matter how well it's engineered. \u2026 That's the reason why we didn't try to go any higher than that anyway.\"\" In fact, several scientists said that a more useful change, if one had to be made, would be to focus less on wind speed specifically, either by modifying the Saffir-Simpson scale to include other factors or by giving added attention to other measurements. \"\"I personally believe that we need to work on effectively communicating the other hazards that tropical cyclones bring, including heavy rainfall and storm surge,\"\" Bell said. Hurricane Harvey, which hit coastal Texas, \"\"did cause significant wind damage as a Category 4, but much of the devastation in Houston and the surrounding areas was caused by inland flooding from sustained rainfall while Harvey was a tropical storm.\"\" Similarly, \"\"much of the damage from Hurricane Katrina was caused by storm surge when the winds were Category 3,\"\" Bell said. \"\"These multiple hazards may not be well-correlated with the Saffir-Simpson Category at landfall, and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storm's destructive potential.\"\" Trepanier said there\u2019s no reason why a Category 6 is needed to communicate how fearsome Irma is. \"\"Irma is a beast,\"\" she said. \"\"It is safe to say the wind speeds are rare, but I see no benefit in calling it a Category 6. It should be considered catastrophic. And that is how people should refer to it.\"\" So, as of now, there is no such thing as a Category 6 storm. The web post suggesting that Irma is one rates .\"",

Winds exceeding 124 mph were recorded as the super storm made landfall, as it was upgraded to a category five storm.  Met Office Cyclone Gita is approaching Tonga and is set to cause devastation  Where is the storm now?  Cyclone Gita continued to intensify as it howled towards Vanuatu after hitting Fiji on February 14.  Meteorologists said the cyclone gathered pace as it moved westward out to sea and by early Wednesday reached top-of-the-scale Category Five.  But it is now expected to weaken as it skirts southeast of New Caledonia and dissipates over New Zealand next week.  The storm carved a path of destruction through American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga since late last week.  Gita caused power outages after tearing through the island nation of Tonga just south of the capital, Nuku'alofa, with winds exceeding 124 mph at landfall.  Some 5,000 people stayed in evacuation centres overnight, according to officials, and an emergency was declared.  There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or deaths.  The storm strengthened since hitting Samoa and American Samoa last week, where it caused damage to buildings, widespread power outages and flooding.  President Donald Trump on Sunday declared an emergency in American Samoa, a US territory.  AFP Samoa Red Cross workers checking on a house in the Apia area on a flooded street after Cyclone Gita wreaked havoc on the island  Is it a hurricane?  Tropical cyclones are hurricanes, but the term cyclones is used to describe both hurricanes and typoons due to the system of clouds and thunderstorms that come with them.  One a tropical cyclone reaches maximum winds of 74 miles per hour or higher is it classed as a hurricane, typhoon or tropical cyclone, depending on where the storm originated in the world.  In the North Atlantic, central North Pacific, and eastern North Pacific, the term hurricane is used.  The same type of disturbance in the Northwest Pacific is called a typhoon.  But, in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, the generic term tropical cyclone is used, regardless of the strength of the wind associated with the weather system.  The eye of Tropical Cyclone #Gita is currently passing very close to the Tongan islands of #Tongatapu and 'Eua. It is equivalent to a category 4 hurricane, bringing strong winds, storm surge and torrential rain. pic.twitter.com/UZ94aFzaPm \u2014 Met Office Storms (@metofficestorms) February 12, 2018  MOST READ IN WORLD NEWS \u2018I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING\u2019 Thai suicide Brit, 68, 'ran up \u00a3100k debt' after marrying 'hooker' BRUTAL DEATH Horrific moment man is mauled after 'trying to take selfie with BEAR' FINAL farewell Brit prof, 104, says goodbye to grandson as he flies to euthanasia clinic \u2018GROW UP ELON\u2019 Tesla loses \u00a31.5bn after Musk refuses to answer \u2018bonehead questions\u2019 in call UTTER CRUELTY Smirking tourist steals a LIVE dolphin from a beach and puts it in his car TRAGIC BROTHERS Grand Canyon helicopter crash victim mistaken for brother due to 100% burns  How will Cyclone Gita affect UK weather?

                              "text": "MIAMI/TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Walter Hodgdon scrapped plans to ride out Hurricane Irma on Saturday when shifting forecast models suddenly put his home on a barrier island on Florida s Gulf Coast directly in its path. Within hours, Hodgdon and his partner had hastily boarded up their home and were driving to North Carolina, having the time to store just a few valuable glasswares in an inner closet.   Last night, during one of the models, they drew a line right over our house,  said Hodgdon, 58, who lives on Terra Ceia where Tampa Bay meets the Gulf of Mexico.  We figured if we are going to leave, we are going to leave completely.  Hodgdon and his partner, Nels Gullerud, were among the scores of people living on Florida s west coast forced to make last-minute decisions about whether to hunker down - or flee - amid one of the fiercest Atlantic storms in a century.  Storm models that earlier in the week projected Irma to bear most heavily on eastern Florida now had the storm barreling right up the western coastline, menacing population hubs around Tampa and Fort Myers.  People haven t known exactly what to do, because the situation changes every 12 hours,  said Adam Gray, pastor of Redeeming Church in St. Petersburg, Florida, who two days ago week talked to relatives on the east coast about staying with him. Now his wife and young child had evacuated, while he stayed behind to help church members board up their houses and locate spare rooms on higher ground. He planned to open the church to those unable to find shelter. Others in Irma s path decided to take their chances. As surrounding neighborhoods evacuated, Andrea Prather of Fort Myers stocked up on bottled water and food to ride out the storm with her boyfriend and her cat. The 51-year-old pop singer felt safe on the 25th floor of a high-rise built to withstand hurricane-force winds. Still, as the most recent hurricane models showed the storm heading her way, her jitters flared.   When it made that turn, that s when I had that anxiety pit in my stomach,  she said.  How can anyone be totally prepared?  Michael Albrecht, a communications professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, decided to stay at his parents  fourth-floor condo in South Pasadena, near the Gulf of Mexico.  He decided he would be safer in the concrete building with aluminum storm shutters, high above any storm surge, than at his own one-story house in nearby Gulfport, on a street prone to flooding and surrounded by tall trees that could fall down.  No branches can hit you up here on the fourth floor,  said Albrecht, 40.  I m worried about what if it s a week without air conditioning and electricity. That ll be inconvenient but not life-threatening.  But after a week of making and changing evacuation plans, Dionna Duncan, 48, on Saturday morning simply opted to leave her home in Palm Harbor, Florida. She had been working all week, without time to prepare. Plywood and other supplies were sold out. She could only put out a few sandbags. She remembered to take 200-year-old family pictures. But she left hanging in her closet the wedding veil that her daughters had wanted to wear someday.  You just forget, because you are in such a hurry,  said Duncan, who works in the insurance industry and had for years made detailed disaster plans.  When you are staring something like this in the face, it doesn t matter what your experience is. Most of your knowledge just escapes you.  Retiree Ann Pinsker, 71, and her husband chose to evacuate from their Fort Lauderdale condo on Florida s east coast on Thursday when they thought the storm was headed that way. After a 3-1/2-hour drive stretched into 9-1/2 hours, they now fear the storm is headed directly at the hotel where they are staying in Lakeland, in the central part of the state.  With Fort Lauderdale now predicted to be spared the brunt of the storm, their neighbors are sending them photographs from a  hurricane party  they are holding in the building.  I wish we were there,  Pinsker said.  But hindsight is 20-20.   ",

It's bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to some areas hit by Hurricane Ian less than two months ago.\n\nFollow live updates >>\n\nNicole's colossal path has led to the closures of many schools, colleges and universities as well as the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the shuttering of amusement parks. Additionally, some residents evacuated their homes after they were deemed unsafe and at risk of collapse due to the storm's impact.\n\nIn Volusia County, officials told people to leave more than 20 buildings found to be structurally unsound due to Ian's impact in late September.\n\n\"There is a strong potential that one or more buildings will collapse during the storm,\" Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told CNN affiliate WESH-TV on Wednesday. \"Right now, ground zero is here.\"\n\nNicole, which also threatens to whip up tornadoes, is expected to weaken to a depression early Friday and become a post-tropical cyclone over the Southeast.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Nicole brought strong winds and dangerous storm surge to the northwestern Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center in the US said.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nTens of thousands without power: More than 80,000 homes and businesses were without power early Thursday after the storm made landfall in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us. A tropical storm warning is in effect from Boca Raton to the Flagler-Volusia County Line in Florida. Up to 8 inches of rain can drench eastern, central and northern portions of Florida. Plus, between 2 to 6 inches are expected from parts of the US southeast to the southern and central Appalachians and western mid-Atlantic through Friday, the hurricane center said.\n\nHistoric hurricane: Nicole's landfall Thursday was historic because it became the latest in a calendar year a hurricane has ever struck Florida's Atlantic coast. The storm's landfall broke a previous record set by the Yankee Hurricane, which hit Florida's east coast on November 4, 1935.\n\nResidents urged to evacuate unsafe buildings: Ahead of Nicole's landfall, officials asked people to evacuate some buildings deemed unsafe to withstand the storm. In New Smyrna Beach, officials determined some condos are unsound due to the erosion of a sea wall. And in Daytona Beach Shores, which is still reeling from Hurricane Ian's impact, at least 11 buildings are at risk of collapse, according to Public Safety Department Director Michael Fowler.\n\nSchool closures and flight cancellations: Many school districts, colleges and universities have closed as the storm approaches, according to the Florida Department of Education. Orlando International Airport halted operations Wednesday afternoon, and Miami International Airport said cancellations are possible, but it does not plan on closing.\n\nSouth Carolina residents should prepare: People across the state should prepare for the likelihood that Nicole could bring heavy rain and winds. \"Given the uncertainty of the storm's strength and path as it approaches South Carolina, residents need to have their personal emergency plans ready to go just in case we need to take safety precautions later in the week,\" said Kim Stenson, who heads the state's emergency management division.\n\n\u00a9 2022 Cable News Network.

Here's why some can cost up to $600 (\u00a3490 or AU$800) -- and how to make expensive-tasting coffee on a budget. by Sharon Profis Close Drag \nSo you broke your coffee maker. It happens. After all, they're usually made of fragile glass or ceramic. They're bound to break sooner or later. \nSo how do you continue to make coffee while you wait for your new one to arrive? The easy answer is, don't . Just hit the nearest Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru. \nThat said, if you've grown accustomed to a morning coffee-making ritual like many coffee enthusiasts, you would rather go without before forking over $4 for some batch-brewed coffee. \nLearn how to make great coffee in a pinch, even when not all of your equipment is in working order. Materials \nWhat you will need to make coffee hasn't changed. You still need a carafe, or something to make the coffee in. You also still need coffee grounds and a way to filter them out of the brewed coffee. And you will definitely still need hot water. Taylor Martin/CNET \nOne of the best substitutes for a typical pour-over coffee maker, such as the classic Chemex, is a two-quart mason jar. \nFor filters, just about any standard coffee filter will do. Chances are, if you had a coffee maker and it broke, you probably already have some filters on hand. If not, however, you can also use thin, unbleached cotton fabric, like muslin. \nIf you use thin cotton fabric as a filter, make sure you sterilize it before using it. Bring some water to a boil in a deep sauce pan and soak the fabric in it for approximately 5 minutes. Remove the fabric from the pan and discard the water. Making coffee without a coffee maker \nTo make coffee in a mason jar, first heat around two cups of water. The ideal temperature for brewing coffee is between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit (90.6 to 96.1 Celsius). \nIf you're using a paper filter, fold the seams of the filter so that it will open up more easily. Insert the filter into the mason jar and fold the edges of the filter over the mouth of the jar. Screw the band (the round threaded part, without the center lid) onto the mouth of the jar. Pour a small amount of hot water through the filter to help remove some of the paper taste from the filter. \nRemove the band and filter from the jar and pour out the water. Taylor Martin/CNET Taylor Martin/CNET \nReinsert the filter into the jar and screw the band on once more. Grind approximately 1 ounce (30 grams) of coffee medium fine. If you're using a cloth filter, you may want to grind the coffee a bit more coarsely. \nPour the coffee grounds into the filter, then pour approximately 0.25 cup (60 milliliters) of water over the grounds. Gently stir the water into the grounds and let sit for 30 seconds. \nNext, slowly pour the remainder of the water over the coffee, making sure not to overflow the filter. \nOnce the water has drained through of the filter, carefully remove the band from the jar and discard the filter with the grounds into the trash. The entire jar will be very hot to the touch, so you may need to use a cloth trivet or oven mitt to hold the jar still while you remove the band. \nPour the coffee into a mug and enjoy! \nWhile this method likely won't make the best cup of coffee you've ever had, it does make a surprisingly enjoyable cup of coffee. This method can also serve as a way to make coffee while camping, traveling or in a number of different scenarios. Some day, it may even make you a true coffee hero. Share your voice ",
