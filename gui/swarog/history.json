                              "text": "With up to 90 cm of snow and temperatures as low as minus 10.3 Celsius in Scotland, Britain and Ireland issued their most severe red warnings which advise people to stay at home as travel is too dangerous. Dozens of people were trapped in their cars on the M80 motorway between Glasgow and Edinburgh, with several hundred having been standed on the road overnight. Flights and trains were canceled across both Britain and Ireland - with similar transport problems in continental Europe. More freezing snowy weather was forecast as Storm Emma approaches from Portugal and France, with warnings of treacherous weather across southern England and Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said people should remain indoors from 1600 GMT on Thursday until the storm, with winds forecast to reach 100 kph (60 mph), has passed. \u201cThe risk to life and limb presented by the severe weather conditions should not be underestimated by anyone,\u201d he said following a meeting of the National Emergency Coordination Group. \u201cIt is not safe to be outside in such conditions.\u201d  All flights will cease from Dublin airport by 1600 GMT and the two carriers that use the airport, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, said they do not plan to fly from the airport at all on Friday. Trains and planes were canceled across Britain and Ireland. Emergency services also struggled on what many consider to be the first day of the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s Spring. One doctor told Reuters that staff were snowed in at a hospital near Glasgow, and another doctor told the BBC of a surgeon colleague who walked almost three hours in the snow to the town of Paisley to perform a cancer operation. Wholesale gas prices soared to their highest in at least 10 years on Thursday and the British power network regular, the National Grid, warned of a deficit in the market and sought to buy gas from market players to unblock bottlenecks. The cold spell, dubbed the \u201cthe Beast from the East\u201d, has been caused by a jump in temperatures high over the Arctic which has weakened the jet stream that brings warm air in from the Atlantic to Ireland and Britain. Britain\u2019s two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, both said that flights would be canceled. Police in Lincolnshire, eastern England, said that all roads were impassable. Britain\u2019s Met Office warned that freezing rain was likely across southern England as Storm Emma pushes northwards from Portugal and France, adding that it looked set to be the coldest spell in Britain since 1991. In Scotland, there were widespread road closures and no trains running on the two main lines to and from England. Police were rescuing stranding motorists, and found a vulnerable man in what they described as \u201clife threatening weather conditions\u201d. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports were closed. Some places in southern Scotland were under such heavy of snow, it affected funeral services in Hawick, near the border with England. \u201cThe issue for digging the grave is getting into the burial ground, and we\u2019ve had about 3 feet (90 cm) of snow here,\u201d Ross Walsh of Robson\u2019s Funeral Directors told Reuters. Ireland was bracing for the biggest snow fall since 1982 with public transport halted and schools across the republic closed. The Irish stock market said it would close from midday on Thursday and remain closed all day Friday. In Switzerland, Geneva airport closed for several hours and dozens of flights were canceled. Snow also disrupted road and rail traffic. France had its share of snow too, even on the beaches of the Riviera coast in the southeast. The worst was in the south where hundreds of cars and trucks were stranded on the A9 motorway, a strip that links southern France and Spain. The airport in Montpelier was closed for a period overnight but partially reopened on Thursday. Upwards of 15,000 homes along the Mediterranean were without power on Thursday morning, power network company Enedis said. It also snowed across much of northern Italy overnight, bringing fresh disruption to a rail network already hard hit by heavy snow across the south at the start of the week. Schools in Florence were ordered to shut, while heavy goods vehicles were banned from the roads in the north. In the Netherlands, strong winds caused problems. At Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport, only two of the six landing strips could be used on Thursday morning. Authorities had to close sea barriers south of Rotterdam to protect shipping.",

The only one of its kind in service today, the program\u2019s progress is yet another example of the Kremlin's active push to expand its presence in the increasingly strategic Arctic region, but the concept could find use in various roles elsewhere, as well.

The Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk on the White Sea in northern Russia had first laid down the barge in 2007, before transferring it to the Baltic Shipyard the following year. The vessel will first test its reactors by the end of 2018 and it will enter formal service in Pevek in Russia\u2019s Far East region in 2019, according to a press release from the shipyard. The Russian government plans to buy at least seven of these power barges in total.  When it becomes operational, the nearly 500-foot long Lomonosov will have a displacement of around 21,500 tons. Inside the warehouse-like superstructure is more or less a typical nuclear power plant, with a reactor complex, control facilities, and the necessary equipment to generate electricity and safely transfer it ashore. There\u2019s a helipad on top to help ferry technicians to and from their jobs onboard.  Each Lomonosov-class vessel will have two KLT-40S pressurized water reactors, a derivative of the standard KLT-40 and improved KLT-40M, the latter of which powers Russia\u2019s Taymyr-class icebreakers. Each S variant can produce up to 35 megawatts of electricity or 150 megawatts of thermal energy.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. Tugs maneuver Akademik Lomonosov as it begins its voyage in Saint Petersburg.  According to the press release from the Baltic Shipyard marking the departure from Saint Petersburg, the thousands of miles long voyage to Murmansk will be relatively slow going. At the very best, the four tugs belonging to Russia\u2019s Federal Agency for Maritime and River Transport, or Rosmorrechflot, will be able to move the power plant at around four knots, or just over four and a half miles an hour.  But the lumbering Lomonosov is significant in a number of ways. Most importantly, it represents the first of a class of floating nuclear power plants, which is also known as the Project 20870, that engineers designed from the very beginning to be mass produced. The first nuclear power ship, the Army\u2019s MH-1A Sturgis, which provided power in the Panama Canal Zone between 1968 and 1975, was a conversion of an existing World War II-era Liberty ship.  As such, Russia has suggested that if this type proves successful that it could export it to other nations with significant populations situated along coastal areas. As of 2008, the Russian state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom claimed that China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Algeria, Namibia, Cape Verde, and Argentina had all expressed an interested in the Project 20870 vessel or similar designs.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. A cutaway showing the basic configuration of Akademik Lomonosov.  For the Russian government specifically, the ships will significantly allow it to significantly expand its activities in the Far North and Arctic regions, which can often be isolated from communities further south for months at a time. As a result, it can be difficult to support fossil-fuel powered power stations in these areas, as it requires the prepositioning of large quantities of coal, oil, or natural gas.  At the same time, shifting permafrost and other terrain features, as well the generally harsh climates, can often make it difficult to quickly and safely erect complex structures, such as nuclear power plants, to support even civilian communities near or above the Arctic Circle. A mobile, floating power station helps get around these issues.  In Pevek, Lomonosov will be able to quickly replace the Soviet-era Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant and the Chaunskaya coal-fired power plant. Of the other six planned Project 20870 floating power stations, five are already set to help Russia\u2019s state-run oil and gas company Gazprom expand its off-shore activities in and around the Arctic region. The last one could go to Dudinka on the Taymyr Peninsula or Vilyuchinsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, both also in the country\u2019s far north.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. Another view of the Akademik Lomonosov.  If the concept proves sound, though, it seems likely that the Kremlin could look to expand the number of floating nuclear power plants, either of Project 20870 type or separate designs, to support additional efforts in the Arctic region, including supporting new or rehabbed military facilities. Starting in 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to refurbish various abandoned sites in the area, as well as build entirely new air, ground, and naval bases. This decision was part of a generally more assertive Russian force policy that had already become apparent with the illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region earlier that year.  In April 2017, Russian officials unveiled one of the first of its all-new Arctic sites, called the Arctkicheski Trilistnik, which translates variously as Arctic Trefoil or Arctic Shamrock, which sits on Alexandra Land, an island in the Franz Josef archipelago, and is north of the Arctic Circle. It is unclear whether this base\u2019s own power plant, which helps it remain self-sufficient during the winter months when it is largely cut off from the mainland, is conventional or nuclear.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. A mobile radar system sits in front of the main building of then still under construction Arctkicheski Trilistnik in 2015.  On top of that, the Kremlin has reportedly already been expanding its military use of nuclear power, including developing smaller underwater nuclear power stations as part of expanding undersea sensors networks in the Arctic region. This makes sense if Russian officials are looking to better monitor foreign submarine movements and otherwise secure territorial claims in the area.  Floating nuclear power plants such as Lomonosov could similarly help provide the critical power for permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary stations in remote areas, on ice floes, or even on the water\u2019s surface over protracted periods of time. Typical portable generators using fossil fuels might be enough to sustain basic life support in these locations, but could require a significant and regular logistical pipeline and wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to run power-hungry sensor or weapon systems. With more robust bases with these types of assets, the Russians would be better positioned to actually limit foreign military activities, especially in a crisis, rather than just monitor them.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. A landing ship assigned to Russia's Northern Fleet deployed a tank on a snow-covered beach during a training exercise.  That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t potential limits to or concerns about the fleet of nuclear power barges. As noted, these floating platforms are not particularly easy to move and once in place, they may essentially take on the role of a fixed power plant. With tugs only able to move them at a top speed of four knots, it could take an immense amount of time and effort to bring them back to Murmansk or Saint Petersburg for any necessary heavy maintenance, as well.  The plan for the Lomonosov with its 70-megawatt output to fully replace the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant, with its top generating capacity of 48-megawatts, as well as the Chaunskaya generating plant might be optimistic, as well. It would no doubt require the ship to run regularly and without incident in order to provide that steady stream of power to the communities in and around Pevek.  And while Russian authorities insist that the KLT-40S reactor design is both proven and reliable, it is based on a decade's old design. In 2011, the icebreaker Taymyr suffered a coolant leak on one of its KLT-40Ms that resulted in a release of radiation into the atmosphere in spite of various redundancies and other safety features found on that already updated design.  Combining it with a floating platform in a region where weather can quickly turn extreme has long prompted concerns about the potential for a major radiological incident and environment disaster, as well. Russia claims that the Lomonosov is sufficiently hardened against a variety of natural disasters and accidents, reportedly being strong enough to even brush off a small plane crashing into it.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. A diagram showing the basic components of the KLT-40S reactor.  And regardless of whether the base KLT-40 design is safe in principle, there are questions about whether or not Russia\u2019s nuclear industry is capable of the necessary quality control and routine maintenance to keep it that way or will have adequate funding to do so. Just in the past 18 months, there have been reports of unexplained increases in radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere originating from Russia, with experts saying the most likely culprits are poorly maintained nuclear power plants and waste facilities.  Still, the Project 20870 program, along with Russia\u2019s other military and civil investments in the Arctic region, show that the country is serious about expanding its presence there. Doing so can only help the country gain improved access to various natural resources and trade routes, as well as deny the same, as well as freedom of military movement in a crisis, to its potential opponents.  The Kremlin isn\u2019t alone in identifying the growing importance of the region, either. China, among others, is now reportedly increasing its own activities and investments in the Arctic, presenting another challenge to the United States its regional partners, such as Canada, Japan, and South Korea. The Chinese government expects to commission its first domestically produced ice-capable research ship, the Xuelong 2 or Snow Dragon 2, in 2019.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. China's Xue Long icebreaker.  \u201cU.S. presence in the Arctic is necessary for more than just power projection; it\u2019s a matter of national security,\u201d U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft, who\u2019s service controls the U.S. government\u2019s only two remaining icebreakers, told legislators during a hearing in May 2017. \u201cIf they remain unchecked, the Russians will extend their sphere of influence to over five million square miles of Arctic ice and water.\u201d  If the Project 20870 program proves workable to any serious degree, it might kickstart a renaissance of sorts for power ships and float nuclear power plants, which could have broad applications in coastal areas. As already noted, Rosatom has indicated that the Lomonosov could be an attractive design for any country that is looking to rapidly expand reliable power in coastal regions. Depending on how robust the power grid might be, it might even be possible to use the floating power station to provide electricity much further inland, as well.  This sort of capability could easily have a wide variety of applications in any remote littoral area, such as the Pacific Ocean, it might be otherwise difficult to rapidly establish the necessary prime power during sustained, but distributed military operations or in the aftermath of a natural disaster. For military forces especially, being able to deploy a high-capability, but relatively mobile power plant might just be increasingly necessary given the growing electricity demands of advanced sensor systems and other equipment, and even potentially certain future weapon systems such as land-based railguns.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. Akademik Lomonosov under construction.  In addition, concepts such as the Lomonosov could serve as a stepping stone to the development of even smaller, more portable nuclear reactors to support military operations. These units would also be even better suited to rapid deployment as part of a humanitarian relief mission.  \"Maybe one of the most tragic events in recent history with the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico. 3.5 million Americans who are without electricity. We're trying to get micro generators down there. We're trying to get fuel down there,\" U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said during a panel discussion in September 2017. \"Wouldn't it make abundant good sense if we had small modular reactors that literally you could put in the back of a C-17 aircraft, transport to an area like Puerto Rico push it out the back end, crank it up, plug it in that could serve tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people very quickly?\"  As with the MH-1A floating nuclear power plant, this wouldn't be the first time the U.S. government has explored this concept. During the 1960s, the Army experimented with an air-transportable nuclear reactor called the ML-1, which was small enough that its two main parts could each fit on the back of a tractor-trailer truck or a rail car. The U.S. Air Force also employed small nuclear reactors during the Cold War to power remote radar stations and a similar, containerized design supported U.S. government research work for a time at McMurdo Station in Antarctica.  In the aftermath of Hurricane Iwa in 1982 in Hawaii, the U.S. Navy investigated whether it might be possible to power storm-damaged areas by linking a nuclear submarine to the local power grid. It's an idea that reappeared on internet forums and comments sections after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico.  Unfortunately, these ideas have so far not proven to be practical options. ML-1 was exceptionally expensive and proved unsuitable for use on a wide scale. It hasn't appeared to be any more cost-effective to use nuclear warships as temporary power stations.  Experts are also skeptical about whether miniature reactors such as ML-1 could be any cheaper to produce now and suggest that any practical mobile designs that a company could mass produce would still be closer in size to the one on Lomonosov or other ships. The safety and security requirements of deploying numerous small reactors could easily add to the overall costs and make the concept of dubious value in the end.  It remains to be seen how rapidly the Russians can build the remaining six planned Project 20870 power plants and how capable they actually are in practice, for operations in the Arctic or anywhere else. If nothing else, Lomonosov\u2019s trip to Murmansk makes it clear that the Russians are moving ahead to expanding that influence in the Arctic to the full extent that they can, especially as additional competitors, such as China, are making their own inroads in the region.

                              "text": "Louis Fernandez walks along a flooded Collins Avenue in Miami Beach in September 2015. Lynne Sladky/AP  On Monday morning, the Trump administration revealed its long-awaited infrastructure plan, which aims to funnel $1.5 trillion toward fixing the nation's roads, bridges, airports, and more over the next decade.  However, the 55-page plan ignores the key thing that would save the US billions in infrastructure every year: resilience in the face of climate change.  Stephanie Gidigbi, a policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the plan \"misguided.\"  \"The Trump administration's misguided infrastructure plan ignores the threats facing our country from stronger storms, higher temperatures, and bigger floods,\" she told Business Insider. \"Smart investments in our future would help make our communities more resilient to withstand the effects of climate change, and would recognize the opportunities in cleaner energy.\"  Though it's hard to say exactly how much climate change-linked infrastructure damages costs the US, a 2017 study estimates that rising temperatures are increasing maintenance and construction costs for roads by billions of dollars every year.  That's because asphalt is sensitive to temperature. If it gets too cold, it can crack; and if it gets too hot, it can partially melt. Temperature can determine the construction method, too. Asphalt blends that are more resilient to hot summers often cost more, but they are also less prone to damages.  In 2010, temperature changes added anywhere from $13.6 billion to $14.5 billion in annual pavement costs, according to the study. That figure could increase to $19 billion in 2040 and $21.8 billion in 2070. Under a more extreme prediction, warmer temperatures could contribute $26.3 billion and $35.8 billion in annual costs by 2040 and 2070 respectively.  These forecasts do not account for road impacts from flooding and storm surges, which would make cost figures even higher.  \"Because these transportation systems constitute large civil investments ($7.7 trillion in assets and $45 billion annual expenditures) and underpin an economic vibrancy [3.1 trillion miles] of public travel per year and private citizen expenditures equal to 8.9% of GDP), the impacts [of climate change] may be substantial,\" the researchers wrote.  Trump's plan is a departure from how infrastructure is usually funded. As BI's Bob Bryan notes, the federal government typically covers the majority of the cost, but under Trump's plan, local governments would take on 80% or more of the financial burden. Local governments are already largely responsible for repairs after major storms and other weather events. The City of New York, for example, plans to spend $20 billion on damages from Hurricane Sandy.  \"This proposal doesn't begin to respond to the scale of assistance local communities need to cope with these mounting impacts \u2014 it merely shifts the burden of rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure onto state and local budgets which are already strapped,\" Ken Kimmell, president of the science advocacy nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.  One section of the plan says the White House hopes to expedite the environmental review process for new infrastructure projects by requiring a firm deadline of 21 months. Under current law, projects require analyses that anticipate environmental impacts, some of which take years. Democrats have expressed uncertainty link? about cutting down this regulatory red tape. They say that shrinking the approval time for reviews could make it easier for project sponsors to dodge environmental regulations.  The plan builds on the Trump administration's promise to roll back legislation that addresses climate change, including the Clean Power Plan, Paris Agreement, and Clean Water Act. In 2017, the US government revoked a plan to require higher flood standards for highways and bridges as well.  Kimmel notes the infrastructure plan also doesn't mention renewable energy, the modern electric grid, resilience, or adaptation.  \"This is a plan to shore up the infrastructure of the past, rather than invest in what we need for the future,\" he said.",

                              "text": "PARIS \u2014 A blast of Siberian weather sent temperatures plunging across much of Europe on Tuesday, causing headaches for travelers and leading to several deaths from exposure as snow carpeted palm-lined Mediterranean beaches.    The icy weather is in stark contrast to conditions in the Arctic itself, which is experiencing an \u201coff-the-charts\u201d heat wave this week, according to the European Geosciences Institute.    Meteorologists have documented temperatures above freezing in some parts of the Arctic, causing astonishment among many scientists.    But to the south swathes of Europe were shivering under temperatures well below freezing, claiming at least 10 lives across the continent in a snap dubbed \u201cthe Beast from the East\u201d by British tabloids.    At least five deaths were reported in Poland alone on Monday as the mercury dropped to minus 16 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit) overnight in Warsaw.    That brought the number of Polish deaths from freezing to 53 since November 1, and temperatures are expected to remain below minus 12 Celsius across the country Tuesday, with the cold accentuated by a biting wind.    In Lithuania, temperatures dropped to as low as minus 26 degrees Celsius overnight, and one suspected death of a man from freezing was reported in the capital Vilnius.    In Britain, authorities warned of five to 10 centimeters (2-4 inches) of snow on Tuesday and the likelihood of travel delays on roads, rail networks and at airports, while electricity and even mobile phone service may be cut in some areas.    On Monday, British Airways cancelled more than 60 short-haul flights either departing or arriving from London Heathrow airport.    Some of the iciest conditions were reported in Italy, where many schools and daycare centers were closed, to the consternation of parents already preparing for closures next week linked to this weekend\u2019s general election.    Public anger was also growing over the disruptions to rail services across the country, as travellers learned that many track switches did not have defrosting equipment, meaning they had to be dug out by hand.    In Naples, the airport was closed early Tuesday and bus services in the city halted because of ice.    And a driver in Turin got a fright when a stalactite broke off from an overhead bridge and shattered his windshield \u2014 though he managed to keep control of his vehicle.    One of the coldest points overnight was at Glattalp in Switzerland, where the temperature fell to -38 Celsius \u2014 extreme even for the high-altitude area (1,850 meters), according to the ATS news agency.    In France, which has remained frigid but dry during the cold snap, forecasters warned of heavy snow across much of the country starting Wednesday -- though spring-like temperatures would soon follow.    On Tuesday, residents of Ajaccio on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica woke up to some 15 centimeters of snow on the beach, something not seen since 1986.    At least three people have died during the cold snap in France.    Across the continent, authorities have been opening emergency shelters and increasing relief efforts for the homeless.    The mayor of Etterbeek in Belgium said those sleeping rough would be forcibly detained if they refused to go to shelters, citing the \u201cmajor risk\u201d from exposure to the cold.    In Berlin, rising fears for homeless people led officials to open an additional 100 beds, with the city\u2019s shelters, now with a total of 1,200 beds, more than 90 percent full, RBB public radio reported. \u2014 AFP",

The Met Office is predicting snowfall for parts of the country despite the UK being well into spring. Here's the latest info on whether the snow is heading in your direction.  Northpix A snowplough on the ski road at Cairngorm mountain on Good Friday  What's the latest weather forecast?  A cold front is moving in from the Atlantic causing a wintry blast.  Snow is now predicted to hit Scotland and northern England this weekend.  By 9am on April 29, Scotland will have seen a sprinkling of the white stuff after it moves down from the north coast.  The Met Office wrote on its website: \"The heavy rain will be accompanied by strong to gale force northerly winds and it may be cold enough to produce some snow on high ground although this seems unlikely to settle.\"  By the next day, snow is predicted to hit the North Pennines and the Chilterns in northern England and southern Scotland.  And by Monday temperatures will drop far enough for snow to fall on high ground over the North and South Downs.  The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Eastern and Southeastern England for heavy rain and flooding on April 29.  Meteorologists are forecasting downpours of up to 70mm in places accompanied by strong to gale force Northerly winds, while homes and businesses have been put on guard for risk of flooding.  Met Office spokesman John West told The Sun Online: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very wet and quite windy.  \u201cCaused by this low pressure springing out of northern France and is sucking in could air from places like Scandinavia. It\u2019s going to be a wintry mix.\u201d  Weather Outlook director and forecaster Brian Glaze said: \u201cMonday which is looking very cold and wet in large parts of the country and there could even be some wet snow.\u201d  He added: \u201cMonday will be unseasonably cold with temperatures in wet parts of the south and east possibly not getting above 5C.  \"Wet snow possible over high ground in England. Also a risk of gale force winds in the east, along the east coast of England gusts of up to 60mph.\u201dmet  The Met Office have warned flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and road closures.  What are the coldest UK winters on record?  Despite snow regularly blanketing the country, modern winters are nothing in comparison to those of the so-called \u201clittle ice-age\u201d which lasted from 1350 until 1850.  These arctic winters resulted in the River Thames freezing solid for months on end.  The worst UK winter on record is way back in 1683-84 and was dubbed the \"Great Frost\".  The Thames was covered in 11 inches of thick ice resulting in the famous Frost Fair \u2014 a festival held on the frozen river involving ice-skating, gambling and bear-baiting.  London News Pictures A canal in Little Venice in west London froze over amid sub-zero temperatures in early 2018  The winter of 1739-40 is one of the worst on record with a severe frost, which saw temperatures plummet to -9C, starting on Christmas Day and lasting until February 17th.  The only time the River Thames has frozen in modern times was in the so-called \u201cBig Freeze\u201d of 1963 which saw the country covered in a thick blanket of snow.  Sheffield was one of the worst hit with four feet of the white stuff.  Another modern \"snowmaggeddon\" occurred during December 1978 and the early months of 1979.  Against a backdrop of political instability in the UK, the winter was the worst since 1963.  more weather news OH SNOW NOT AGAIN Weather warnings as almost 3 INCHES of rain, gales and SNOW expected SNEEZY DOES IT What is a pollen bomb and does it make hay fever symptoms worse?

A bitterly cold wind smashed the country at the end of November 1978 bringing blizzards and snow showers.  The worst winter of the new century was in December 2010 which broke national records and covered Britain in ice and snow.  Once again dubbed the \u201cBig Freeze\u201d, the average temperature for the month, which was -1C, was the coldest for 100 years, the Met Office confirmed.",

                              "text": "Super Bowl Weather  The Minnesota Climatology Office has put together a page showing climatology facts for February 4th in the Twin Cities - the date of Super Bowl LII. Here's what they say about snow depth and amount of sunshine in early February:  \"In reality, the weather for the first week of February can vary greatly. At times, it can be the coldest part of the winter and \"sporting\" some of the deepest snow depths. The chances of seeing no snow cover occurs in about 1 in 10 years. Having a snow depth of about six inches happens about half the time and having at least a foot of snow on the ground is about 15% of the time. It is also the time of year that the length of day light becomes noticeably longer. By February 4, there is about one hour and fifteen minutes of extra daylight since December 21. On February 4, 2018 the sun will rise at 7:29 am and set at 5:25pm, Central Standard Time in the Twin Cities.\"  The Southeast Regional Climate Center also has a fact sheet on past weather for all Super Bowls. According to their data, the coldest high for a dome game was 16 back in 1982 (played at the Silverdome in Pontiac, MI). The coldest high for a non-dome game was 43 back in 1972 (played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, LA).  It looks like we will see the coldest Super Bowl on record Sunday here in the Twin Cities, as highs only climb into the single digits. Wind chills will remain below zero all day.  _______________________________________________  January Recap  The Twin Cities ended the month above average in the temperature, precipitation and snowfall departments. We ended the month one degree above average, with an average temperature of 16.6\u00b0. The 20.4\" of snow we saw means that January 2018 will go down tied for the 11th snowiest January on record in the Twin Cities.  _______________________________________________  _______________________________________________  Phil Prognosticates Today - 1-2\" Of Snow Saturday  By DJ Kayser, filling in for Douglas  Today is the day each year when we supposedly hand over the long-term forecast over to a lone groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil. Early this morning he\u2019ll crawl (okay, more like be taken) out of his hole in Pennsylvania to tell us whether there\u2019s six more weeks of winter or if spring will arrive early. Since Phil started predicting in 1887, he has seen his shadow a whopping 103 times - meaning he\u2019s predicted a continuation of winter 79% of the time (including the ten years that there are no records for).  I don't have to see my shadow to accurately predict that winter will continue across the state over the next week. Highs will be in the single digits and teens with sporadic snow chances. The best snow opportunity at the moment looks to arrive Saturday, bringing a fluffy 1-2\u201d across southern Minnesota.  Sunday could easily be the coldest Super Bowl on record - dome or no-dome - with highs in the upper single digits. Any chance we can move \"LII\" outdoors, so that Philadelphia and New England fans can get a real taste of winter in Minnesota?  _______________________________________________  Extended Twin Cities Forecast  FRIDAY: Scattered PM snowflakes.

Highs will remain in the single digits across northern Minnesota. We will be watching the chance of some light snow showers, mainly during the afternoon to overnight hours.  Even though highs will be warmer on Friday, they will still be 5 to 15 degrees below average for this time of year across most of the state.  Warmer weather (teens above zero for highs) will continue through Saturday before another blast of cooler air works in in time for Super Bowl Sunday. We'll moderate back into the teens for highs then as we head into next week.  While a few light snow showers will be possible across the state Friday, a better chance of snow works in Saturday across southern Minnesota, where a band of 1-2\" of fluffy snow will be possible.  We'll then continue to watch a few sporadic chances of light snow in the forecast as we head through next week here in the Twin Cities as clipper systems pass through or near the region.  _______________________________________________  National Weather Forecast  A few showers will be possible across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, with snow showers across the Northeast, Friday (especially in the morning hours) as the cold front that has been pushing east continues to move further offshore. Lake effect snow will be in progress across parts of the Great Lakes throughout the day before another burst of snow moves across the upper Midwest and Great Lakes by the evening and overnight hours. Rain and higher elevation snow will continue across the Northwest.  Cooler than average weather is expected Friday across most of the eastern U.S. behind a cold front that moved through the region. In some areas, highs will be up to 20 degrees below average. Warmer weather will continue out west, where parts of the Southwest will be up to 15 degrees above average.  The heaviest precipitation over the next five days (through Tuesday morning) will be across the Northwest, where 2-4\"+ of liquid precipitation is possible. Across the southern and eastern U.S., another frontal system will move through during the weekend and into early next week, bringing more rain (and northern snow) to the region.  Feet of snow will be possible at the higher elevations in the Northwest through Saturday evening as numerous systems continue to move through the region. Snow of a foot or more will also be possible due to lake effect snow in prone areas downwind of the Great Lakes.  _______________________________________________  Gulf Of Alaska Earthquake - January 23rd  The USGS has released more information on the January 23rd earthquake in the Gulf of Alaska: \"One week ago, on January 23rd at 12:31 a.m. local time, Alaskans were rocked by a magnitude 7.9 earthquake, with an epicenter in the Gulf of Alaska, about 350 miles southwest of Anchorage, and about 175 miles southeast of Kodiak Island. Four minutes later, Alaskans in coastal communities were awakened with blaring alarms when NOAA\u2019s National Tsunami Warning Center sent out a Tsunami Warning for the state and the west coast of Canada based on the quake\u2019s magnitude and its proximity to the coast. At the same time, a Tsunami Watch was issued for California, Oregon, and Washington. Ultimately, a small tsunami surge, less than one foot deep, was observed in Kodiak and smaller water-level increases occurred in other Alaskan coastal communities. A water-level rise of a few inches was detected four and a half hours later in Arena Cove, California. Three hours after the initial tsunami advisory was issued, NOAA canceled it.\"  Winter And Insects  How do insects survive in winter? The Midwest Regional Climate Center takes a look: \"Midwestern winters are too cold and long for most insects to survive without special adaptations or strategies. In cold northern latitudes, insects will either 1) migrate south to spend the winter months in warmer climates (e.g. monarch butterfly) or 2) overwinter locally. Overwintering insects enter a state of inactivity known as diapause; think hibernation for insects. In this state, an insect\u2019s metabolic rate drops, growth stops, and stored body fat is used to survive the winter. Insects can diapause as adults, larvae, pupae, or eggs depending on the species. Some insects are \u2018freeze tolerant\u2019 and can keep their bodies from freezing by producing alcohols that act as antifreeze. However, most insects in the Midwest choose to avoid freezing and may even seek shelter inside our homes.\" (Image: Asian multicolored lady beetles invade home during the winter.

More from Earther: \"Young Colombians are taking the government to court over the environment. The 25 plaintiffs, whose ages range from 7 to 26, filed a lawsuit in Bogota Monday demanding a right to a healthy environment free of deforestation and the irreversible impacts from climate change. The suit calls explicitly for the federal government to create an action plan to reduce the Amazon\u2019s rapid deforestation by 2020. (That\u2019s also what President Juan Manuel Santos promised during the 2015 Paris Climate Summit.)\" (Photo: AP)  New York Expanding Offshore Wind Energy  The governor of New York believes that wind energy will be a $6 billion industry by 2028, and wants to build new turbines offshore in the upcoming years. More from WSHU: \"With the release of its master plan for offshore wind energy, New York State is doubling down on its commitment to renewable energy at a time when the Trump administration is moving to allow coastal drilling for oil and gas. The plan calls for hundreds of turbines to be built on a one million acre site in the Atlantic Ocean at least 21 miles south of the Great South Bay, ensuring that none of the turbines would be visible from the shoreline. Estimates say that the windfarms would generate 2,400 megawatts of power by the year 2030 \u2013 enough to power more than a million homes.\" (Image: MATT YOUNG / AP)",

Snow brought travel chaos to Devon where this crash happened on the A30  What is the latest UK weather forecast?  After days of snow showers, Brits are braced for a day of sunny spells, with some areas set to see light patches of rain that will clear before the end of Tuesday.  It will be a icy commute, and a yellow ice warning remains in place across many parts of England and Wales.  Snow melt from Monday's sunny spells and overnight showers have increased the risk of ice on untreated surfaces.  Brisk winds will develop in the north, and will be pretty noticeable across eastern England, where showers will appear.  A car is left abandoned in a snow drift in Thwaite, North Yorkshire  Across the west, temperatures will be slightly colder, with lows of 2C in Exeter before midday, and highs of 4C around eastern regions including London and Hull.  On Sunday, wintry weather caused major disruptions as Brits were told to stay off the roads in southern parts of the country.  Dangerously cold temperatures of around -8C and around 12 inches of snow left locals in Devon forced to take shelter in a nearby school.    Have schools been closed due to snow in the UK?

In December, 2017, Britain's worst snowstorm in four years led to nearly 3,000 schools shutting out of concern for staff and children's welfare.  Storm Caroline left an Arctic air flow in its wake, with temperatures plunging across the UK and up to four inches of snow heavily obstructing roads.  Schools which shut included more than 500 in the east of England and more than 200 each in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire.  Birmingham was the worst hit city with around 400 schools closing.

                              "text": "President Trump arrives on Marine One yesterday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)  With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve.  THE BIG IDEA: President Trump sometimes seems impervious to the second and third order consequences of his decisions.  Several recent developments have highlighted the unintended \u2014 though often foreseeable \u2014 consequences the president\u2019s policies are having on his own supporters.  In many cases, he\u2019s following through on campaign promises \u2014 like cutting the flow of immigrants, renegotiating trade deals and rolling back regulations put in place by Barack Obama. But in the deeply interconnected global economy, the devil is always in the details and the implementation of some policies may do more to hurt than help the people who put their faith in him to fix their problems.  Here are four examples:  -- Small business owners who voted for Trump might be forced to shut down because the president is making it harder for them to hire guest workers. Here\u2019s a story that appeared over the weekend in the Herald Leader of Lexington, Ky.:  \u201cEddie Devine voted for [Trump] because he thought he would be good for American business. Now, he says, the Trump administration\u2019s restrictions on seasonal foreign labor may put him out of business. \u2018I feel like I\u2019ve been tricked by the devil,\u2019 said Devine, owner of \u2026 Devine Creations Landscaping. \u2018I feel so stupid.\u2019 Devine says it has been years since he could find enough dependable, drug-free American workers for his $12-an-hour jobs mowing and tending landscapes for cemeteries, shopping centers and apartment complexes across Central Kentucky. So for years he has hired 20 seasonal workers, mostly from Guatemala, through the U.S. Labor Department\u2019s H2-B \u2018guest worker\u2019 program. Importing these workers for a few months cost him an additional $18,000 in fees and expenses beyond their wages, which must be the same as he pays American workers. But that\u2019s the only way he could serve his customers.  \u201cRestrictions on guest-worker visas, which began during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term as immigration became a hot issue for conservatives, have gotten worse under Trump. And it\u2019s even more of a problem now that the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in years. Devine says he lost a $100,000 account because he didn\u2019t have enough men to do the job. \u2026  \u201cHe isn\u2019t alone. Cuts in H-2B visas are hurting small businesses across the country that can\u2019t find Americans willing to do hard, manual labor: Maryland crab processors, Texas shrimp fishermen, and Kentucky landscapers and construction companies. Devine said he believed Trump\u2019s America-first promises. But cutting off a good supply of seasonal foreign labor when Americans won\u2019t take those jobs is only hurting American business owners and the U.S. workers they employ, he said. These workers aren\u2019t immigrants, and there is no path to U.S. citizenship. When their seasonal work is done, they return home. That\u2019s why Devine thinks the Trump administration\u2019s stifling of guest-worker programs has more to do with racism than economics. \u2018I think there\u2019s a war on brown people,\u2019 he said.  \u201cBut what makes him most angry is that Trump\u2019s properties in Florida and New York have used 144 H-2B workers since 2016. \u2018I want to know why it\u2019s OK for him to get his workers, but supporters like me don\u2019t get theirs,\u2019 Devine said.\u201d  Association of Global Automakers President and CEO John Bozzella, left, and Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Hackett, right, arrive for a meeting with President Trump at the White House. (Susan Walsh/AP)  -- General Motors is cutting its second shift at the Lordstown Assembly plant outside of Youngtown, Ohio, next month. The move could cost 1,500 jobs at the 3,000-employee plant that builds the Chevrolet Cruze. This is in the heart of the Mahoning Valley, long a Democratic stronghold that broke toward Trump in 2016 because of his popularity with the kinds of blue-collar workers who are about to lose their jobs or reluctantly take buyouts.  GM says it\u2019s downsizing because there is \u201clower customer demand for compact cars.\u201d The plant already downsized last year, moving from three shifts to two, partly because consumers are buying more crossovers, SUVs and trucks at the expense of smaller vehicles.  Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who represents the plant, blames reduced demand, and the pending layoffs, on Trump\u2019s decision to scrap fuel efficiency standards \u2014 which the auto companies did not want. \u201cWhile low gas prices paved the way for the decline of compact cars \u2026 Trump\u2019s April announcement to weaken fuel economy standards put his thumb on the scale in favor of the larger cars and SUV\u2019s made elsewhere, hurting our community specifically,\u201d the congressman said in a statement last Friday. \u201cThe truth is, the fuel economy standards help sell more Chevy Cruzes.\u201d  President Trump speaks at an event in North Charleston, S.C., last year to celebrate the construction of the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)  -- Ironically, gas prices might go up because Trump pulled out of the Iranian nuclear agreement last week. (Iran is the world\u2019s fifth-biggest oil producer.)  -- The president\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran deal, and reimpose sanctions, will cost Boeing contracts worth as much as $20 billion to replenish Iran\u2019s aging fleet of commercial planes. The Chicago-based aerospace giant downplayed the impact last week, noting that there\u2019s already a backlog of orders for 737 aircraft so production won\u2019t slow. But $20 billion in planes represents quite a lot of manufacturing work.  Those jobs will now go to other countries \u2014 specifically Russia. \u201cRussian aircraft makers, who can skirt the U.S. sanctions, are already working on deals,\u201d the Puget Sound Business Journal reports. \u201cA Russian aircraft maker is exploring plans to make a modified version of its Sukhoi Superjet 100 regional airliner so Iranian airlines can buy the jet.\u201d  -- The trade war with China is increasing uncertainty for farmers and may still lead to punishing retaliatory tariffs.  China buys 60 percent of all U.S. soybean exports, and growers of the crop could be pressed hard if the administration cannot cut a deal with Beijing. Soybean-producing counties went for Trump by a margin of more than 12 percent in 2016.  Dave Walton, who voted for Trump and tends soybeans, corn and livestock in eastern Iowa, is not sure his farm could take the added stress. \u201cIf this turns into a longer-term thing, we\u2019re going to see friends and neighbors go out of business,\u201d he told Caitlin Dewey last month. \u201cIf this stretches into years, we ourselves won\u2019t be able to sustain it.\u201d  Walton\u2019s 800-acre farm, in his family for 118 years, has already been struggling to stay above water with falling crop prices, and tariffs could make profitability difficult. \u201cRight now, soybean growers in Iowa and across the nation are encouraging the administration to engage positively with China,\u201d he said. And if that doesn\u2019t happen, he added: \u201cIowa leads the nation in many things. The presidential election is one of them.\u201d  Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.  Sign up to receive the newsletter.  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:  Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) leaves the Civil Courts building Monday in St. Louis after prosecutors abruptly dropped a felony invasion-of-privacy charge alleging he took a revealing photo of a woman with whom he has acknowledged having an affair. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/AP)  -- \u201cSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner dropped her prosecution of Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) in the face of the defense team\u2019s plan to call her as a witness,\u201d the Kansas City Star reports. \u201cYet Republican legislative leaders said later that evening that Gardner's decision would have no impact whatsoever on whether the Missouri General Assembly moves forward with impeachment, a process set to begin at 6:30 p.m. Friday. GOP leaders also renewed their call for Greitens to resign immediately. Gardner\u2019s office asked the court to appoint a special prosecutor to refile the felony charge of invasion of privacy against the governor \u2026 Gardner's decision to drop the case came after more than 100 potential jurors had been interviewed for the trial that was set to begin this week. \u2026 Scott Rosenblum, a member of Greitens' team, said the judge's decision was based on the probability that Gardner had knowledge of perjury committed by a private investigator hired by her office.\u201d  Greitens declared victory outside the courthouse: \u201cThis experience has been humbling, and I have emerged from it a changed man.\u201d  But, but, but: House Speaker Todd Richardson (R) said his chamber\u2019s investigation of the onetime GOP rising star, who had presidential ambitions until the scandal broke, has uncovered \u201cadditional concerns relating to the governor\u2019s conduct.\u201d  Even if he survives impeachment, the governor has mounting legal problems: \u201cIn addition to the invasion-of-privacy charge, Greitens also was indicted on felony computer tampering last month over allegations he illegally obtained and used a donor list belonging to a veterans charity to raise money for his 2016 campaign,\u201d the Star reports. \u201cIn a related accusation, the attorney general's office thinks Greitens knowingly filed false campaign finance disclosure reports to the Missouri Ethics Commission, a Class A misdemeanor. A lawsuit in Cole County accuses the governor and his staff of using a self-destructing text message app to circumvent the state\u2019s open records law. And Washington University and the John Templeton Foundation are investigating whether Greitens violated an agreement by allegedly using an academic grant to pay his political staff as he was planning his campaign for governor.\u201d  GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b  The Supreme Court struck down a federal law forbidding states from authorizing betting on college and professional sports. The decision is likely to trigger a scramble among states to legalize and tax sports betting \u2014 a billion-dollar business that some predict will change spectator sports. (Robert Barnes) SCOTUS also ruled a lawyer cannot disclose his client\u2019s guilt without the defendant\u2019s consent. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in the 6-to-3 decision that such a decision rests solely with the accused, even if admitting guilt would be a good legal strategy. The ruling will allow Robert L. McCoy, who was convicted of murdering three members of his estranged wife\u2019s family, to receive a new trial. (Robert Barnes) Melania Trump underwent a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to treat a benign kidney condition. An aide to the first lady said her surgery \u2014 which was vaguely described as an \u201cembolization procedure\u201d \u2014 was successful, and she is expected to remain hospitalized for the rest of the week.

(Jake May/Flint Journal-MLive.com/AP)  WATCH WHAT THEY DO, NOT WHAT THEY SAY:  -- The White House and Scott Pruitt's EPA intervened to block the publication of a federal health study on a nationwide water-contamination crisis, after a White House official warned that its release would trigger a \u201cpublic relations nightmare.\u201d Politico\u2019s Annie Snider reports on emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act: \u201cThe intervention early this year \u2014 not previously disclosed \u2014 came as HHS' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry was preparing to publish its assessment of a class of toxic chemicals that has contaminated water supplies near military bases, chemical plants and other sites from New York to Michigan to West Virginia. The study would show that the chemicals endanger human health at a far lower level than EPA has previously called safe ... \u2018The public, media, and Congressional reaction to these numbers is going to be huge,\u2019 [an unidentified White House] aide said in an email [to OMB's James Herz, who oversees environmental issues] ... The email added: \u2018The impact to EPA and [the Defense Department] is going to be extremely painful.\u2019 ... More than three months later, the draft study remains unpublished, and the HHS unit says it has no scheduled date to release it for public comment.\u201d  -- Meanwhile, the White House recently canceled a NASA program aimed at monitoring levels of carbon dioxide and methane. (Science)  Israeli troops fire tear-gas and live ammunition on Palestinian protesters near the border with Israel. (Hathiam Imad/European Pressphoto Agency/Shutterstock)  THE NEW WORLD ORDER:  -- Israeli forces killed 59 Palestinians and injured at least 2,700 others during yesterday's protests along the Gaza border as the new U.S. Embassy opened in Jerusalem. The violence marked the territory's bloodiest day since the Israel-Gaza conflict in 2014. Loveday Morris and Hazem Balousha report: \u201cTens of thousands of Palestinians had gathered on the edges of the fenced off blockaded territory from midmorning. Many came to peacefully demonstrate, bringing their children, carrying flags. Food stalls sold snacks and music blared. But the protests appeared to have a more violent edge \u2026 At [one gathering point], organizers urged protesters over loudspeakers to burst through the fence, telling them Israeli soldiers were fleeing their positions, even as they were reinforcing them. Israeli snipers were determined not to allow a breach, and ambulances soon began screaming back and forth from the fence, as gunshots rang out over the crowd. No Israeli soldiers were injured, though, and Israel drew widespread condemnation for an excessive use of force.\u201d  -- The Trump administration refused to admonish Israel and sought to blame Hamas solely for the violence. John Hudson reports: \u201c'The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas,' [deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah said]. 'Israel has the right to defend itself.' During the White House briefing, a reporter noted that Israeli snipers have killed people who were throwing rocks 50 meters from the wall. Shah responded by saying, \u2018Again, we believe that Hamas is responsible for this.\u2019 Later Monday at the State Department, [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo was asked about the violence. The top diplomat turned his back and walked away.\u201d But Monday's violence drew swift condemnation from the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, which described the killings as a \u201cbloodbath.\u201d  Ivanka Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speak during the opening ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. (Abir Sultan/European Pressphoto Agency/Shutterstock)  -- As tear gas and live ammunition rained down on Gaza protesters, a very different scene was unfolding in Jerusalem \u2014 where members of a high-level presidential delegation, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, gathered to celebrate the opening of embassy. Ruth Eglash reports: \u201cAmid the happy bustle of about 800 guests, as [Kushner] spoke, the controversial evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress blessed the occasion \u2026 there was little indication of what was unfolding [in Gaza]. In his video address Monday, Trump said that he was still hopeful for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, despite almost universal criticism of the embassy move from some of the United States\u2019s closest allies in Europe, from Arab nations and from the Palestinians.\u201d  -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced his country will recall its ambassadors to the United States and Israel in protest of the embassy relocation, saying the move proves the United States prefers \u201cto become part of the problem rather than the solution.\u201d \u201cWith this last step \u2026 the United States has lost its role as mediator in the Middle East peace process,\u201d Erdogan said. South Africa also plans to pull its envoys from Israel. (CNN)  -- This story should be getting a lot more attention: The surprisingly strong performance of a ticket backed by Moqtada al-Sadr in the Iraqi elections will rattle U.S. relations with the country. Tamer El-Ghobashy and Mustafa Salim report from Baghdad: \u201cSadr is a ferocious critic of American policies in the Middle East, and his unexpected electoral haul immediately calls into question the continuing presence of U.S. troops in Iraq. ... Sadr\u2019s ticket won the most seats in Iraq\u2019s parliamentary election, according to results from all 18 provinces released Monday, placing him in the best position to select the country\u2019s next prime minister and set the course for how the nation emerges from a costly war against the Islamic State. His ascendancy comes at the expense of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, the preferred candidate of the United States, who came in third.\u201d  How he's rebranded himself: \u201cThe Shiite cleric first gained international notice as a young militia leader who fought U.S. troops after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. But Sadr has grown increasingly pragmatic over the years and formed a cross-sectarian electoral alliance emphasizing Iraqi nationalism over loyalty to Iranian clerics and American military and political backing.\u201d He's presented himself as a technocrat.  How he won: Sadr's base was ginned up in an election that saw very low turnout. He campaigned as a change agent promising to fight corruption and reform the patronage system. This helped his ticket fare better than expected in some provinces.  A silver lining: The Iranians also distrust this guy. They see him as too independent, and he\u2019s pushed back when Tehran tried to dictate the agenda for Shiite politicians. And his spokesman sounded a conciliatory tone toward Washington yesterday: An aide said Sadr supports honoring commitments between Iraq and the United States concerning the training of Iraq\u2019s security forces and weapons purchases as long as they serve Iraq\u2019s interests and there \u201cis no interference on the sovereignty of Iraq.\u201d  Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and President Trump speak at the G-20 meeting in Hamburg. (John MacDougall/AFP/Getty)  -- America\u2019s three closest European allies \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 are still fuming over Trump\u2019s decision to exit the Iran deal, which has triggered a frenzy of meetings and phone calls between leaders as they weigh how \u2014 or if \u2014 to respond. Karen DeYoung reports: \u201cThe Europeans have not yet decided how far they are willing to go in antagonizing Trump. On Wednesday, government heads of all 28 E.U. countries will gather in Sofia, Bulgaria, where they will talk about the Iran agreement and their separate beef with the United States over looming steel and aluminum tariffs. But they are hesitant to deepen the wound, even as they want the United States to take responsibility for healing it. \u2018It\u2019s vital that we continue to engage with the USA and continue to interrogate our friends in Washington,\u2019 [Boris] Johnson said, to find out how the administration intends to achieve what Trump says he wants \u2014 a new deal with Iran[.] So far, the officials say, they have no idea how the administration plans to accomplish that. \u2018We haven\u2019t heard anything that is close to a strategy,\u2019 said one of several European officials.\u201d  -- Trump\u2019s tweet about Chinese telecoms giant ZTE threw trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials into chaos. Damian Paletta, David J. Lynch and Josh Dawsey report: \u201c[Chinese Vice Premier Liu He] and other Chinese officials have demanded that the Commerce Department ease restrictions on ZTE, but until Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet, the administration had resisted. \u2026 After Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet, White House officials spent much of the next 24 hours attempting to walk back his statement, saying ZTE\u2019s fate would ultimately be left up to a review by [Commerce Secretary Wilbur] Ross. And Monday afternoon, Ross insisted in a speech at the National Press Club that ZTE would not be a factor in the trade talks, saying, \u2018Our position has been that that\u2019s an enforcement action separate from trade.\u2019 Just three hours later, Trump tweeted again, contradicting Ross\u2019s statement that the issues would be kept apart.\u201d  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker shakes hands with Vice President Pence at the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  THE MIDTERMS:  -- Amid the chaos, infighting and converging investigations that have roiled Trump\u2019s White House, Mike Pence has quietly moved to expand his influence within the GOP \u2014 even when his own political agenda doesn\u2019t align with his boss. The New York Times\u2019s Alexander Burns, Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cEven as he laces his public remarks with praise for the president, Mr. Pence and [chief of staff Nick Ayers] are unsettling a group of Mr. Trump\u2019s fierce loyalists who fear they are forging a separate power base. \u2026 In addition to addressing dozens of party events in recent months, Mr. Pence has effectively made himself the frontman for America First Policies, an outside group set up to back Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. And Mr. Pence has worked insistently to shape Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsements, prodding him in the contests for governor of Florida and speaker of the House, among others. For now, Mr. Pence and his aides have found a yawning opening within the West Wing, as Mr. Trump\u2019s principal political aides spend much of their time managing his impulses \u2026 instead of overseeing the party[.]\u201d  -- During a meeting in which Trump told Brad Parscale that he would manage his 2020 reelection bid, the Times reports that Pence \u201cstood behind Mr. Parscale, rubbing his shoulders, as Mr. Trump spoke.\u201d (New York Magazine compiled a list of 17 times Pence praised Trump\u2019s shoulders on the campaign trail.)  -- But Trump has repeatedly sought to undercut Pence\u2019s influence \u2014 sometimes by attending the same events. Politico\u2019s Matthew Nussbaum reports: \u201cTrump wasn\u2019t planning to attend the recent National Rifle Association convention \u2014 that is, until he learned that [Pence] would be giving the keynote address. That led to a change of plans in the West Wing, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, and nearly a week after the NRA announced Pence would speak, the president was added to the schedule to speak moments after Pence. \u2026 And Trump is elbowing Pence out in other, smaller, ways: on Tuesday, the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List announced Trump would be headlining its annual Washington gala this year, after Pence gave the keynote address last year. \u2026 [And] on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s first campaign manager and frequent adviser Corey Lewandowski announced he\u2019ll be joining Pence\u2019s own political action committee, Great America.\u201d  -- In another illustration of how the politics of immigration have changed on the right, Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who is running for Jeff Flake\u2019s open Senate seat \u2014 has dropped her support for immigration legislation that offers \u201cdreamers\u201d a pathway to citizenship. McSally is instead backing a less-generous alternative that calls for a sharp reduction in legal immigration, sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). McSally\u2019s political shift is part of an effort to fend off a primary challenge from Joe Arpaio, the anti-immigrant county sheriff who Trump pardoned last year after he was held in contempt of court for ignoring a judge's order to stop racially profiling Hispanics. (Arizona Republic)  -- Today is the Pennsylvania primary. \u201cPennsylvania was [Trump\u2019s] proudest conquest in 2016, a state no Republican had won in a presidential election for nearly three decades and a victory he is still talking about,\u201d David Weigel reports. \u201cBut in both suburbs and rural areas this year, Democrats are mounting a comeback with implications not only for November\u2019s midterm elections, but the 2020 presidential race \u2014 just as soon as they settle Tuesday\u2019s messy primaries. The contests, the first based on a congressional map drawn by the state\u2019s Supreme Court, are a collection of rowdy ideological battles between Democrats running on universal Medicare, a $15 minimum wage, and whether to make college free or just cheaper. Democrats see the state as the launchpad for their party\u2019s comeback. Few states in this cycle offer so many additional pickup opportunities. For Democrats, that means competitive primaries all over the state.\u201d  -- Former congressman Tim Murphy (R-Penn.) has been working to sink the primary bid of Rick Saccone, who lost a separate congressional bid to Rep. Conor Lamb (D) in March. From Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade: \u201c[Saccone] is now running for the GOP nomination in a newly drawn, heavily Republican district that includes much of Murphy\u2019s old turf. The fight has gotten personal: Murphy has directed hundreds of thousands of dollars from his old campaign account to an outside group supporting Saccone\u2019s GOP primary opponent, state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler. Murphy also sent around a cropped video clip of Saccone that he believed would damage him. At one point, Murphy accidentally forwarded that link to Saccone while trying to send it to someone else. The inadvertent exchange about opioids triggered a nasty back-and-forth that ended with Murphy calling Saccone \u2018heartless,\u2019 while Saccone argued that his comments were taken out of context.\u201d  -- Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) accused Nancy Pelosi of \u201ctrivializing\u201d the issue of Trump\u2019s impeachment, which the House minority leader has described as a \u201cgift\u201d to Republicans for the midterms. \u201cPresident [Trump] can be impeached, and should be impeached, for his hateful, hurtful and bigoted policies,\u201d Green said ... \u201cTrivializing his bigotry also allows Trump supporters to hypothesize that while Trump may be an objectionable jerk, he is not an impeachable bigot, which is not true.\u201d (David Weigel)  -- Michael Scherer and Kevin Uhrmacher made a graphic on what influential Democrats have said about running for president in 2020.  Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Rick Perry huddle in the lobby of Trump Tower on Dec. 12, 2016. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)  THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:  -- Andrii Artemenko, a Ukrainian politician who communicated with Trump associates regarding a controversial peace plan between the Kremlin and Ukranian rebels, has been called to testify before Robert Mueller\u2019s grand jury. Politico\u2019s David Stern and Josh Meyer report: \u201c[Artemenko] said he assumed he would be asked about the peace plan, about which he communicated with Michael Cohen \u2026 in early 2017. [The Times] reported in February 2017 that Artemenko had contacted Felix Sater \u2026 to find out how he could make his plan for peace in Ukraine known to the Trump administration. Sater introduced Artemenko to Cohen, who left the plan in the office of [Michael Flynn]. \u2026 Artemenko\u2019s testimony could help Mueller\u2019s team fill in the gaps on the peace plan, which he has been investigating in part because of the roles of Cohen and Sater, who also worked together to try and launch a Trump-branded development in Moscow \u2026 The plan may also be of interest to Mueller because it reportedly was hatched shortly after Flynn discussed dropping sanctions against Russia in a call with the Russian ambassador \u2026\u201d  -- Michael Avenatti\u2019s take-no-prisoners media strategy could imperil his ability to represent Stormy Daniels. Emma Brown and Beth Reinhard report: \u201cScrutiny of his business record and of his motives has provided grist for distracting headlines in recent days. And his publication last week of Cohen\u2019s banking history \u2014 hard-to-get information touching on some of the most sensitive issues before the White House \u2014 could jeopardize his ability to represent Daniels in court, some experts say. \u2018Nothing he has been doing in the last four to six weeks with his multiple television appearances advances the interests of his client in the California action,\u2019 said Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor who specializes in ethics. \u2018He\u2019s catapulted himself to be the story. There are dangers when a lawyer becomes so publicly vocal.\u2019\u201d  -- Mueller\u2019s team argued a federal judge should reject Paul Manafort's request for a hearing over an alleged \u201ccampaign\u201d of negative leaks by government officials. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \u201cProsecutors said the sampling of press reports cited by (the former Trump campaign chairman) failed to include any sensitive matters before a grand jury specific to his case \u2014 disclosure of which would violate federal criminal rules to prevent biasing potential jurors \u2014 but instead simply revealed information about a law enforcement investigation. \u2026 [Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann] added that Manafort\u2019s \u2018speculative claim\u2019 fell far short of warranting a hearing or risking derailing the case.\u201d  -- Worth the read: \u201cThe Untold Story of Robert Mueller's Time in Combat,\u201d by Wired\u2019s Garrett M. Graff: \u201cBefore he became special counsel, Mueller freely and repeatedly told me that his habits of mind and character were most shaped by his time in Vietnam, a period that is also the least explored chapter of his biography. This first in-depth account of his year at war is based on multiple interviews with Mueller about his time in combat \u2014 conducted before he became special counsel \u2014 as well as hundreds of pages of once-classified Marine combat records, official accounts of Marine engagements, and the first-ever interviews with eight Marines who served alongside Mueller in 1968 and 1969. They provide the best new window we have into the mind of the man leading the Russia investigation.\u201d  Gina Haspel testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee for consideration to be CIA Director. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  PERSONNEL IS POLICY:  -- A classified memo on Gina Haspel\u2019s role in the post-9/11 enhanced interrogation program has left some senators disturbed. NBC News\u2019s Ken Dilanian reports: \u201cThe document, which has been made available to senators and cleared aides, [cites] cable traffic and internal CIA messages that were not discussed in her public confirmation hearing. The sources, some of whom support Haspel and some of whom do not, say the document describes comments by Haspel in support of the CIA's brutal interrogation program at the time it was ongoing. But they said there was nothing explosive that would change the dynamic of her confirmation chances, which appear to be strong.\u201d  -- The EPA\u2019s inspector general said Pruitt began receiving round-the-clock security from his first day as EPA chief, which came at the behest of former Washington state senator and Trump political appointee Don Benton. Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin report: \u201cIn a Feb. 12, 2017, email to several EPA security officials, Benton framed the decision as a precautionary measure given the controversy sure to ensue from some of the president\u2019s early policy decisions. \u2018I have requested 24-7 protection for the new administrator for the first week at least and then evaluate from there,\u2019 Benton wrote. EPA officials discussed the increased costs and strain on the agency\u2019s criminal-investigations division that would stem from such a move. The acting special agent in charge, Eric Weese, wrote colleagues that nonstop protection would entail doubling the number of agents on Pruitt\u2019s security detail to 16. \u2026 The inspector general\u2019s office, which investigates threats made against any EPA employee, 'played no role in this decision,' [Inspector General Arthur Elkins] added.\"  -- A $1 million contribution to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee appears to have come from a group of conservative legal activists who have been in the driver's seat in picking Trump's judicial nominees. Robert Maguire reports for McClatchy: \u201cThe $1 million inaugural gift came from a Northern Virginia company called BH Group, LLC. Unlike other generous corporate inaugural donors ... BH Group was a cipher, and likely was set up solely to prevent disclosure of the actual donor's name. \u2026 While the source of the money used to make the gift was masked from the public, a trail of clues puts the contribution at the doorstep of some of the same actors \u2014 most notably Leonard Leo, an executive vice president at the conservative Federalist Society \u2014 who have helped promote Trump\u2019s mission, and that of his White House counsel, Don McGahn, to fill judicial vacancies as quickly as he can with staunchly conservative, preferably young jurists.\u201d  NO APOLOGY:  -- The White House once again declined to apologize for press aide Kelly Sadler\u2019s nasty remark about Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). \u201cI understand the focus on this issue, but it's going to be dealt with, and has been dealt with, internally,\u201d deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah said. \u201cI was told Kelly Sadler called the McCain family late last week and did apologize. Beyond that, I don't have any further comment.\u201d (Callum Borchers)  -- McCain\u2019s Republican colleagues are publicly pushing for a White House apology. Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett and Eliana Johnson report: \u201c\u2018Just out of common decency they should apologize. And the person who said it should apologize. It\u2019s wrong,\u2019 said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) .... \u2018Everything happens for a reason. And sometimes the reason is you\u2019re stupid and made a bad decision,\u2019 said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). \u2018She ought to apologize publicly. If it were my administration, and it\u2019s not, I would also apologize on behalf of the administration.\u2019\u201d  -- Mitch McConnell visited McCain in Arizona over the weekend. \u201cJohn and Cindy and I had a chance to sit on their back porch and reminisce,\u201d the Senate majority leader said in a floor speech. \u201cHe still had plenty to say about work, I assure you. He misses his colleagues. He\u2019d rather be here. And I told him we miss him, too.

More than a third of Millennial Republicans agree that the \u2018Earth is warming mostly due to human activity,\u2019 as compared to 18 percent of Boomers and older generations.

The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for some parts of the country.\n\nMotorists were urged to avoid driving in several locations, with some forced to abandon their cars. Many schools were closed. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, which all serve the capital, warned of delays and flight cancellations.\n\nDespite the disruption, the arrival of snow two weeks before Christmas brought a festive atmosphere to Britain's parks and streets.\n\nSnowfall is relatively rare in southern England compared to northern Britain and mainland Europe, and Britons frequently gripe about the ill-preparedness of the country's infrastructure when cold weather hits.\n\nInflation and an energy crisis have added to the concerns this year, as household bills have soared and people worry about whether they can afford to heat their homes.\n\nNational Grid, which manages much of the UK's energy supply infrastructure, has instructed two coal-fueled power stations to start warming up, in case the cold weather threatens the country's power network, Britain's PA Media news agency reported.\n\nThe company said it was a \"contingency\" plan, which aimed to \"give the public confidence in Monday's energy supply,\" according to PA.\n\nCustomers of some energy suppliers are also being asked to reduce their consumption for two hours on Monday evening, in a pre-planned test being run by National Grid.\n\nSunday's snow dump came after several days of cold and icy weather which had already caused tragedy in Solihull, central England.\n\nWest Midlands Police said three boys, aged 8, 10 and 11, have died in hospital after falling into a lake on Sunday afternoon. A fourth boy, aged six, remains in critical condition.\n\n\"Searches of the lake are continuing as we seek to establish exactly what happened and if anyone else fell into the water,\" police said in a statement on Monday.",

                              "text": "Adapted from the latest Radio Derb, available exclusively on VDARE.com  If you followed the recent hysteria about our cruelty to illegal alien children on non-Main Stream Media, you'll be familiar with the depth of nonsense and dishonesty behind it all.  You'll know that the policy causing all the shrieking and fainting has been in place for years, long before Donald Trump showed up. You'll have seen the old clips from not-that-many years ago of Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and both of the Clintons telling us what a great evil illegal immigration is and how we need to take a strong stand against it.  You've probably also heard the numbers. You know that of the 12,000 minors detained in the six weeks of our zero-tolerance policy, only 2,000 were actually with a person claiming to be a parent. That's seventeen percent. You probably suspect, as I and Attorney General Sessions do, that if DNA testing were to be applied, that percentage would drop into low single figures.  You likely know that Mexico, through which these Central American invaders passed, has a well-equipped U.S. embassy and nine, count 'em nine, consulates scattered across that country from Yucatan in the south to Tijuana in the north. Any Central American seeking asylum in the U.S.A. could apply at any of those places, without any fear of being separated from his children.  You probably also know that Mexico is a nation addled with criminality and corruption. Much of what happens there is dictated by crime syndicates who depend on smuggling narcotics into the U.S.A. Those syndicates obviously have a keen interest in keeping our Border Patrol busy with other matters\u2014like, for example, detaining and processing illegal border-crossers.  As of last Friday, you're probably acquainted with the backstory behind Time magazine's current cover picture of a weeping tot who, according to Time, had been ripped from her mother's arms.  The true story\u2014uncovered by the British press, of course, not by our own worthless hacks\u2014is that the child comes from a comfortable middle-class family in Honduras; that the child's mother long fantasized about living in the U.S.A.; and that she at last acted on her fantasy, paying six thousand dollars to people traffickers and heading north without telling her husband, who is left in Honduras with their other three children, aged fourteen to six.[ Honduran father reveals daughter was never separated from her mother, By Daniel Bates and Karen Ruiz , Daily Mail, June 23, 2018]  The husband tells us that to the best of his knowledge child and mother have not been separated \u2026 though child and father obviously have, by several hundred miles, at the mother's initiative.  This whole thing, this whole hysteria, is in other words bogus from top to bottom, just like all the other Progressive hysterias of recent years: Charlottesville, Russian election meddling, Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, the savage racism of asking for voter I.D. at polling stations.  If you pay any attention at all, if you care at all about actual facts, if you're willing to privilege\u2014pardon the word, please: it's the correct word\u2014if you're willing to privilege objective truth over your own surging emotions and personal resentments, you know that it's all one Big Lie.  It's a usual thing for people suspected of a crime to be detained by law enforcement. If they have kids, this perforce separates them from their kids, since no humane society wants kids placed in adult detention facilities.  That's been true in the case of U.S. citizens for ever. To say it should not pertain to non-citizens is to privilege\u2014again, that's the mot juste here\u2014to privilege foreigners over our own people. And foreigners have a straightforward way to avoid this particular peril: They can stay in their own countries.  \"But they're desperate!\" wail the hysterics. \"Their countries are so messed up! And it's OUR FAULT they're messed up!\"  The first thing to be said about that is, that a very great many countries are messed up. Billions\u2014that's \"billions\" with a \"b\"\u2014of people live in messed-up countries. A handful of outliers excepted, all countries are messed up except the few established and majority-populated by Ice People\u2014Europeans and East Asians.  Getting and keeping a not-messed-up country seems to be a difficult, an extraordinarily difficult achievement. Not even Ice People can always pull it off. For a non-messed-up country, iciness is necessary but not sufficient. Russia is quite badly messed up; so is China. Check out Albania. Check out North Korea. Being an Ice People country doesn't guarantee you're not messed up, nor vice versa, but that's the way to bet.  As for the notion of it being our fault that Central American countries are messed up, I don't buy it. For one thing, messed-up-ness is the normal state of affairs for countries not populated and run by Ice People, as just stated.  Take Latin America. It's hard not to notice that the general level of messed-upness down there is greatest where Ice People are least numerous. The southern \"cone\" countries\u2014Chile, Argentina, Uruguay\u2014with mostly Ice People populations, have their problems, no doubt; but none of them is Guatemala or El Salvador. They are the least messed-up Latin American countries.  How is that? Did we evil Gringos just forget to go and mess them up? Please.  I'm put in mind of the reply the Mexican made to the Texan when Tex asked why Mexicans are always so mad at the U.S.A. and blame us for everything. The Mexican's reply, according to P.J. O'Rourke: \"You stole half our country. And not only that, Se\u00f1or, you stole the half with all the paved roads.\"  And then, if your country messed up my country, why would I spend my family's savings and risk life and limb to break into your country, the great messer-upper?  One of the blessings of living in Central America is that if you are dissatisfied with your country, there are lots of countries close by you can flee to for refuge. A citizen of Honduras is closer to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Panama, Colombia, and the Bahamas than he is to the U.S.A., and not much further from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil.  Refuge-wise, he's spoiled for choice. Why would he want to come here, to the Great Satan, with all our cruelty and racism and xenophobia and white supremacy and toxic masculinity?  Mrs. Hernandez, the mother in the Time magazine cover story, doesn't seem at all mad about Uncle Sam messing up her country.  Listings of the Four Cardinal Virtues generally put prudence at number one.  In the realm of the National Question\u2014the question of what kind of nation we wish to be, and of what kind of nation we wish our children and grandchildren to inherit\u2014prudence is surely appropriate.  If getting and maintaining a non-messed-up country is as difficult at it seems to be, and as dependent as it seems to be on a healthy supermajority of Ice People, prudence consists in a strict attention to demographic stability and the avoidance of wild demographic experiments.  With all my heart, and with as loud a voice as I can raise, for the sake of my children and their children, I urge prudence upon our nation's leaders.  But what our nation's leaders are actually doing is \u2026 nothing much.  There are plain political reasons for this. Some of them, some of those reasons, have been the motivations behind this week's hysteria over illegal aliens. Others are more longstanding and baked-in to our system.  Our national legislature is quite finely balanced between the two big parties. The Senate is Republican by 51 percent; the House is Republican by 54 percent (55 percent if you factor in currently vacant seats). Under these circumstances, with midterm elections just twenty weeks away, both parties are of course strategizing like crazy.  The Democrats' strategy is to run out the clock: doing nothing either positive or negative while striving to make President Trump look as bad as possible in the eyes of their base\u2014GoodWhite ethnomasochists and racial minorities. The Main Stream Media are totally on board with this, and pushing the strategy for all they're worth.  That's what this week's hysteria has been about. Random comment from a random media shill, this one actually Charles Blow [Email him] at the New York Times June 17th:  Trump is lying, as he often does. This barbaric policy is an outgrowth of his own personal cruelty \u2026 This practice of family separation must end, and Trump and every other politician who was silent about it or worse, endorsed it, must be held to account at the ballot box.[Trump and the Baby Snatchers]  That puts it as plainly as you could want. Trump is an evil person! Vote Democrat!  Godwin's Law\u2014which states, just to remind you, that as an internet discussion thread grows longer, the probability of someone mentioning Hitler approaches certainty\u2014has been much in evidence in this week's hysteria: so much so, in fact, that even some of the Open-Borders people have felt moved to protest.  Here for example was John Podhoretz, an old-school Jewish immigration sentimentalist and race denialist:  Hitler wanted all Jews dead. Trump wants non-Americans who are here in violation of US law out of the United States. Dislike that all you wish. I do. I do not think this is the right policy. But it's not the systematic elimination of the Other. Stop cheapening the Holocaust to score political points, June 22, 2018  Which might be a bit more persuasive if Podhoretz had not himself done a bit of Holocaust-cheapening five months ago when he compared either Presidential advisor Stephen Miller or our own Steve Sailer\u2014it's not clear which\u2014to Joseph Goebbels.  Still, it's a sign of how crazy things have gotten that even Podhoretz, a neocon's neocon, thinks the Godwinization of our public discourse has gone too far.  That's congressional Democrats and their MSM shills. What about congressional Republicans?  Well, there have been signs of sentient life in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Goodlatte Bill was voted down on Thursday, but it got 193 GOP votes, that's 82 percent of the House Republicans who voted\u2014much better than forecast. Praise and blessings from Radio Derb to all 193 of those House Republicans; a pox on the 41 Republican Nays (except those who, like Rep. Steve King, were voting against the Amnesty provision that the bill was trying to trade for patriotic reforms).  Speaker Paul Ryan himself did not vote. This is customary and not at all remarkable.  Ryan does, however, seem to have taken that better-than-expected 193 vote count to heart. He's been working up a bill of his own, a much cuckier, more donor-friendly bill. He'd planned to bring his bill to a vote this week right after Goodlatte's, but that vote has now been postponed to next week so that Ryan can jiggle the bill a bit to make it more acceptable to the 193. [House Rejects Hard-Line Immigration Bill and Delays Vote on Compromise, By Thomas Kaplan and Nicholas Fandos, The New York Times, June 21, 2018]  There is very little prospect that Ryan's jiggling will make this second bill anything other than what it currently seems to be: a huge mass Amnesty for alien scofflaws garnished with some vague, easily-reversed promises on border security and internal enforcement. That's what GOP donors want, and that's what Ryan will give them. After all, six months from now he'll be working for them openly, full-time, as a lobbyist.  The Senate is as usual immigration-shy and effectively inert. Even if Ryan's bill passes the House, it will die in the Senate. Everybody, including Paul Ryan, knows this.  So it's all kabuki theater. Democrats want to go into the midterms saying to their base that the President is Hitler; Republicans want to go in saying to their base that, heck, we know you want something done and we tried to do something, we really did, but there are just too many darn Democrats in Congress to get anything through.  The actual mood of the Republican base seems to be strongly pro-enforcement, even after this MSM blizzard of stories about howling toddlers being ripped from their mothers' arms. The strong vote for the Goodlatte Bill reflects this: GOP congresscritters have been hearing from their constituents.  My own thumbnail gauge of GOP voter sentiment is, as I mentioned last week, the Letters columns of the New York Post, which I have reason to believe actually reflect the feelings of readers of this conventionally center-right newspaper in a not-very-Republican region.  The Post actually ran an editorial about border detentions as the hysteria got under way, taking quite a stern line against President Trump's policy. [Stop breaking up families at the border, June 17, 2018] I waited patiently to see what the Letters column showed.  That editorial ran on Sunday, June 17. Monday, June 18, nothing. Tuesday, June 19, seven letters. Five of the seven were hysterical. The words \"ripping,\" \"ripping,\" \"kidnapping,\" and \"ripped\" showed up in four of the five. Godwin's law of course kicked in, quote from a Manhattan letter-writer: \"I now feel like I'm living in Nazi Germany,\" That's from the heart of New York City, current mayor Comrade Bill \"Honeymoon in Castro's Cuba\" de Blasio.  Even then, though\u2014on Tuesday, as the hysteria was cresting\u2014two of the Post's seven reader letters were non-hysterical. One blamed the illegals for putting their children at risk. Another calmly suggested using FEMA facilities\u2014Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2014to house the detainees.  Friday the Post ran another batch of readers' letters, nine this time. Only one followed the hysterical line. Incredibly, it refrained from invoking Godwin's Law; but it did include the phrase, quote, \"ripped from their mothers' arms,\" The other eight wanted better border control and scoffed at the hysteria. Seven of the eight supported current policy. The eighth opposed it from the right, deploring, \"President Trump's executive order flip-flop,\u201d which the writer blamed on Ivanka and Melania.  I don't say this is definitive, certainly not any kind of scientific survey. Those letters do show, though, that even here in New York\u2014the beating heart of Left-liberal lunacy and Republican cuckery\u2014there are plenty of people not taken in by the hysteria.  I agree, by the way, with that eighth New York Post reader that Trump's Executive Order was a blunder. The policy that caused all the hysteria\u2014separating kids from their parents or pretend-parents and keeping them in HHS facilities for a few days\u2014was perfectly legal, defensible, and humane. What's supposed to happen now? We put the kids in Border Patrol lock-ups? How is that better?  The logic is inescapable. An adult who crosses the border without authorization is liable to arrest and detention, quite rightly so. If there are children with him, those children need to be detained and cared for, too; though since it's the adult who broke the law, not the child, this is a child-care issue, not a law-enforcement issue.  If child-care detention in HHS facilities is unacceptable, and detention of children in Border Patrol lockups with their parents is unthinkable, the only possibility is to let the kids go. So thousands of children\u2014including a lot of teenagers and likely some adults posing as teenagers \u2014with no proper claim to U.S. residence, have gotten it. And when the accompanying adult really is the child's parent, they'll get to stay too.[\u2018Unaccompanied Migrant CHILDREN\u2019 Arrive at NY Airport -Appear to be GROWN MEN With SCRUFFY BEARDS and Shaving Kits (VIDEO), Gateway Pundit, June 23, 2018]  Our courts will make sure of that. Our courts are in fact a big part of the problem. Michelle Malkin many years ago stated the Prime Directive of immigration jurisprudence: \"It ain't over until the alien wins.\" That will probably be the governing factor in the fate of these Central American border-jumpers going forward.  A friend who knows much more about our laws and Constitution than I do tells me that Congress could in fact bar the federal judiciary from considering these cases.  That's nice, supposing my friend is right and I've understood him correctly; but the chance of Congress actually doing anything that imaginative, or that patriotic, is so small you'd need an electron microscope to see it. So this idea is like\u2014to leap to the other end of the cosmic scale\u2014is like the Heat Death of the Universe: kind of interesting, but not actually relevant to anything likely to happen in our lives.  The President could anyway have spared himself all the wrangling his administration's in for with the judiciary, and could also have spared us this last few day's screeching hysteria, by just doing what he was elected to do: build an effective border barrier.  It's not that hard. Israel's done it; Hungary's done it; Saudi Arabia and India have done it. China did it two thousand years ago.  What, you want to tell me we can't do it until Congress appropriates the funds? I don't believe it. I understand about checks and balances, but the President doesn't have that little power. If we can bomb wedding parties in Afghanistan without a Congressional declaration of war, surely we can put up a decent border barrier.  This has been Trump's greatest failure. Those of who voted for him, campaigned for him, and turned out on freezing winter mornings to show our support for him, need to keep telling him this.  Build the damn wall, Mr. President!

Anyway, I feel that, in taking up all the headlines in the leadup to the US midterm elections, these events all offer clues for discerning minds that a powerful elite group who have controlled us since long before any of us were born are showing increasingly greater signs of desperation. I welcome dissenting views to this opinion, as I certainly don\u2019t have comprehensive knowledge about what is going on, nor do I have privileged access to insider information. I am just seeing a consistent pattern in the events that are happening, especially in the tone and characterization that mainstream media is bringing to these events.  The Deep State has always played the long game with perception-building. Before the internet, the only widely-heard broadcast voices available were more subtly controlled by the Deep State, who could silence virtually anything and only had to make tweaks in the broadcasts from time to time to maintain their preferred perception. But right now, in having to fight against an awakening community with alternative broadcasting voices gaining increasing power, it seems like the Deep State is throwing everything they can at us all at once. And I simply can\u2019t find any other logical explanation as to the nature and increasing frequency of these events other than that we are seeing the desperate death-throes of a once-powerful beast.

Corsi Ph.D. Best Price: $14.95 Buy New $16.25 (as of 09:10 EST - Details)  The Caravan  In examining the caravan of people that is coming up from Ecuador that is intent on penetrating into the United States, a little context is helpful. Much has now become known about how the Deep State has used refugee crises and forced immigration to destabilize countries and create greater global power by weakening national sovereignty. The recent refugee and immigration crises in Europe have become a fairly clear sign of this once we look at it through this lens.  The joint strategy of destabilizing a nation like Syria, and then convincing people that they have to leave their homes and make long migration treks to other countries that most of them have never visited in their lives in order for their families to be safe, must be a huge and highly coordinated enterprise. There must be many insiders placed within these ventures to convince people to leave the only homes they have ever known, and take along young children to an unknown territory. There must be a combination of persuasion and force at play, where the fog of background war and related chaos provides excellent cover for the efficient handling of any dissent or opposition to these massive exoduses.  Back in the days of the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 uprisings, I was naive enough to believe that these mass demonstrations sprung organically from grassroots movements of awakening masses who had finally had enough. It was eye-opening to see in the aftermath of these protests that greater freedom and prosperity was not gained by the people, and in some cases the levels of government control and oppression became even worse. This is not to say that this movement was completely the work of actors; understand that indeed there was real anger and resolve borne from the suffering and degradation of these populations, and these emotions and the real victims who owned them provided much of the fuel for these massive protests. However, a subtle but powerful hidden hand was in control of the outcomes every step of the way, for a particular purpose that was anything but the liberation of an oppressed people.  The same is true of this caravan coming up from Ecuador. It is surely populated by many people whose passions and pain are real, who are honest refugees escaping either violence or hunger or both. However you start suspecting something else is driving them towards the U. S. border when Mexico offers them asylum, permanent status and job opportunities in Mexico\u2019s southern states and several thousand turn them down. Vice President Mike Pence spoke to the Ecuadorian president himself who said that the caravan was \u201corganized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela,\u201d so it begins to become clear that some within this caravan, beginning with the charismatic leaders and organizers, have ulterior motives for getting as many people as they can to the US border that has nothing to do with escaping violence and hunger.  Again, these are complex matters: use your discernment, put the pieces together, go with what resonates with you from a bigger-picture perspective. The video below, where you can see VP Pence speaking on the matter and tie-ins with Q-Anon, helps to make many additional connections:  \ufeff  According to mainstream media, these caravans have been going on for years and rarely get media attention. So why is it getting mainstream media attention now? They are saying that it is Donald Trump who is solely responsible for bringing attention to the caravan as a way to bolster support for the midterm elections. This comes from MSNBC\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe\u2019:  \u2018This caravan, that Donald Trump keeps talking about, that Fox news keeps talking about, the people on the Right keep talking about, as some last-ditch, desperate, sad, pathetic effort to, again, use non-white people to try to scare white people into voting for Republicans.\u2019  The Deep State: The Fa... Mike Lofgren Best Price: $5.63 Buy New $6.00 (as of 06:35 EST - Details) A CBC article entitled \u2018Trump strategists see migrant caravan as a political \u2018silver bullet\u2019 for U.S. midterms. They might be wrong.\u2019 never actually quotes any particular strategist who characterized the migrant caravan as a \u2018silver bullet.\u2019 What it does say is that \u2018Los Angeles-based Democratic consultant Jason Levin said it was not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d to energizing Trump\u2019s base.\u2019 This deceptive use of words has become a mainstream norm. CNN even offered a piece entitled \u2018The Caravan is Already Here,\u2019 an opinion piece that ties the caravan with the mail bomber in a double-barreled attack on Donald Trump.  If mainstream media is so insistent that this caravan is only considered newsworthy by Donald Trump in an attempt to rally his base, then why do they seem to be talking about it so much? And why did the New York Times send a full-time reporter into South America to walk within the caravan and interview some of the people there? Was it perhaps to bolster the narrative that this is a grassroots movement generated solely by innocent people desperately seeking a better life?  The biggest tell in all this is that if you scan mainstream media (right-leaning Fox News excluded), there is not a single word of concern about the hazards of open borders and the implications of hordes of people making thousand-plus mile trips to the US border expecting refugee sanctuary. Let\u2019s even put aside the notion that there are potentially hidden gang members, criminals, and traffickers blending into those groups. Let\u2019s just talk about the implications of a refugee crisis on the US border and its impact on the capacity to uphold current US immigration laws and discourage precedent-setting actions that will encourage more waves of immigrants flooding the borders.  Mainstream media has been absolutely silent on these matters, matters that any thinking human being would surely admit were real and need to be talked about in any conversation about caravans such as this one approaching the US border. This rather timely tweet by Donald Trump certainly underscores the mainstream hypocrisy in this:  I agree with President Obama 100%! pic.twitter.com/PI3aW1Zh5Q \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2018  Whether or not the caravan completes the thousand-mile journey from the southern border of Mexico, which it has now breached, to the US border, remains to be seen. But if a significant number of people do make it to the border, it is possible that we will be witnessing one of the last lines of offense launched by the Deep State before they are finally brought down.

                              "text": "That doesn\u2019t reflect reality, however. Oregon has seen over 100 million mail-in ballots since switching to vote-by-mail in 1998, and no one has ever found significant numbers of fraudulent votes. In 2016, out of over 2 million voters, only 10 Oregonians were convicted of vote fraud. (In fact, mail votes incorporate a number of security measures, including bar-code tracking of ballots and accurate voter registration databases. Most of the time, signatures are used to verify identity.) However, Trump has built part of his political success on lying about mass voter fraud, and the Republican Party has mounted efforts to make voting harder, not easier, such as purging voter rolls and adding further identity requirements. Vote-by-mail is a victim of that partisan attack, even if evidence shows it can increase turnout across the board. In the end, the stimulus bill passed in March did include $400 million to help states with their election problems. It\u2019s a big number, but less than a quarter of the amount voting experts say is needed to run this election safely during the pandemic. \u201cI think it shows a really lamentable lack of properly prioritizing the importance of elections that are the bedrock of our democracy,\u201d says Eddie Perez of the Open Source Election Technology Institute. Still, things could change. When Congress returns later in April, a more robust vote-by-mail bill championed by Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Amy Klobuchar is expected to become a priority. It would give even more cash\u2014the exact amount is still being decided\u2014to those who actually run elections, designating it to speed up the difficult transition to vote-by-mail. The bill, known as the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act, would also ensure that people who cannot vote by mail have more time to vote in person by requiring at least 20 days of early voting to prevent long lines and crowds. It would give states money to hire and train new poll workers to avoid endangering the older folks who usually fill that role. Wyden and Klobuchar may or may not secure the funding they want or the votes in Congress they require. But more money is definitely required to manage the shift properly. McReynolds\u2019s National Vote at Home Institute tallied up the cost in Michigan, including the price of facilities, infrastructure, ballot mailing, voter education, professional services, and employee salaries. Final bill: $37.5 million for that single state, and only if they start the work today. Ground game gone Even if the voting process is expanded, authorities act quickly, and they get all the funds they need, there\u2019s a whole other universe of issues to solve. For example, if so much of the country is under shelter-in-place orders, how will the campaign be fought? Already we\u2019re seeing election season shift as the crisis changes the way we interact and communicate. Rallies have moved from arenas to live streams. For the Democratic presidential primary debates, TV studio audiences were told to stay home. And fundraising has plummeted as markets have gone through some of the steepest drops and most dizzying ascents in US history. When millions of Americans file for unemployment simultaneously, no one is thinking much about donating to their favorite candidates. Jaime Lennon, a spokesperson for Dutch Ruppersberger, a congressman from Maryland, says business as usual is not an option. \u201cHe\u2019s so busy right now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are hitting near records in terms of phone calls and emails from constituents that need help, whether it be unemployment, or small-business owners needing help navigating the new aid package, or just folks with medical questions, like questions about the availability of testing \u2026 It seems like all election operations are on pause at the moment.\u201d \"We are hitting near records in terms of phone calls and emails from constituents that need help\u2026 It seems like all election operations are on pause at the moment.\" Jaime Lennon, Congressional aide Even if there were time to campaign, what would that look like when supporters can\u2019t go knocking on doors to drum up votes and the economic crisis is draining the bank accounts of grassroots donors? \u201cThere is no sunny spin if you are running against an incumbent. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d says Brianna Wu, a software engineer and candidate for Congress in Massachusetts. Unable to knock on doors, Wu may struggle even to get the signatures needed to end up on the ballot, a task her campaign was previously well ahead on. There are plenty of ways to target voters without ever having to meet anyone in person, like phone banking, television ads, and social media. But Wu, who ran and lost in 2018, says it\u2019s not enough. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been fortunate in having a very strong digital game, but one of the lessons I learned in the 2018 race is you cannot win an election by just hanging out online,\u201d she says. \u201cI got about half the votes I needed to win by focusing on digital. And that was great for a first-time candidate, but my hardest lesson is you cannot win without a strong field operation. And I find myself asking, how the hell are we going to do that?\u201d Many candidates\u2014including Wu\u2014had been focused on building the kind of ground game that famously catapulted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to victory in New York City: knock on doors, talk with people, win votes. Now Wu\u2019s campaign is calling up individual houses and asking to send over petitions, pens, and envelopes to get signatures and move their fight forward. Meanwhile, conversations about fundraising are next to impossible. \u201cMy theory is this crisis will benefit the status quo,\u201d Wu says. \u201cIt will come down to name recognition if people vote at all.\u201d The fog of online war The social-media platforms that were exploited as conduits for disinformation in the 2016 election will have more impact than ever in the 2020 campaign: there simply is no better way to reach voters under lockdown. Though the platforms now have new rules and algorithms to limit disinformation, a rapid shift to making the campaigns even more digital creates new opportunities for misleading voters. China, where the pandemic began, first tried to cover up the disease: now it has armies of propagandists spreading conspiracy theories about covid-19\u2019s origins. European Union officials, meanwhile, say Russia is undertaking a \u201csignificant disinformation campaign\u201d against Western Europe, intent on sowing chaos and uncertainty during a crisis. The biggest disinformation threat the US faces, however, may be domestic. In 2016, Trump tried to undermine trust in election results by saying that if he didn\u2019t win, it would be because the system was rigged. And during the coronavirus crisis, while his rivals for the presidency have been muted, he has used his daily press briefings to repeatedly downplay the severity of the pandemic, rewrite the historical record about his response to the situation, and distort or lie about things like the effectiveness of drugs and the availability of ventilators. \u201cYou want a leader to give people hope, but you need a leader to be honest,\u201d says Angus King, a senator from Maine who cochaired the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, a project meant to define the US\u2019s national strategy online. \u201cWhat did Churchill say at the beginning of World War II? \u2018I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.\u2019 He told the British it was going to be hard, with no sugarcoating. President Trump said it\u2019ll be like a miracle and it will just go away, and that this malaria drug is a gift from God. Turns out it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s harmful.\u201d No stopping In the fall of 2018, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the western Pacific Ocean slammed into the Northern Mariana Islands, a commonwealth of the US. The storm had intensified over the span of three days into a category 5 super-typhoon, with winds reaching 175 miles (280 kilometers) per hour. Typhoon Yutu made landfall on October 24, killing dozens of people, destroying hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of buildings, and disrupting life in ways no one there had ever seen before. The Northern Mariana Islands pushed Election Day back a week in order to begin recovering from the storm first. Remarkably, this had never happened before in US history: elections have taken place on schedule through not just the influenza pandemic of 1918 but two world wars and even the Civil War. That means the likelihood of the national election being pushed back or even canceled is virtually nil. Election experts and constitutional lawyers widely agree that such a change would require a constitutional amendment, and little about the current political climate suggests that Congress could pass one. A bigger concern is that without the option to vote by mail, the pandemic will discourage people from voting altogether. The 1918 flu outbreak may have been responsible for low turnout in that year\u2019s midterm election (though turnout fell for the next two midterms as well). More recently, France held its nationwide municipal elections on March 15\u2014just one day after a national lockdown was announced in response to the coronavirus. Turnout was low, and the next round of elections was pushed back by three months as a result. Low turnout in November will inevitably invite claims that the results lack legitimacy. \u201cGenerally speaking, it\u2019s not a good idea to roll out major changes in election rules in the midst of a major election,\u201d says Richard Hasen, a political science professor at the University of California, Irvine, and author of a recent book on threats to American democracy. \u201cBut we\u2019re facing an unprecedented health emergency. And so we\u2019re not going to have a perfect election. The question is how we can make it as good as possible and disenfranchise as few people as possible.\u201d The answer\u2014for voters and for democratic institutions alike\u2014is clear: if America wants to hold an election that produces a \u201cnormal\u201d result without sacrificing people\u2019s health, it has a blueprint to work from. It needs to start now, even if the solution isn\u2019t perfect. And it\u2019s going to require one hell of a lot of paper.",

Ongoing investigations into Pruitt's travel spending and security arrangements were playing out behind closed doors as a trove of new documents circulated among the Republican and Democratic staffers on the Hill.  Staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees EPA, began receiving new paperwork from the agency this week, Anthony Adragna reports. That follows Pruitt's promise to Chairman Greg Walden that EPA would provide the panel with \u201call the documents and information EPA produces\u201d for a host of ongoing inquiries into his conduct. And Pruitt's now-former security guard Pasquale \u201cNino\u201d Perrotta \u2014 who reports suggest was a willing partner in Pruitt's spending on travel and security \u2014 sat down with staff from the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday for several hours. Staffers declined to comment on the substance of that interview, but an aide said Democratic staffers took part in the transcribed session and have access to the documents EPA has shared with the committee.  Story Continued Below  The administrator has maintained a low profile this week. He was not sighted at a swearing-in of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which several of Pruitt\u2019s fellow Cabinet members \u2014 like Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke \u2014 attended. Still, other newly issued documents offered a fresh look into his lobbyist and industry ties. The emails, which were released via a public records request from the Sierra Club, showed consultant and Global Impact Inc. CEO Matthew C. Freedman helped to set the itinerary for a planned trip to Australia for Pruitt, though it was eventually canceled when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.  In the emails, Freedman warned EPA officials that Pruitt could get an angry reception from Australian officials who disagreed with the Trump administration on climate change. \u201cI think that the trip will be more hostile than what the Administrator may be expecting,\u201d wrote Freedman, who now runs an advisory firm and is treasurer of the American Australian Council, a nonprofit whose members include Chevron, BHP and ConocoPhillips. POLITICO's Alex Guill\u00e9n reports more on the details of the documents here. A draft schedule for the trip also included a visit and public appearance at the Australian parliament, though it noted such a stop raised \u201cpotential for protests, negative reaction.\u201d Trips to the Great Barrier Reef and Tasmania were also panned, dubbed a \"bridge too far.\"  More to come? Democratic Sens. Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse contended on Wednesday there were at least 3,100 pages of communications between Pruitt and special interest groups during his time as Oklahoma's AG that now have business before the agency and have yet to be released. In a letter to Pruitt and federal ethics officials, the pair says, the records, disclosed in state court proceedings, include 1,122 pages of \u201cemails containing documents, amicus briefs, and legal strategy which are part of litigation files.\"  Grain of salt: Of course, Pruitt still has the support of the president, who has yet to weigh in publicly since Pruitt's testimony last week. And Sen. Jim Inhofe, a vocal ally of Pruitt, told a reporter from The Oklahoman that he believes Pruitt still has President Donald Trump's support. \"That\u2019s the way President Trump is. He makes up his mind,\" Inhofe told Justin Wingerter. \"It\u2019s kind of like Jeff Sessions ... about five different times I thought he was going to fire him and he never did.\"  GOOD THURSDAY MORNING!

POLL: VOTERS TURN ON PRUITT: Respondents in a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll turned more sharply negative on Pruitt after being told that he \u201cis under investigation for ethical infractions related to the amount of taxpayer money he has spent while in office, specifically on travel, his security detail and pay raises for his personal aides.\u201d Respondents were also informed that Pruitt testified before Congress that \u201che delegated authority to make spending decisions to members of his staff.\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Steven Shepard breaks down how after being told that information, 59 percent of respondents said Pruitt had not conducted himself appropriately. Far fewer, 11 percent, said Pruitt had acted appropriately.  Also in the poll: A slight majority \u2014 53 percent \u2014 said Pruitt should be removed from his position as EPA administrator, while 12 percent said he shouldn't be removed.

BISHOP TO TRAVEL TO PUERTO RICO: House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop is traveling to Puerto Rico this week to survey the island\u2019s recovery in the aftermath of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, he said Wednesday. \u201cThis trip will help me better understand the continuing challenges and what disaster relief is still needed,\u201d the chairman said in a statement. Bishop is set to meet with Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez while there.  Separately, Democratic Rep. Don Beyer requested a hearing on the status of the territory's recovery in a brief letter to Bishop, writing the \"committee has been silent,\" on a host of issues including the island-wide blackout and the privatization of PREPA, among other topics. A spokeswoman for Bishop called Beyer\u2019s claim that the committee had been silent \u201cabsolutely baseless, half-baked and politically motivated,\u201d noting that the committee has held multiple hearings, forums and sent letters on the topic.  MAIL CALL! THE ISDS OF MAY: API, NAM, the Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined together in a letter to President Donald Trump and other Cabinet officials on Wednesday on NAFTA, noting that though they support \u201cefforts to modernize NAFTA to grow the U.S. economy and support American jobs\u201d they want the administration to retain the investment protections and the investor-state dispute settlement.

FOR YOUR RADAR: BLM on Wednesday released draft environmental impact statements for proposed changes to greater sage-grouse conservation plans in Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Oregon. Conservation groups say the amendments largely ignore the hundreds of thousands of public comments that were submitted to BLM asking the Obama-era plans be left alone. But a spokesperson for Interior told the Associated Press the proposed changes are largely technical in nature and arrived via feedback the agency received about the 2015 plans from governors in sage grouse states.

FREEZE FRAME: The administration\u2019s plan to freeze CAFE standards at 2020 levels through 2025 would have an impact on fuel economy, oil consumption and GHG emissions, according to a new report today from Rhodium\u2019s U.S. Climate Service. The report found that freezing CAFE standards at 2020 levels would increase oil consumption in the U.S. by between 126,000 and 283,000 barrels per day in 2025, depending on oil prices. By 2030, the report finds, that impact would be 221,000-644,000, when assuming no change in post-2025 standards. Read the report here.  HAPPY SMALL BUSINESS WEEK: The Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions Forum will launch a video series today on U.S. clean energy companies that have benefited from ARPA-E funding. CRES Forum will begin the series with a video featuring Rita Hansen, CEO of Bend, Ore.-based Onboard Dynamics, a compressed natural gas refueling company. CRES Forum will roll out additional videos in the coming months. See today\u2019s video here.  CUSTOMERS ONLY: While many discussions on grid reliability and resiliency focus on the bulk power system, a new paper out Wednesday explored a \"customer-focused\" approach, recommending a broader framework focused on customers' experiences. The paper, which was prepared for the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, discusses how when viewed from a customer-centric framework, the power system should be seen end-to-end, reaching from the customer \"through distribution and transmission up to power generation and fuel supply.\" See it here.  HIGH WIND MARKS: American Wind Energy Association's recently released market report found that utility and non-utility customers signed contracts for 3,500 megawatts of U.S. wind capacity in the first quarter of 2018, a \"high water mark\" in recent years.

THAT'S ALL FOR ME!  ** A message from America\u2019s ethanol producers and farm supporters at Growth Energy: The boost from high-octane ethanol enhances engine performance and allows for more efficient engine designs. In fact, NASCAR drivers have been running on 15 percent ethanol blends since 2011. Today, E15 is approved for nine out of 10 cars on the road, and consumers have driven over five billion miles using E15. That\u2019s why America\u2019s biofuel leaders at Growth Energy are calling on the EPA to act quickly on the president\u2019s plan to unleash competition at the fuel pump and allow sales of E15 year-round.

The House Energy-Water subcommittee released the text of its draft appropriations bill Sunday night, aiming for $44.7 billion in spending \u2014 an increase of $1.5 billion from the fiscal year 2018 enacted level and $8.17 billion above President Donald Trump's slim budget request.  Overall, nuclear weapons activities and water infrastructure win big in the draft bill. The legislation would give The Army Corps of Engineers $7.28 billion, an increase of $451 million above 2018 to strengthen the nation's water infrastructure, and nuclear weapons activities getting an extra $558 million, to $11.2 billion. DOE's energy programs score $13.4 billion, an increase of more than $500 million above the current year, with $58 million of that increase is targeted for fossil energy technology research, while nuclear energy research gets a bump of $128 million. In contrast, energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, which the panel says \"have already received significant investments in recent years\" are cut by $243 million.  Story Continued Below  On the policy front, the bill includes the perennial rider to repeal the Waters of the United States rule, as well as language that seeks to block a court-ordered change in operations of dams along the Columbia and Snake River systems that prioritize endangered salmon over hydropower production. Annie Snider reports more here for Pros.  Other key numbers in the bill:  \u2014 $117 million for research and development to strengthen the electric grid. That's $41 million above the 2018 levels.  \u2014 $267.7 million to support the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository (more on that further down), an increase of $100 million above the president's budget request.  \u2014 $6.9 billion for environmental management activities, which marks a $257 million decrease from 2018 enacted level and $268 million above Trump's request. That money includes $5.8 billion for Defense Environmental Cleanup to cleanup sites contaminated by previous nuclear weapons production.  The bill text arrives a day before the subcommittee is set to mark up the fiscal 2019 spending bill. House Republicans have previously said they plan to hold stand-alone votes on noncontroversial fiscal 2019 appropriations bills, such as the Energy and Water title, over the summer. The hope is that \u2014 unlike last year \u2014 the Senate will also agree to take up at least some of those individual bills, handing the GOP-led Congress a small victory before the midterms. So far, the Senate has not announced plans to mark up its own version of the legislation. Pro\u2019s Budget and Appropriations' gurus Sarah Ferris and Kaitlyn Burton point out that already this is a faster pace for appropriators. Energy-Water wasn\u2019t completed until July 12 last year, but could easily clear the full committee this time around before the Memorial Day recess.  If you go: The House Appropriations Energy-Water Subcommittee will meet today to mark up the appropriations bill at 5:30 p.m. in 2362-B Rayburn.  MONDAY, MONDAY, MONDAY!

PRUITT\u2019S POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT: The man who could take over for Scott Pruitt if he were to fall to current swirling scandals is a longtime Washington insider and coal lobbyist, with a reputation for working well with both friends and adversaries, Pro\u2019s Eric Wolff reports. Andrew Wheeler, a former energy lobbyist and top aide to Sen. Jim Inhofe, would likely pursue Pruitt\u2019s same agenda \u2014 but without the additional baggage that Pruitt has brought. That poses a paradox for greens who wish to oust Pruitt but fear Wheeler could be a more formidable opponent. \u201cWheeler is much smarter, and will try to keep his efforts under the radar in implementing Trump\u2019s destructive agenda,\u201d said Jeremy Symons, vice president for political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cThat should scare anyone who breathes.\u201d Read more.  \u2014 Axios reported Sunday that the president is unhappy with a report in The Atlantic that alleges a member of EPA's press team planted stories about Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in order to distract from his boss. A source told the outlet that the president raised the issue in conversation, calling it \"not good.\" And on Friday, Axios reports, Pruitt had lunch with four members of his team at Ambar restaurant on Capitol Hill. A lobbyist tweeted a picture of the gathering, which came as a surprise to EPA senior staff, many of whom have been frozen out of Pruitt's inner circle.  BLANKENSHIP GAINS IN WEST VIRGINIA: Tuesday marks primary elections in four states: Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina and West Virginia. In the latter, coal baron and former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship is reportedly edging to the front. Four Republicans tell POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt that they'd reviewed recent polling that shows Blankenship, who spent a year in jail after an explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine that killed 29 workers, moving narrowly ahead of his more mainstream GOP rivals, Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. They caution the surveys were conducted over a brief period of time and only offer a snapshot of the primary race \u2014 potentially overstating Blankenship\u2019s standing.  Still, many within the Republican Party worry that a Blankenship win on Tuesday could spell trouble in their attempt to take Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's seat come November. The president weighed in this morning, tweeting that Blankenship \u201ccan\u2019t win the General Election in your State...No way!\u201c Morrisey's campaign, who had largely ignored attacking Blankenship, on Saturday released a 30-second robocall blasting Blankenship over an array of issues. Read more.  Not out of options: Blankenship told CBS News on Sunday that he would not rule out a third party bid if Morrisey wins the Republican nomination. \"I have not ruled out anything,\" Blankenship said, adding, \"I've said that I cannot let him win because of the opioid connection and Planned Parenthood connection.\"  THE FINAL COUNTDOWN? Trump is expected to hold yet another meeting \u2014 and possibly his last \u2014 on the Renewable Fuel Standard this week, sources in the biofuel and refining industries tell Pro\u2019s Eric Wolff. It\u2019ll be the seventh meeting of its kind. Trump will host Sens. Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst, Ted Cruz and Pat Toomey on Tuesday. Ahead of the meeting, this open letter to the president will run in today\u2019s editions of The New York Times, New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, calling on Trump to \u201cunleash rural growth by cutting the red tape holding back homegrown energy.\u201d The full-page ads were placed by Growth Energy and signed by member plants from 18 states.  ** A message from America\u2019s ethanol producers and farm supporters at Growth Energy: President Trump agrees that it\u2019s time to lift restrictions on year-round sales of E15, a higher-octane fuel blend with 15 percent ethanol. Biofuels deliver greater performance, less pollution, and more miles per dollar \u2013 a winning combination. Learn more at https://e15now.com **  TRUMP TO MEET WITH AUTOMAKERS: Trump is also scheduled to meet Friday with automaker CEOs for a roundtable event at the White House. Reuters reports that CEOs from General Motors, Ford and Toyota are among the companies invited. The meeting comes at a crucial time for the administration, given its plans to roll back greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars. Several states have already sued EPA over the move, but it notably came after automakers lobbied the Trump administration to revisit the 2022-25 emissions standards. Automakers had indicated they simply wanted more flexibility to reach the ultimate emissions goals in 2025, complaining that would be difficult to meet the Obama-era goals that would have ultimately lifted the average fuel economy target for the nation\u2019s fleet of cars and light trucks to 55 miles per gallon by 2025. Bloomberg reported last week that \u201cexecutives plan to encourage the president to agree with California on measured adjustments to the standards rather than a major rollback\u201d during this week\u2019s meeting.  HOUSE RULES TAKES UP YUCCA BILL: The House Rules Committee is set to take up the bipartisan nuclear waste bill, H.R. 3053 (115), on Tuesday. The long-delayed legislation, introduced by Illinois Rep. John Shimkus (R), amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, updating how the U.S. handles nuclear waste. It would allow the Energy Department to open an interim nuclear waste storage facility while regulators work out a permanent Yucca Mountain repository. Lawmakers have already made changes to the legislation to address the concerns of House appropriators, who held up floor consideration for months over language in the bill that would've limited their ability to specify how money from the Nuclear Waste Fund is spent.  \u2014 For your radar: Democratic Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen filed an amendment to the bill on Friday to stop the DOE from taking action related to the planning and development of a repository until the director of the Office of Management and Budget submits a study to Congress on the economic viability and benefits of alternative uses of the site.  PERRY, ZINKE RETURN TO THE HILL: Both Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry will appear on Capitol Hill this week. Zinke is slated to testify before the Senate Appropriations Interior-Environment Subcommittee on Thursday, an aide told Pro\u2019s Anthony Adragna. Perry will testify a day sooner on Wednesday, this time before the House Science Committee on his department\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019.  \u2014 Perry is also expected to appear at the annual Washington Conference of the Americas on Tuesday to talk \u201cenergy integration in the Americas.\u201d  SPEAKING OF: Former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz is one of several speakers selected to deliver addresses at this year\u2019s Georgetown University commencement ceremonies on May 17, the university announced. Moniz, now CEO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, will speak before the McCourt School of Public Policy.  OFFICE SUPPLIES: In letters to the chairmen of each chamber\u2019s Energy-Water Appropriations subcommittees, Eric Fygi, DOE's deputy general counsel, outlined renovations to the James Forrestal Building that have taken place since the beginning of the Trump administration, as well as renovations made during the previous administration. The letters aim to defend the department\u2019s reporting and approval process in light of an April GAO report that Fygi writes \u201cintroduced ambiguity as to what expenditures require Congressional notification.\u201d The letters to Sen. Lamar Alexander and Rep. Mike Simpson say DOE spent $4,652 for reupholstering furniture and painting in Perry\u2019s office and $4,993 for Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette\u2019s office.  HARTS FINED FOR PRUITT CONDO: Vicki and Steven Hart \u2014 the lobbyist couple whose condo was leased to Pruitt for $50 a night \u2014 paid a $2,034 fine Friday for wrongly renting out the property, a spokesman for the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs told POLITICO. \u201cThe owner agreed to pay the fine for engaging in a business without a housing residential license,\u201d the spokesman said.  MAIL CALL! MARKEY HAS SOME QUESTIONS: Democratic Sen. Ed Markey wrote to Pruitt Friday, asking for more information on the role of lobbyists and non-governmental individuals in scheduling his international trips. The letter comes after The Washington Post detailed how the EPA chief drew up a list of at least a dozen countries he wanted to visit and urged his aides to help him find official reasons to travel, soliciting political allies to help make the trips happen. \u201cThe outsized role you have given lobbyists and non-governmental individuals in setting both your domestic policy agenda as well as your international travel is concerning and leads to even more questions about your ability to objectively serve the American people,\u201d Markey writes. Read it here.  \u2014 Colorado Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Oversight Subcommittee, called on Pruitt to provide further details regarding his real estate dealings with lobbyists while attorney general of Oklahoma. Read that letter here.  \u2014 California Rep. Raul Ruiz and 37 other Democratic lawmakers signed onto a letter last week in opposition of the reopening of the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan.  BANKS ADDED TO CLEARPATH BOARD: ClearPath announced new members of its advisory board today including George David Banks, the former climate and international energy adviser to Trump who resigned in February after failing to secure a security clearance. Since then, Banks was named executive vice president of the American Council for Capital Formation and an adjunct research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy. ClearPath also announced Ed Holland, the former president and CEO of Southern Company Holdings; Richard Mroz, former president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities; and Terry Sullivan, founding partner of Firehouse Strategies, are joining the board.  BISHOP BACKS PUERTO RICO STATEHOOD: House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop endorsed Puerto Rico\u2019s effort to become the 51st state in the U.S. while he was visiting the territory Friday. \u201cI want to be very clear: I'm very supportive of Puerto Rico statehood,\u201d Bishop, whose committee oversees Puerto Rico, said at a press conference in San Juan. Pro\u2019s Colin Wilhelm reports here on how Bishop\u2019s backing will increase momentum for a renewed political push for a change to the island\u2019s status, but came with some caveats. Bishop \u2014 who plans to leave Congress in 2020 \u2014 said he wants Puerto Rico to recover from the longer-term economic issues that have plagued the U.S. territory for the last decade, and noted that \u201cpreconditions\u201d around that economic recovery would have to be met before statehood could move forward.

                              "text": "Considered a toss-up in the midterm elections, the West Virginia Senate race is one where Republicans hope to have the chance to unseat incumbent Joe Manchin, a Democrat who first won the seat in a 2010 special election.  According to a Fox News poll, three Republicans are considered to be \u201ctop tier\u201d candidates ahead of the May 8 primary: Don Blankenship, Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey. Jenkins, a U.S. congressman, topped the list of Republican contenders.  Earlier this month, the candidates faced off in a Fox News debate, with each one trying to align himself with the president more so than the next. All three also maligned Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.  Manchin is not running unopposed; he races a primary challenger in Paula Jean Swearengin, an environmental activist whose platform is more in line with Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont.  President Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 40 points in the Mountain State in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has urged voters to support either Morrisey or Jenkins, saying Blankenship could not win the general election.  From their focus on former President Barack Obama\u2019s policies to their courtship of coal workers, here\u2019s a look at the top three Republicans competing for the GOP nomination today.  Don Blankenship  Don Blankenship, 68, was imprisoned in a federal jail for a year in 2016 after he was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety and health standards -- and he\u2019s still fighting the conviction, blaming the Obama administration every step of the way.  Blankenship, the former head of Massey Energy Company, calls the 2010 explosion that killed 29 people at the company\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine the \u201cworst tragedy of my life.\u201d  Blankenship has sought to have his conviction thrown out, and he\u2019s promoted a pamphlet he wrote in prison that he said sheds light on his prosecution, the explosion and an Obama administration conspiracy against him. He\u2019s also compared the tragedy to that of the 2012 Benghazi attack, calling the blast \u201cObama\u2019s deadliest cover-up\u201d in a campaign ad.  He\u2019s been called the \u201cvillain of our times,\u201d compared to failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and dubbed \u201cthe most hated man in West Virginia.\u201d He\u2019s also been the nearly $745,000 target of the Mountain Families PAC which opposes his Senate campaign.  Despite running for Senate in West Virginia, his primary residence, according to The New York Times, is a $2.4 million home near Las Vegas.  As a candidate, Blankenship has a goal of hosting town hall meetings in every one of West Virginia's 55 counties, according to Politico Magazine. He\u2019s resonating with voters such as Rev. Becky Deitch, the chairwoman of the Brooke County GOP who told Politico, \u201cThe common man doesn\u2019t want another politician. I could tell from his handshake. He\u2019s real.\u201d  \u201cI think the big issue in West Virginia is jobs, and I\u2019m the guy that created a lot of jobs in West Virginia and neither of my \u2026 opponents did,\u201d Blankenship told Fox News. He also said he\u2019s \u201cbetter positioned\u201d to deal with the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic that has hit West Virginia particularly hard since his company dealt with workers who struggled with drugs.  A supporter of Trump, Blankenship advocates for building a border wall and ending so-called sanctuary cities.  However, Trump has urged voters not to support Blankenship, saying that he could not win the general election. That lack of support hasn't seemed to phase Blankenship, though.  \"Neither of my opponents can beat Joe Manchin without my support, but I will beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment,\" he said in a statement to Fox News. \"West Virginia voters should remember that my enemies are Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and my opponents would not even be running as Republicans had I not resurrected the Republican Party in West Virginia.\"  \"As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it,\" Blankenship said of the president's tweet.  Blankenship got into some hot water during his campaign when he said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s father-in-law is a \u201cwealthy China person.\u201d He has accused McConnell of creating jobs for \u201cChina people\u201d and said his \u201cChina family\u201d has given him millions of dollars.  McConnell has been married to Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, since 1993. Chao was born in Taiwan, and her father was born in China.  Blankenship denied the comment was a \u201ctarget on his family,\u201d but rather an \u201cobservation that Mitch\u2019s family is very well-connected in China.\u201d  In Fox News' poll of Republican Senate candidates, Blankenship came in third with 16 percent of likely voters saying they would select him. Still, 24 percent of voters remain undecided, according to the poll.  Evan Jenkins  Rep. Evan Jenkins has been a congressman for only three years, but before that, he served as a state senator in West Virginia for 12 years.  Jobs, coal, senior citizens and the Second Amendment are all important issues to Jenkins, according to his campaign website. He also focused on his anti-abortion record in his first television advertisement.  Jenkins, 57, helped create the nonprofit Lily\u2019s Place, a facility that cares for newborns who are born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which occurs when babies are exposed to drugs while still in the womb.  Jenkins has made a point in his campaign to distance Manchin, one of the more conservative Democrats in Washington, from Trump. However, Jenkins, too, used to be a Democrat. He switched to the GOP in 2013. But that wasn\u2019t his only party switch; Jenkins was first a registered Republican until 1993, according to Roll Call.  As for jobs, Jenkins stressed the importance of coal growing the local economy in an interview with the Herald-Dispatch. He said he\u2019s worked with Trump on easing Obama-era regulations on the coal industry and has supported additional funding for clinics and healthcare services for miners who suffer from \u201cblack lung disease.\u201d  Jenkins told Fox News West Virginia needs a \u201cnew voice\u201d to represent the state in the U.S. Senate.  \u201cThere\u2019s a clear choice,\u201d Jenkins said of the race. He accused Blankenship of \u201cusing his checkbook\u201d to launch a \u201cvendetta\u201d campaign that\u2019s all about his name. As for the state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, another Senate candidate, Jenkins called him \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d \u201cin the swamp\u201d and for the opioid industry.  Jenkins has also stressed during the campaign that he supported Trump in the presidential primary, as opposed to the other candidates.  \"We're starting to see hope and opportunity come back to West Virginia,\" Jenkins told Fox News, saying voters want someone \"who's getting the job done, working with President Trump, bringing this renewed sense of confidence as proud West Virginians.\"  Jenkins leads the field of Republicans in Fox News' poll with 25 percent of likely voters saying they support him. However, 24 percent of voters are still undecided.  Patrick Morrisey  Patrick Morrisey is the first Republican to serve as attorney general in West Virginia since 1933, his campaign website boasts. First elected to serve in the position in 2012, he was re-elected in 2016.  Now Morrisey has his sights set on the U.S. Senate.  In his campaign, Morrisey, 50, has harped on his efforts as attorney general to curtail the state\u2019s opioid epidemic. He sued the Drug Enforcement Administration, saying it allows companies to not take into account patients\u2019 needs when selling drugs. And his office has reached settlements with pharmaceutical distributors for about $47 million, the largest in the state\u2019s history, according to his campaign website.  But his past work as a health care attorney and his wife\u2019s work as a lobbyist who has represented several pharmaceutical clients, including those involved in opioids, have come under scrutiny.  His wife\u2019s lobbying firm was also paid $460,000 by Planned Parenthood, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported last year. Morrisey has said he is staunchly anti-abortion, opposing taxpayer dollars going to Planned Parenthood and supporting repealing Roe v. Wade.  In an interview with Fox News, Morrisey said he's worked with Trump to get rid of some Obama administration regulations and to \"go after\" sanctuary cities. He said he has an \"excellent\" relationship with the president.  \"As voters focus the last two weeks, they're going to learn who is the proven conservative,\" Morrisey said, calling Jenkins a \"political opportunist\" who \"stands for nothing.\"  Morrisey has been endorsed by the conservative National Review, which heralded him as a \u201crock-solid, independent-minded conservative who would be a valuable addition to the right flank of the Republican caucus.\u201d  Morrisey has also been endorsed by Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas.  He is just behind Jenkins, according to Fox News' poll, with 21 percent of likely voters throwing their support behind the attorney general.

                              "text": "By Matt Vasilogambros  On the day of Arizona\u2019s 2016 presidential primary, the line outside the Maryvale Church of the Nazarene, the Maricopa County polling place for 213,000 mostly Latino, low-income people, extended through the parking lot, down busy North 51st Avenue, and into a neighborhood lined with palm and eucalyptus trees on the western edge of Phoenix.  Some voters waited for four hours or more in the 80-degree heat to cast their ballots, according to Martin Quezada, a Democrat who represents the area in the Arizona Senate. Quezada said the long wait time was more than an inconvenience.  Latino voters don\u2019t trust the system, Quezada said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have a good experience on Election Day when they are casting their ballot, their likelihood of participating in a system they don\u2019t trust again in the future becomes that much harder.\u201d  Across the country, elections officials are marshaling data on registered voters, historic turnout, parking spaces and other information to reduce wait times at polling places. Also helping to decrease wait times is voting by mail, which is available in 22 states, and early voting, which is now offered in 37 states \u2014 though a couple of states have rolled back their early voting.  But white voters are benefiting far more from such innovations than Hispanic or black voters are. As the nation gears up for what is shaping up to be a high-energy midterm election this November, the disparity is likely to loom large.  In the 2016 presidential election, black voters, on average, waited 16 minutes to vote, while Latino voters waited 13 minutes, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey of voters. In the same election, white voters waited 10 minutes. In 2012, black and Latino voters stood in line for more than 20 minutes to cast their ballot, nearly twice as long as white voters.  Stephen Pettigrew, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, has found if there are two neighborhoods in the same city, and one is majority-white and the other has more blacks and Hispanics, voters in the white neighborhood have a shorter wait.  Voting rights advocates call the disparity a \u201ctime tax.\u201d They argue that it violates the fundamental right to vote \u2014 and that it is often intentional.  \u201cWe are in a state of threat to voting rights,\u201d said Denise Lieberman, co-director of the Power and Democracy program at the Washington, D.C.-based Advancement Project, a civil rights organization. \u201cSome actions, like changing polling places, may seem benign on its face, but they are creating havoc.\u201d  Fewer Resources  In poorer counties and cities, long lines may stem from a lack of resources. But even in wealthier counties, minority communities tend to get fewer polling places, voting machines and poll workers than white neighborhoods in the same county, according to a 2014 study from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cMinority precincts have tended to get the short end of the resource allocation stick,\u201d the study concluded.  Lieberman argues that in many counties, election officials are less inclined to provide minority communities with the resources that can shorten lines.  It\u2019s one of many policies that are \u201ccreating a climate of discrimination,\u201d Lieberman said, in the same vein as restrictive voter ID laws, the slashing of early voting in states like Florida and North Carolina, and the consolidation of polling places, all of which adversely affect communities of color. Local officials and state lawmakers are trying to suppress the minority vote, Lieberman said.  \u201cNone of this is a coincidence,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThe folks who pass these laws know their impact. \u2026 Communities of color bear the brunt of a lack of legal protection.\u201d  In North Carolina, a federal court agreed in 2016, saying many of the state\u2019s restrictive voting laws, including strict voter ID requirements and a rollback of early voting, \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d North Carolina lawmakers said the laws were passed to protect state elections against fraud and to save counties money.  Cutting Voting Lines  Local election officials know how to keep voting lines short, which makes this time gap so frustrating for voting scholars such as Charles Stewart III, the director of MIT\u2019s Voting Technology Project.  U.S. voters\u2019 wait time shrank to 11 minutes in the 2016 presidential election, down from 14 minutes in 2012, according to MIT\u2019s quadrennial survey. Further, the survey found, fewer voters waited more than an hour to cast their ballot than in the previous election. County officials should be using best-practice tools to decrease wait times in all precincts regardless of their racial makeup, Stewart said.  Many of those tools were implemented after the 2012 presidential election, where hellish voting lines in states such as Florida made national news. (On average, according to MIT\u2019s survey, it took Florida voters 46 minutes to cast their ballots that year.) President Barack Obama took notice, and in 2013 he appointed a bipartisan commission, led by the chief lawyers from his campaign and Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign, to solve the issues that plagued the country\u2019s electoral system.  One of the commission\u2019s primary recommendations was to use data, such as voter registration numbers and parking availability near polling places, to better manage polling places, which would in turn decrease the size of lines. The commission\u2019s goal was to make sure no American ever waits more than a half-hour to vote.  Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the nonprofit Democracy Fund and a member of the commission, said that because election officials are following its recommendations, \u201cthe preponderance of lines is going down.\u201d  Stewart, for his part, launched an online \u201ctoolkit,\u201d which he said is now used by a quarter of the country\u2019s local election officials to help them deploy enough poll booths, poll workers and ballot scanners to handle Election Day voting.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not gathering that data,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cyou\u2019re running blind.\u201d  Michael Scarpello, the registrar of voters in San Bernardino County, California, has embraced that lesson.  To serve the largest geographic county in the contiguous 48 states, Scarpello and his analytics department take a large swath of data \u2014 registered voters, historic turnout, parking spaces, voter behavior, capacity of polling places \u2014 to assign poll workers, distribute supplies\u00ad\u00ad and assign voters to specific polling locations, freeing up busy locations and utilizing underused places. Using this data, Scarpello is able to update polling place capacity by the hour in a county of nearly 900,000 registered voters.  \u201cIf there are lines, they are short,\u201d Scarpello said. At most, voters wait five minutes.  The county\u2019s immediate response to Election Day voter behavior lowers the length of lines, the cost of elections, and the time it takes to count ballots. Between 2008 and 2016, the county cut its ballot-counting time nearly in half, from 16 hours to nine, Scarpello said.  \u201cOur job is to make voting as convenient as possible for voters,\u201d Scarpello said. \u201cIf voters are motivated, we don\u2019t want to put any barriers in their way.\u201d  Closing the Gap  Voting lines in Orange County, California, never surpass nine minutes, said Neal Kelley, the county\u2019s registrar of voters. That\u2019s significant because the county is the fifth-largest voting jurisdiction in the country and because a third of the electorate is Latino.  There is no difference in wait times between Orange County\u2019s majority-white Newport Beach and majority-Latino Santa Ana, Kelley said. Countywide, the average wait time for voters dropped drastically in recent years after Kelley began using sophisticated data techniques to change how they allocate the county\u2019s 11,000 voting booths and 9,000 poll workers among 1,300 polling places.  As the county prepares for a potentially competitive congressional election for 15-term Republican U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s seat this November, Kelley said he\u2019s relying on data from 2010, the last hotly contested midterm election, to estimate turnout for this one.  Kelley said he will monitor precincts closely on Election Day. \u201cOne booth could make all the difference in the world.\u201d  In Maricopa County, where Quezada and his neighbors waited so long to vote in 2016, the official in charge of that election has paid a price.  Helen Purcell, then Maricopa County\u2019s recorder since 1989, had reduced the number of polling places for the 2016 primary, recommending 60 polling places in the fourth-largest county in the United States, down from 200 in 2012.  In the aftermath of the election, The Arizona Republic found that low-income, Latino neighborhoods bore the brunt of the decrease. Purcell, a Republican, denied that race was a motivating factor, but she faced widespread criticism and lost her reelection bid to Democrat Adrian Fontes, who became the first Latino elected as Maricopa County recorder.  After he won, Fontes promised that actions that might limit the Latino vote in future elections will be \u201cvery vigilantly avoided.\u201d",

                              "text": "The Color of the Wave to be Determined by Those Most Afraid  November 2nd, 2018  TheTollOnline.com  Read by 3,105 people Doug \"Uncola\" LynnNovember 2nd, 2018 This article was originally published by Doug \u201cUncola\u201d Lynn at TheTollOnline.com Regarding the upcoming election on Tuesday November 6, 2018, there can only be one of three possible outcomes: 1.) Blue Wave 2.) Red Wave 3.) No Wave The third result would, of course, be manifested as dramatic wins and losses for both Republicans and Democrats with either party coming out slightly ahead overall. But given the perceived high stakes of this particular election as a referendum on President Donald Trump, the winners will be determined by those voters who fear the most. Certainly, there is much anger in this election, and that\u2019s what happens: When people become scared, they get angry. Trump supporters fear losing their nation to globalism, open borders, offshoring, and politically correct fascism; which is just another name for Cultural Marxism. Liberal Democrats on the other hand, don\u2019t fear for America, per se, but rather their collective existence which requires everything mentioned heretofore that Trump supporters will vote against. In other words, on Tuesday, some Americans will be voting for national sovereignty and to uphold the U.S. Constitution, whereas others will vote for a new world order, globalist orthodoxies, and economic redistribution by means of a powerful centralized government. Regardless of who wins, however, there remains the possibility that the allegorical train has already left the proverbial station. Or stated another way, it may be America is already gone. Consider the fact that U.S. corporations are now fascist. Four months after Donald Trump was elected, The Washington Post adopted its slogan \u201cDemocracy Dies in the Darkness\u201d. That is, in fact, downright Orwellian because the titan, Jeff Bezos, attended the Bilderberg conference in Watford, Hertfordshire, England in June of 2013 and purchased the Washington Post four months later, in October 2013. Within six months, even the liberal Huffington Post reported concerns over Bezos\u2019 collusion with the United States Central Intelligence Agency: The Post is supposed to expose CIA secrets. But Amazon is under contract to keep them. Amazon has a new $600 million \u201ccloud\u201d computing deal with the CIA. The situation is unprecedented\u2026. American journalism has entered highly dangerous terrain. Of course, the Washington Post had been a CIA Mockingbird publication for some time, under the stewardship of its previous owner Katharine Graham. And, today, internet social media companies like Twitter and Facebook have also aligned with the Democrats, on behalf of the powerful, centralized state. Even the world\u2019s largest online search engine company, Google, uses the tagline \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d. It\u2019s just another Orwellian mind-trick because the CIA made Google: In reality, Google is a smokescreen behind which lurks the US military-industrial complex. Therefore, it is no surprise that Republican candidates have had their ads censored by the online behemoth during this election season. As of this writing, the most recent example of the \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d company\u2019s digital warfare on a GOP candidate took place on Tuesday October 30, 2018 when the following ad for Rep Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn) was obviously deemed too effective for Google\u2019s liking: \ufeff Hopefully, the reader will be able to view the 30 second video before Google\u2019s YouTube platform takes it down. In a free nation, when corporations like Nike go full Kaepernick, we don\u2019t have to buy their shoes. And since Google really IS evil, we can just use another search engine. Even better, in a free country, entrepreneurs can start up competitive companies and let the free-market sort it all out, right? Wrong. The online platform Gab was an alternative to Twitter and now it\u2019s gone. The excuse? A psycho shooting up a synagogue in Pittsburgh \u2013 although those who politicized that event obviously cared more for negating American\u2019s First and Second Amendment rights than for those murdered. Gab says they\u2019ll be back soon. We\u2019ll see. In any case, in a free nation, their viability should never have been questioned, let alone challenged, over unrelated circumstances. During Brett Kavanuagh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination process, the Democrats also completely bared their collective asses and looked like rats and fools to common sense Americans. When polls began to show an energized Republican base about to neutralize any hope for a Blue Wave, the Orwellian Media quickly switched channels to show the slow-motion Latin American invasion. When that backfired as well, what happened next? Shock and awe anarchy committed by a Cuban-Caucasian Native American Deplorable and an Anti-semitic Caucasian Never Trumper. Do you believe in coincidences? Next, the Orwellian Media reported the mail-bomber, and synagogue shooter, as exemplifying the decline of America under Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric and divisive politics. In response, Trump doubled down on the Orwellian Media as the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d: There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly. That will do much to put out the flame\u2026 \u2026.of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony. Fake News Must End! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2018 Whether or not the white Native-American mail-bomber was a patsy, or leftist operative, and even if the anti-Semitic synagogue shooter was a MK Ultra asset who answered his phone at just the right time \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters most is how these types of events are always politicized by the Political Left and morphed into mind-control by the Orwellian Media. They are, in fact, the enemy. Undoubtedly, the puppetmasters manipulate their puppets by perception. But it only works for so long because reality is inevitable. The science-fiction author, Philip K. Dick, once said: Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn\u2019t go away. Therefore, it\u2019s always a mere matter of time before the puppetmasters are seen as lying manipulators. Or, at the very least, the luckiest bastards ever to have published photos of a pristine white van, plastered with strangely unfaded pro-Trump stickers, owned by a whiter than average homeless Indian who just sent pipe-bombs to all of the modern-day heroes of the American Democratic Party. Immediately, cell phone news applications like \u201cFlipboard\u201d were sending out all of the right information to all of the left people: That the perp was a registered Republican, white-van-owner, and that\u2026 A White Van Laden With Stickers Is at Center of Bombing Investigation\u2026. One sticker has a Photoshopped image of President Trump standing on a tank, haloed by fireworks with an American flag behind him. \u201cDishonest Media,\u201d and \u201cCNN Sucks,\u201d reads another one, the cable network\u2019s logo affixed to it. And then there are the memes expressing support for the president and animosity toward his critics. At the same time, CNN was calling the bomb recipients \u201cTrump Targets\u201d as the Orwellian Media breathlessly reported on how the incident had curtailed Republican enthusiasm in the midterms. Also that the mail bomb story had successfully diverted attention from the Kavanaugh fiasco and the Honduran Caravan coverage; both of which we\u2019re perceived as galvanizing Republicans. By way of Tweet, Trump agreed: Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this \u201cBomb\u201d stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows \u2013 news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2018 Call this blogger a paranoid tin-foil-hatter, but the whole Cesar Sayok Deplorable Mail-Bombermovie of the week seemed reminiscent of the Kavanaugh debacle. It was a classic in-your-face operation that screamed: \u201cLook what we can do whenever we want\u201d. At the same time, the failed bomb plot was perfect fodder to play as propaganda to the loony left who bought it all like they do Chinese junk on Black Friday. When the conservative internet personality, Alex Jones, was banned from social media last summer, both he and the internet activist, Mike Adams, predicted false flags were coming prior to the midterms. Adams exclaimed: For the last two months, I\u2019ve been warning about the rising risk of a major false flag attack taking place before the mid-term elections. The aggressive, unprecedented PURGE of Alex Jones / InfoWars underscores the desperation of the totalitarian deep state that\u2019s about to make a move to eliminate President Trump and / or steal the elections\u2026.. The radical Left is escalating its violence across America, and the tech giants are dramatically escalating their censorship actions to silence all independent voices that might question any \u201cofficial\u201d narrative. It all points to something big about to come down \u2014 something so big that only the official narrative can be allowed to be heard or spoken. Adams has since identified the process as first the \u201cvilification\u201d of Jones, then the \u201ccensorship\u201d, and then the operation as transitioned into the \u201ckinetic phase\u201d. We were also warned how the media shock and awe would be blamed on Donald Trump. Without fail, all of it happened over the last several days and, conveniently, just prior to the midterms. Adams\u2019 prediction is also very chilling regarding the Honduran Caravan being turned into a kill zone in the days before the election. Remember, Trump said he would send in the military and the mob would NOT be allowed into the U.S. There are now reports of 15,000 troops gathering on America\u2019s southern border. If Trump keeps the caravan out by force, the Orwellian Media will have a field day portraying Trump as Hitler and the illegal invaders as Jews queued up before the oven doors. At the same time, no questions will be raised as to how well-timed, coordinated, and sufficiently funded, was the caravan. And if Trump allows the mob to cross the border, then his word will be shown as no good to his base. Tricky business, indeed. Regardless, on any other week, NBC burying information that would have discredited Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers, and attorney Michael Avenatti being referred to the Department of Justice for investigation \u2013 would have been YUGE stories. But that\u2019s exactly how the Orwellian Media works. They emphasize various propagandic narratives while simultaneously tossing any contravening reporting right down the memory hole. It is nothing less than the electronic programming of the masses. Combine this with the censorship and memory-holed jettisoning of truth-tellers from online platforms, along with Google\u2019s biased search engine reporting \u2013 and if there is a Blue Wave in a few days, these will be the reasons. It seems heritage Americans, with their guns, now remain as the allegorical last man standing between the U.S. Constitution and all-out globalism. Drive down any city street, in any neighborhood, prior to the vote on November 6, 2018, and you\u2019ll see neighbors right next door to each other, and just across the street from one another, with opposing candidate signs in their windows and yards. This means these Americans are, literally, living and sleeping just yards away from their ideological enemies. We are now in the soap box phase. On Tuesday comes the ballot box phase. Then, regardless of outcome, we will very possibly enter into the bullet box phase. Of course, that\u2019s why the Orwellian Media requires endless news stories starring explosive projectile dispensers: To generate the necessary urgency to corner any criminals quickly followed by their immediate electronic prosecution, judgment, and sentencing. The Democrats are afraid of guns, so they only want a powerful centralized state to have them. They also fear not being able to abort their babies, the weather (i.e. Climate Change), and transgenders losing their Obama-ordained bathroom privileges with your wives and daughters. The Republicans fear the insanity of Democrats, the New World Order, and outcomes far more sinister than even Orwell imagined: The pulp fiction horror writer, H.P. Lovecraft, once said: The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown. And Donald Trump has stated: My whole life is about winning. I don\u2019t lose often. I almost never lose. The deck is stacked and the stage is set. Here\u2019s what losing might look like: Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker, Adam Schiff as Intelligence Committee Chairman, and Maxine Waters as head of the House Committee on Financial Services. Frightening prospects, indeed. But even if Trump and the Republicans hold the line, it will have been just another battle in the long war.

                              "text": "I'm just going to say it. The only people I've ever seen become truly violent are those aligned with Democrats. That's not saying all Democrats are violent, but those that would support them are mostly Marxists, which means the ends justifies the means. With that said, this news about pipe bombs going to key Democrats raises some suspicions just weeks ahead of the elections.  We're not talking about unknown Democrats here. We're talking the usurper Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah and Hillary Clinton, as well as fake news network CNN, who are nothing more than Communist useful idiots.  First, The New York Post reports:  take our poll - story continues below Who will cave first over the government shutdown? Who will cave first over the government shutdown?

The explosive device sent to CNN\u2019s New York headquarters was a pipe bomb and came with an envelope of white powder, police said Wednesday. \u201cResponding officers identified a device that appeared to be an explosive device and they removed it for investigation,\u201d NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said at a press conference outside the news network\u2019s Columbus Circle offices. \u201cAdditionally there was an envelope of white powder that was part of that packaging.\u201d The powder is being tested on site, while the device has been removed to the NYPD\u2019s firing range in the Bronx and will then be taken to the FBI\u2019s lab, officials added. The package was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan \u201cc/o CNN,\u201d the network says.  NYP then went on to report:  The NYPD busted out its rarely seen Total Containment Vessel to ferry a pipe bomb Wednesday from CNN\u2019s Midtown headquarters to The Bronx. Members of the department\u2019s elite Bomb Squad carefully loaded the device into the back of the TCV, mounting it onto a suspended net inside the chamber designed to minimize jostling on the tense ride north to the Rodman\u2019s Neck facility, police sources said. The TCV, which is mounted onto the back of a truck belonging to the NYPD\u2019s Emergency Service Unit, is engineered to withstand a blast from within should the device trigger during the trip, minimizing damage to those on the outside, sources said. Advance department vehicles blocked off a route north from Midtown to the Rodman\u2019s Neck facility, freeing up a path for the TCV to travel both quickly and with minimal risk to civilian motorists. Escorted by a convoy of emergency vehicles including an ESU truck and an ambulance, the TCV wound its way to the remote firing range and training facility, depositing its volatile cargo in the early afternoon.  Once everything was in the clear, CNN President and Trump friend-turned-foe Jeff Zucker decided to blame President Donald Trump's \"attacks on the media\" for the bomb scares.  In issuing a statement, Zucker wrote: \"There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their attacks on the media.\"  Hypocritically, he added, \"The President, and especially the White House Press Secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.\"  Interestingly enough, Zucker has never once spoke out like this about Maxine Waters and her calls for mobs to hound Republicans and Trump supporters in public and declare they aren't welcome.  What's even more suspicious is the fact that the alleged bombs were fake.  BREAKING: Authorities have determined that some of the bombs were FAKE, not operable, designed as an elaborate stunt \u2014 Paul Sperry (@paulsperry_) October 24, 2018  Not to mention, how does Mr. Zucker know this isn't their supporters or Antifa, which is also their supporters? They are the ones who actually condone violence against the innocent. Just look at the Holocaust of American bodies via the abortion industry that CNN and Democrats support nationally! We still haven't heard CNN condemn the violence encouraged by Democrats like Maxine Waters or the talk of assassinating a sitting president.  Speaking of Maxine Waters, Fox News reports:  A law enforcement source also tells Fox News that U.S. Capitol Police were investigating a suspicious package addressed to Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., at the Capitol Hill mail screening facility. In a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, Waters said Capitol Police had told her that \"my Washington, DC office was the target of a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI. \"I am appreciative of the law enforcement entities who intercepted the package and are investigating this matter,\" Waters added. \"I unequivocally condemn any and all acts of violence and terror.\"  To top it off, actor Jim Carrey painted a picture of a bomb in President Trump's mouth and tweeted, \"Today they tried to murder two Presidents as well as public servants and journalists. Make no mistake, these terrorists were encouraged and emboldened by the hate speech of Donald Trump. If you can\u2019t see the clear menace of this man\u2019s influence by now then you are a part of it.\"  Today they tried to murder two Presidents as well as public servants and journalists. Make no mistake, these terrorists were encouraged and emboldened by the hate speech of Donald Trump. If you can\u2019t see the clear menace of this man\u2019s influence by now then you are a part of it. pic.twitter.com/L7kYcpcPKO \u2014 Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) October 24, 2018  Carrey is a funny guy as an actor. Maybe he should simply stick to acting.  It's funny though, remember Hillary Clinton's statement that Democrats wouldn't be civil till they took back over the federal government?  \u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,\u201d Clinton said on CNN.  \u201cThat\u2019s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that\u2019s when civility can start again,\u201d she added.  \u201cBut until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.\u201d  Holder similarly dismissed civility in politics, claiming that the new Democrat slogan is: \u201cWhen they go low, we kick them.\u201d  These are the people who have advocated for incivility and violence. Now, they are faking these bomb threats, which are my guess since most of them were fakes. Not one of them exploded. They are using it for political gains and nothing more.  President Trump also denounced the bombs as abhorrent.  \u201cIn these times, we have to unify, we have to come together, and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts and threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America,\u201d Trump said.  \u201cThis egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear as Americans,\u201d Trump continued.  \u201cWe are extremely angry, upset, unhappy about what we witnessed this morning and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d he added.  Even the first lady chimed in.  \u201cWe cannot tolerate these cowardly attacks and I strongly condemn those that choose violence,\u201d Melania Trump said.  Candace Owens also thinks the time of the bombs are suspicious.  \u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and state that there is a 0% chance that these \u201csuspicious packages\u201d were sent out by conservatives,\u201d she tweeted.  \u201cThe only thing \u201csuspicious\u201d about these packages, is their timing. Caravans, fake bomb threats\u2014these leftists are going ALL OUT for midterms,\u201d Owens added.  https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1055152462061957121  She's right. This is nothing more than political theater for those who get so caught up in what is nothing more than a WWE match to control the American people and undermine the US Constitution.  I might be inclined to think differently if one of the bombs had actually exploded when one of the recipients received it. Until then, political theater.",

                              "text": "VIdeo by CBS News  Voters head to the polls in four states to pick candidates for key House, Senate, and gubernatorial races.  The next big slate of primaries is up Tuesday, May 15. Voters in four states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska, Oregon, and Pennsylvania will head to the polls to select candidates for key congressional, Senate, and governor\u2019s races.  Pennsylvania will be the election headliner of the evening. The state is crucial for the Democrats to have a shot at retaking the House of Representatives in November, and Tuesday will set up match-ups for the midterms. There\u2019s also a heated GOP gubernatorial race in Idaho, and whoever wins the Republican primary will likely become the state\u2019s next governor.  Here\u2019s what to watch in every state.  Pennsylvania  Polls close: 8 pm Eastern time  Pennsylvania\u2019s primaries may be a preview of Democrats\u2019 national prospects in November. Both a new Congressional map and some open seats benefit the Democrats. Tuesday will set the general election contests and offer a clearer picture of Democrats\u2019 chances.  Three open seats in Republican-held districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 \u2014 Pennsylvania\u2019s Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh \u2014 offer solid opportunities for Democratic pickups.  There\u2019s also a few districts where Republican incumbents look shaky because they\u2019re facing primary challengers: the 11th, a heavily Trump-voting district where Rep. Lloyd Smucker faces a challenge from the right; and the 12th District, where Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko is running against incumbent Rep. Tom Marino, who faces questions over his ties to the opioid industry. The opioid crisis is the key issue in the race.  A Senate seat is also up for grabs. Incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will await his Republican midterm challenger. Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) and state Rep. Jim Christiana are battling it out. Casey will most likely defeat either one of them in the general, but Pennsylvania, which went for Trump in 2016, can be unpredictable.  Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is also up for reelection. He\u2019s the favorite to win in November, but depending on who wins the GOP primary, things could get interesting. The Republican candidates are state Sen. Scott Wagner; litigation attorney Laura Ellsworth; and a former paratrooper and consultant Paul Mango.  Slideshow by photo services  Idaho  Polls close: 8 pm Mountain time or Pacific time  Idaho\u2019s gubernatorial seat is wide open, after the Republican incumbent decided not to seek a fourth term. That led to a crowded GOP primary field, and three candidates have risen to the top: Brad Little, the current lieutenant governor and the establishment pick; Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID), a House Freedom Caucus founding member and the ultraconservative in the race; and Tommy Ahlquist, a former physician and real estate developer who\u2019s painting himself as the outsider.  Whoever wins the primary is almost guaranteed to sail to the governorship, which is why this primary race has become so contested \u2014 and expensive.  Democrats are mostly battling it out for the honor of losing to a Republican in November. But the contest is a microcosm of the larger divisions among Democrats. Paulette Jordan, a 38-year-old two-term Idaho state legislator, has won national endorsements from progressive groups, but the state\u2019s liberal establishment has mostly gotten behind A.J. Balukoff, an entrepreneur who launched a failed bid for governor in 2014.  \u00a9 Drew Angerer/Getty Images Rep. Raul Labrador, a candidate in the mix for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in Idaho.  Nebraska  Polls close: 8 pm Central time/7 pm Mountain time  Incumbent Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) is the favorite to win the general. But a female Democratic challenger, Jane Raybould, a Lincoln City Council member, could be a contender if she wins the Democratic primary. Both politicians are seen as able to work across the aisle. Fischer will still probably cruise to victory, but as Vox\u2019s Tara Golshan writes, \u201cif 2018 starts to get really weird, we\u2019ll have to check back in with the Cornhuskers.\u201d  There\u2019s also the potential for Democrats to reclaim a House seat in Nebraska\u2019s Second Congressional District, which includes Omaha and its suburbs. Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) won the seat in 2016, defeating then-incumbent Democrat Brad Ashford by a percentage point.  Ashford wants to repay the favor in 2018, and is running for the Democratic nomination. He\u2019s the frontrunner with name recognition but faces a strong progressive challenge from Kara Eastman, a nonprofit manager.  Both Ashford or Eastman will likely be competitive in the general against Bacon. The Cook Political Report rates Nebraska\u2019s Second as a toss-up.  Oregon  Polls close: Mail-in; ballots must be received by 8 pm Pacific time  Incumbent Gov. Kate Brown (D-OR) has the clear edge against her primary challengers. As the Oregon Statesman points out, her competitors have raised no money and also have no experience in elected office. Instead, it will be about the share of the vote for Brown, who won a 2016 special election but whose popularity has declined in the past year.  That may give a Republican candidate a small opening in November \u2014 but it\u2019s still an uphill battle in deep-blue Oregon. Still, there are a few GOP candidates who are fighting it out for the nomination. State Rep. Knute Buehler, a moderate with legislative experience; former Navy pilot Greg Wooldridge, who describes himself as a \u201cpragmatic conservative;\u201d and entrepreneur Sam Carpenter, who is the Trump-like candidate.",

First and foremost, I want to say that this has nothing to do with the midterm elections because I was going to send an e-mail regardless of the outcome. However, I guess one could argue that, in the end, the midterms are an important measure of a president's overall success, though I wouldn't go so far as to call the results a referendum. Legislatively, I feel I've had a lot of success that I think history will judge quite favorably. I mean, pretty much every modern president has seen his party lose seats during a midterm, you know?\n\n\"Anyway,\" the e-mail continued.\n\nA 150-page printout confirms that while Obama's points are generally cogent in the first quarter of the message, the increasingly chaotic spacing, multiple spelling errors, and near total lack of commas rendered the later portions almost impossible to parse.\n\nExcerpts indicate an erratic use of capitalized and underlined words, with the phrase \"Stopped a second Great Depression\" mentioned 14 times in a bolded red font double the size of surrounding text. In addition, the e-mail contained multiple links to the Wikipedia entry for Social Security and line graphs of Ronald Reagan's year-by-year approval ratings.\n\nBecause Obama copied and pasted some critical passages directly from right-wing editorials and personal blogs, the e-mail included formatting irregularities that caused many citizens to receive a message in which all of the apostrophes were replaced with question marks. Moreover, some software flagged it as spam.\n\n\"I don?t mean to be rude, but I thought we were all on the samepage about helath care reform,\" the 29th paragraph of Obama's e-mail read in part. \"It was part of my platform. You all knew I was goingt o pursue it when you elected me. And just real fast, going back on what I said earlier, the economic stimulus cut taxes for 95% of Americans. It didn't raise them. It cut them. You people need to look at facts and stop litnening to all the right wing crap out there. By the way, we're basically out of Iraq now. You?re welcome.\"\n\n\"JESUS CHRIST, WE LOST OVER @ MILLION JOBS BEFOREE I EVEN TOOK OFFICE!!!11!\" reads a sentence occupying a large white space between two massive chunks of texts, one of which was a 6,500-word tangent on the Muslim community center being built two blocks from the former World Trade Center site.\n\nAccording to White House sources, Obama \"snapped\" late Tuesday afternoon when a staffer reminded him he was scheduled to take a call from incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner. At that point, a visibly disgusted Obama was observed slowly repeating the words \"House Speaker Boehner\" before ordering everyone to leave the Oval Office, where he sat typing and, according to some, banging angrily on his keyboard for the next five hours.\n\nWhen White House Chief of Staff Pete Rouse urged the president to sleep on the e-mail, Obama told him he had already sent it.\n\n\"In terms of fulfilling campaign promises I think I've actually done a pretty good job in terms of fulfilling campaign,\" Obama wrote in response to an anonymous comment made to a post by conservative blogger Michelle Malkin. \"I know I said I'd close Guantanamo and I sti5ill want to do that but it's harder than it looks. And yes I know I said it would be done by now along with energy reform too\u2014-trust me it is still a priority because \"TOGETHER WE CAN & MUST EMBRACE CLEAN ENERGY\"\"\n\n\"Yes we can!\" the e-mail concluded. \"Ugh, you know what? Forget it. Believe what you want. Yours, Barack.\"\n\nThus far the response from the American public has been subdued, though a sixth of the populace did not even receive the e-mail because the message generated 50 million mailer-daemon delivery failure notifications.\n\n\"I tried reading [Obama's] e-mail, but it was just way too long,\" said 48-year-old Sophia Washington of Moraine, OH, adding that because her computer displayed the text all on one line, she had to scroll from left to right in order to read it. \"I just ended up skimming to see if my name was in there. It wasn't, but I did notice that my daughter can stay on my insurance for one more year. That's great. I think that's because the Republicans won the midterms.\"",

                              "text": "Adapted from the latest Radio Derb, available exclusively on VDARE.com  If you followed the recent hysteria about our cruelty to illegal alien children on non-Main Stream Media, you'll be familiar with the depth of nonsense and dishonesty behind it all.  You'll know that the policy causing all the shrieking and fainting has been in place for years, long before Donald Trump showed up. You'll have seen the old clips from not-that-many years ago of Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and both of the Clintons telling us what a great evil illegal immigration is and how we need to take a strong stand against it.  You've probably also heard the numbers. You know that of the 12,000 minors detained in the six weeks of our zero-tolerance policy, only 2,000 were actually with a person claiming to be a parent. That's seventeen percent. You probably suspect, as I and Attorney General Sessions do, that if DNA testing were to be applied, that percentage would drop into low single figures.  You likely know that Mexico, through which these Central American invaders passed, has a well-equipped U.S. embassy and nine, count 'em nine, consulates scattered across that country from Yucatan in the south to Tijuana in the north. Any Central American seeking asylum in the U.S.A. could apply at any of those places, without any fear of being separated from his children.  You probably also know that Mexico is a nation addled with criminality and corruption. Much of what happens there is dictated by crime syndicates who depend on smuggling narcotics into the U.S.A. Those syndicates obviously have a keen interest in keeping our Border Patrol busy with other matters\u2014like, for example, detaining and processing illegal border-crossers.  As of last Friday, you're probably acquainted with the backstory behind Time magazine's current cover picture of a weeping tot who, according to Time, had been ripped from her mother's arms.  The true story\u2014uncovered by the British press, of course, not by our own worthless hacks\u2014is that the child comes from a comfortable middle-class family in Honduras; that the child's mother long fantasized about living in the U.S.A.; and that she at last acted on her fantasy, paying six thousand dollars to people traffickers and heading north without telling her husband, who is left in Honduras with their other three children, aged fourteen to six.[ Honduran father reveals daughter was never separated from her mother, By Daniel Bates and Karen Ruiz , Daily Mail, June 23, 2018]  The husband tells us that to the best of his knowledge child and mother have not been separated \u2026 though child and father obviously have, by several hundred miles, at the mother's initiative.  This whole thing, this whole hysteria, is in other words bogus from top to bottom, just like all the other Progressive hysterias of recent years: Charlottesville, Russian election meddling, Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, the savage racism of asking for voter I.D. at polling stations.  If you pay any attention at all, if you care at all about actual facts, if you're willing to privilege\u2014pardon the word, please: it's the correct word\u2014if you're willing to privilege objective truth over your own surging emotions and personal resentments, you know that it's all one Big Lie.  It's a usual thing for people suspected of a crime to be detained by law enforcement. If they have kids, this perforce separates them from their kids, since no humane society wants kids placed in adult detention facilities.  That's been true in the case of U.S. citizens for ever. To say it should not pertain to non-citizens is to privilege\u2014again, that's the mot juste here\u2014to privilege foreigners over our own people. And foreigners have a straightforward way to avoid this particular peril: They can stay in their own countries.  \"But they're desperate!\" wail the hysterics. \"Their countries are so messed up! And it's OUR FAULT they're messed up!\"  The first thing to be said about that is, that a very great many countries are messed up. Billions\u2014that's \"billions\" with a \"b\"\u2014of people live in messed-up countries. A handful of outliers excepted, all countries are messed up except the few established and majority-populated by Ice People\u2014Europeans and East Asians.  Getting and keeping a not-messed-up country seems to be a difficult, an extraordinarily difficult achievement. Not even Ice People can always pull it off. For a non-messed-up country, iciness is necessary but not sufficient. Russia is quite badly messed up; so is China. Check out Albania. Check out North Korea. Being an Ice People country doesn't guarantee you're not messed up, nor vice versa, but that's the way to bet.  As for the notion of it being our fault that Central American countries are messed up, I don't buy it. For one thing, messed-up-ness is the normal state of affairs for countries not populated and run by Ice People, as just stated.  Take Latin America. It's hard not to notice that the general level of messed-upness down there is greatest where Ice People are least numerous. The southern \"cone\" countries\u2014Chile, Argentina, Uruguay\u2014with mostly Ice People populations, have their problems, no doubt; but none of them is Guatemala or El Salvador. They are the least messed-up Latin American countries.  How is that? Did we evil Gringos just forget to go and mess them up? Please.  I'm put in mind of the reply the Mexican made to the Texan when Tex asked why Mexicans are always so mad at the U.S.A. and blame us for everything. The Mexican's reply, according to P.J. O'Rourke: \"You stole half our country. And not only that, Se\u00f1or, you stole the half with all the paved roads.\"  And then, if your country messed up my country, why would I spend my family's savings and risk life and limb to break into your country, the great messer-upper?  One of the blessings of living in Central America is that if you are dissatisfied with your country, there are lots of countries close by you can flee to for refuge. A citizen of Honduras is closer to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Panama, Colombia, and the Bahamas than he is to the U.S.A., and not much further from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil.  Refuge-wise, he's spoiled for choice. Why would he want to come here, to the Great Satan, with all our cruelty and racism and xenophobia and white supremacy and toxic masculinity?  Mrs. Hernandez, the mother in the Time magazine cover story, doesn't seem at all mad about Uncle Sam messing up her country.  Listings of the Four Cardinal Virtues generally put prudence at number one.  In the realm of the National Question\u2014the question of what kind of nation we wish to be, and of what kind of nation we wish our children and grandchildren to inherit\u2014prudence is surely appropriate.  If getting and maintaining a non-messed-up country is as difficult at it seems to be, and as dependent as it seems to be on a healthy supermajority of Ice People, prudence consists in a strict attention to demographic stability and the avoidance of wild demographic experiments.  With all my heart, and with as loud a voice as I can raise, for the sake of my children and their children, I urge prudence upon our nation's leaders.  But what our nation's leaders are actually doing is \u2026 nothing much.  There are plain political reasons for this. Some of them, some of those reasons, have been the motivations behind this week's hysteria over illegal aliens. Others are more longstanding and baked-in to our system.  Our national legislature is quite finely balanced between the two big parties. The Senate is Republican by 51 percent; the House is Republican by 54 percent (55 percent if you factor in currently vacant seats). Under these circumstances, with midterm elections just twenty weeks away, both parties are of course strategizing like crazy.  The Democrats' strategy is to run out the clock: doing nothing either positive or negative while striving to make President Trump look as bad as possible in the eyes of their base\u2014GoodWhite ethnomasochists and racial minorities. The Main Stream Media are totally on board with this, and pushing the strategy for all they're worth.  That's what this week's hysteria has been about. Random comment from a random media shill, this one actually Charles Blow [Email him] at the New York Times June 17th:  Trump is lying, as he often does. This barbaric policy is an outgrowth of his own personal cruelty \u2026 This practice of family separation must end, and Trump and every other politician who was silent about it or worse, endorsed it, must be held to account at the ballot box.[Trump and the Baby Snatchers]  That puts it as plainly as you could want. Trump is an evil person! Vote Democrat!  Godwin's Law\u2014which states, just to remind you, that as an internet discussion thread grows longer, the probability of someone mentioning Hitler approaches certainty\u2014has been much in evidence in this week's hysteria: so much so, in fact, that even some of the Open-Borders people have felt moved to protest.  Here for example was John Podhoretz, an old-school Jewish immigration sentimentalist and race denialist:  Hitler wanted all Jews dead. Trump wants non-Americans who are here in violation of US law out of the United States. Dislike that all you wish. I do. I do not think this is the right policy. But it's not the systematic elimination of the Other. Stop cheapening the Holocaust to score political points, June 22, 2018  Which might be a bit more persuasive if Podhoretz had not himself done a bit of Holocaust-cheapening five months ago when he compared either Presidential advisor Stephen Miller or our own Steve Sailer\u2014it's not clear which\u2014to Joseph Goebbels.  Still, it's a sign of how crazy things have gotten that even Podhoretz, a neocon's neocon, thinks the Godwinization of our public discourse has gone too far.  That's congressional Democrats and their MSM shills. What about congressional Republicans?  Well, there have been signs of sentient life in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Goodlatte Bill was voted down on Thursday, but it got 193 GOP votes, that's 82 percent of the House Republicans who voted\u2014much better than forecast. Praise and blessings from Radio Derb to all 193 of those House Republicans; a pox on the 41 Republican Nays (except those who, like Rep. Steve King, were voting against the Amnesty provision that the bill was trying to trade for patriotic reforms).  Speaker Paul Ryan himself did not vote. This is customary and not at all remarkable.  Ryan does, however, seem to have taken that better-than-expected 193 vote count to heart. He's been working up a bill of his own, a much cuckier, more donor-friendly bill. He'd planned to bring his bill to a vote this week right after Goodlatte's, but that vote has now been postponed to next week so that Ryan can jiggle the bill a bit to make it more acceptable to the 193. [House Rejects Hard-Line Immigration Bill and Delays Vote on Compromise, By Thomas Kaplan and Nicholas Fandos, The New York Times, June 21, 2018]  There is very little prospect that Ryan's jiggling will make this second bill anything other than what it currently seems to be: a huge mass Amnesty for alien scofflaws garnished with some vague, easily-reversed promises on border security and internal enforcement. That's what GOP donors want, and that's what Ryan will give them. After all, six months from now he'll be working for them openly, full-time, as a lobbyist.  The Senate is as usual immigration-shy and effectively inert. Even if Ryan's bill passes the House, it will die in the Senate. Everybody, including Paul Ryan, knows this.  So it's all kabuki theater. Democrats want to go into the midterms saying to their base that the President is Hitler; Republicans want to go in saying to their base that, heck, we know you want something done and we tried to do something, we really did, but there are just too many darn Democrats in Congress to get anything through.  The actual mood of the Republican base seems to be strongly pro-enforcement, even after this MSM blizzard of stories about howling toddlers being ripped from their mothers' arms. The strong vote for the Goodlatte Bill reflects this: GOP congresscritters have been hearing from their constituents.  My own thumbnail gauge of GOP voter sentiment is, as I mentioned last week, the Letters columns of the New York Post, which I have reason to believe actually reflect the feelings of readers of this conventionally center-right newspaper in a not-very-Republican region.  The Post actually ran an editorial about border detentions as the hysteria got under way, taking quite a stern line against President Trump's policy. [Stop breaking up families at the border, June 17, 2018] I waited patiently to see what the Letters column showed.  That editorial ran on Sunday, June 17. Monday, June 18, nothing. Tuesday, June 19, seven letters. Five of the seven were hysterical. The words \"ripping,\" \"ripping,\" \"kidnapping,\" and \"ripped\" showed up in four of the five. Godwin's law of course kicked in, quote from a Manhattan letter-writer: \"I now feel like I'm living in Nazi Germany,\" That's from the heart of New York City, current mayor Comrade Bill \"Honeymoon in Castro's Cuba\" de Blasio.  Even then, though\u2014on Tuesday, as the hysteria was cresting\u2014two of the Post's seven reader letters were non-hysterical. One blamed the illegals for putting their children at risk. Another calmly suggested using FEMA facilities\u2014Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2014to house the detainees.  Friday the Post ran another batch of readers' letters, nine this time. Only one followed the hysterical line. Incredibly, it refrained from invoking Godwin's Law; but it did include the phrase, quote, \"ripped from their mothers' arms,\" The other eight wanted better border control and scoffed at the hysteria. Seven of the eight supported current policy. The eighth opposed it from the right, deploring, \"President Trump's executive order flip-flop,\u201d which the writer blamed on Ivanka and Melania.  I don't say this is definitive, certainly not any kind of scientific survey. Those letters do show, though, that even here in New York\u2014the beating heart of Left-liberal lunacy and Republican cuckery\u2014there are plenty of people not taken in by the hysteria.  I agree, by the way, with that eighth New York Post reader that Trump's Executive Order was a blunder. The policy that caused all the hysteria\u2014separating kids from their parents or pretend-parents and keeping them in HHS facilities for a few days\u2014was perfectly legal, defensible, and humane. What's supposed to happen now? We put the kids in Border Patrol lock-ups? How is that better?  The logic is inescapable. An adult who crosses the border without authorization is liable to arrest and detention, quite rightly so. If there are children with him, those children need to be detained and cared for, too; though since it's the adult who broke the law, not the child, this is a child-care issue, not a law-enforcement issue.  If child-care detention in HHS facilities is unacceptable, and detention of children in Border Patrol lockups with their parents is unthinkable, the only possibility is to let the kids go. So thousands of children\u2014including a lot of teenagers and likely some adults posing as teenagers \u2014with no proper claim to U.S. residence, have gotten it. And when the accompanying adult really is the child's parent, they'll get to stay too.[\u2018Unaccompanied Migrant CHILDREN\u2019 Arrive at NY Airport -Appear to be GROWN MEN With SCRUFFY BEARDS and Shaving Kits (VIDEO), Gateway Pundit, June 23, 2018]  Our courts will make sure of that. Our courts are in fact a big part of the problem. Michelle Malkin many years ago stated the Prime Directive of immigration jurisprudence: \"It ain't over until the alien wins.\" That will probably be the governing factor in the fate of these Central American border-jumpers going forward.  A friend who knows much more about our laws and Constitution than I do tells me that Congress could in fact bar the federal judiciary from considering these cases.  That's nice, supposing my friend is right and I've understood him correctly; but the chance of Congress actually doing anything that imaginative, or that patriotic, is so small you'd need an electron microscope to see it. So this idea is like\u2014to leap to the other end of the cosmic scale\u2014is like the Heat Death of the Universe: kind of interesting, but not actually relevant to anything likely to happen in our lives.  The President could anyway have spared himself all the wrangling his administration's in for with the judiciary, and could also have spared us this last few day's screeching hysteria, by just doing what he was elected to do: build an effective border barrier.  It's not that hard. Israel's done it; Hungary's done it; Saudi Arabia and India have done it. China did it two thousand years ago.  What, you want to tell me we can't do it until Congress appropriates the funds? I don't believe it. I understand about checks and balances, but the President doesn't have that little power. If we can bomb wedding parties in Afghanistan without a Congressional declaration of war, surely we can put up a decent border barrier.  This has been Trump's greatest failure. Those of who voted for him, campaigned for him, and turned out on freezing winter mornings to show our support for him, need to keep telling him this.  Build the damn wall, Mr. President!

                              "text": "From Trump\u2019s bad week to watching the Democrats freak \u2014 and most points in between \u2014 it\u2019s time for a look back at the week that was. Personal Liberty Digest\u00ae presents: The WIRE!  President Donald Trump suffered through what may have been his worst week in the White House when his former minions Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort both hit the wall over tax and financial crimes. Of course, liberals immediately began shrieking about impeachment, as if being a pig who associates with other pigs is an impeachable offense.    \u201cImpeachable? Sure. Convictable? We sure hope not.\u201d  Cohen arranged a hush money payment he didn\u2019t make. Manafort got popped for crimes he committed while Mueller was director of the FBI and Obama was president. How is this going to end the Trump presidency, exactly?    Details are only important to MAGA rubes.  Trump crony David Pecker of tabloid publisher American Media International has reportedly received immunity in return for information he provided to investigators looking into the Michael Cohen case.    How is anyone surprised that a story involving porn stars and playmates also involved a Pecker?  With Manafort and Cohen going down, and Pecker getting immunity, President Trump \u2014 as usual \u2014 took to Twitter to vent his frustration over \u201cflipping,\u201d which he called \u201cunfair.\u201d    Little snitches get bigly stitches.  While liberals cheered the Cohen and Manafort cases as \u201cproof\u201d that Trump is dirty, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that two years of special counseling, and still no Russian collusion, just Trump acting like Bill Clinton. In the interest of fairness, Trump should have to marry Hillary.    He would resign tomorrow.  Even if they manage to impeach Trump, getting 2/3 of the Senate to vote to convict is more of an uphill battle than getting Nana Hilldawg elected. And even if that works out, guess what happens next? Say hello to President Pence.    Didn\u2019t think this one all the way through, did ya, Dems?  Speaking of illegal campaign contributions, given her campaign\u2019s unprecedented violations of campaign finance laws, it\u2019s a damned good thing for Nana Hilldawg that she lost.    It would be plain old weird if she wore her prison jumpsuit in the Oval Office.  Of course, no one seems to notice that paying hush money to a girlfriend may not be an illegal campaign contribution \u2014 or even illegal. But hey, good luck proving it.    Ought to be wrapping up that investigation by the time Ivanka is sworn in for her second term.  Anyone else notice that the \u201cresistance\u201d seems kinda overwrought about throwing Trump out of office? Almost like they still don\u2019t have someone to beat him in 2020.    There\u2019s always \u2014 never mind.  Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions got into it again this week with Trump complaining about Sessions\u2019 lack of control over the Department of Justice and Sessions proclaiming the DoJ wouldn\u2019t be improperly influenced.    One more public spat like this and they\u2019re not going to the prom together.  Liberals were quick to voice their outrage over the murder of Mollie Tibbetts by an illegal alien, whining about pro-border security people \u201cpoliticizing\u201d Tibbetts\u2019 murder. Right\u2026 because politicizing tragedy is wrong.    Up next on CNN: a town hall blaming the NRA for Parkland.  When Senator Elizabeth Warren sees the murder of Mollie Tibbetts, she sees what she calls \u201cthe REAL problem\u201d: so-called \u201cfamily separations\u201d at the U.S. border with Mexico.    Sorry Mollie, Lieawatha says you\u2019re \u201cfake news.\u201d  Liberals ratcheted up the outrage when an illegal alien was grabbed by ICE while taking his wife to the hospital for a c-section. None seemed interested in why ICE arrested the guy who was wanted for skipping out on a warrant for murder.    As we learned from their Tibbetts reactions, illegal aliens\u2019 comfort > human life.  The \u201cresistance\u201d cheered as multiple Democrat Senators have refused to meet with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as if refusing to meet with a guy they already promised to no-vote is brave or noteworthy.    It\u2019s gonna be super awkward when Justice Kavanaugh sits down in front of them at the next State of the Union.  It\u2019s worth noting that the Democrats wouldn\u2019t be throwing such an impotent tantrum if they hadn\u2019t rigged the nomination process themselves.    That high horse looks an awful lot like a petard.  Nana ain\u2019t going away quietly. The 2016 loser announced that she\u2019ll be headlining Democrat fundraisers in Chicago, New York and San Francisco this fall. (But probably not Wisconsin.)    With polls uncertain, Hillary will do her part to boost Republican fortunes in time for midterms.  Hillary isn\u2019t the only Clinton planning to \u201chelp\u201d the Democrats. Chelsea Clinton is saying she\u2019s considering a run for office. Democrats have Clintons like locker rooms have shower mold.    Chelsea 2032: Hey! What\u2019s That Smell?  Disgraced former intelligence analyst Reality Winner was sentenced this week to five years in prison for stealing classified information and mailing it to a media outlet; which serves to remind us all: If you\u2019re gonna leak classified intel, do it from the server in your bathroom.    It makes a big difference.  Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has had enough of the Trump show, whining about Republican refusal to betray the president and claiming the GOP mantra should be \u201cput your head in the sand.\u201d    It\u2019s catchy, but I like the Democrats\u2019 mantra better: \u201cLose.\u201d  And that\u2019s your week in review! For the Personal Liberty Digest\u00ae, I\u2019m Ben Crystal saying, \u201cSee you next week, on The WIRE!\u201d",

                              "text": "In recent years, it has become apparent that the Republican establishment is nearly as rife with the corruption of personal avarice and progressive ideology as the Democratic establishment, if not just as much so. Much of this came to light during the Obama administration, and I was never hesitant to point that out in this space when such evidence came to my attention.  In our quest to drain the Washington swamp and systematically uncovering \u201cswamp monsters\u201d in the course of doing so, it is important that we play no favorites, regardless of what an individual\u2019s station or perceived value might be.  It is well-known amongst informed conservatives and libertarians that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pretty much the poster boy for this sort of corruption. While many of us find his two-faced pretending to conservatism whilst advancing liberal policies odious, as long as he holds his position, we do in fact have to deal with him.  take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? * Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker  Email *  Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

Despite the fact that President Donald Trump and a few stalwart Republican lawmakers in Congress have been obliged to (at least) attempt to gain McConnell\u2019s cooperation on matters of legislative process, if we are to effectively commence the aforementioned swamp draining, we cannot overlook McConnell\u2019s duplicity, nor his Beltway-bred avarice.  To this end, I will speak to the recent story in Breitbart News that detailed the fact McConnell\u2019s in-laws \u2013 the family of his wife, Elaine Chao \u2013 have purchased 10 transoceanic cargo ships from the Chinese government since Chao became transportation secretary. This was first revealed in the New York Times best-seller \u201cSecret Empires \u201d by Peter Schweizer , but the Chao family\u2019s shady dealings and ties to the Chinese government have been known amongst some of us for quite a bit longer.  As reported a few weeks ago, Schweizer\u2019s book also addressed the billion-dollar dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, with the Chinese government, and which may include significant national security concerns for the United States.  While McConnell is an elected official whom we can\u2019t do much about until his constituents tire of him, his wife \u2013 who resembles the hardened brothel owner from the film \u201cBig Trouble in Little China\u201d \u2013 was nominated to her post by Donald Trump in 2016 and confirmed by the Senate in 2017.  You see, this is where the faith of some in Donald Trump as a dedicated swamp-drainer tends to falter. Yes, it is true that Chao has all of the requisite stellar Beltway credentials to serve as secretary of transportation, but those are precisely the sort of credentials that American voters did not want in their president when they elected Trump.  What advantages or lagniappes might the Chao family enjoy given that one of their own just happens to be the U.S. transportation secretary and wife of the Senate majority leader? In the current political climate, we may never know.  During Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, there was the \u201cChinagate\u201d fundraising scandal, which plagued the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign and involved the transfer of America\u2019s most sensitive technology to the Communist Chinese. When Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state during the Obama administration, the decades-long, far-too-cozy ties between the Clintons, Obama and the Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 whose stated goal is to supplant our system of governance with an Islamic one \u2013 came to light.  Lest I be accused of singling out Democrats, I was far less than comfortable with Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, George P. Schultz, serving on the board of Bechtel Group Inc. during that administration. Bechtel is the largest construction contractor in the U.S. but has had far-too-cozy ties to evil regimes, among them the Saudis and Iraq under the late Saddam Hussein. My belief was that Reagan should have demanded Schultz either resign from Bechtel\u2019s board, or resign from his Cabinet post.  So, was Donald Trump unaware that his pick for transportation secretary was a swamp monster with ties to the Communist Chinese? It hardly seems likely, as familiar as Trump is with that nation. Was he unaware that the Chao family came under scrutiny in 2014 after Colombian authorities found 90 pounds of cocaine aboard one of their cargo vessels bound for the Netherlands?  While it is possible that no one in the Chao family had any knowledge whatsoever of the cocaine sequestered aboard their ship, the fact that the stash had a street value of over $30 million does tend to give one pause. That\u2019s a nice chunk of change to have a piece of, even if one is already a billionaire shipping magnate.  It is apathy and the blind trust we placed in those who govern us that brought us to a place of crisis sufficient to take a chance on someone wholly outside the Washington Beltway as president. Considering this, we cannot continue to summarily accept the status quo on the one hand whilst advocating efforts to dismantle it with the other.  Nor can we tolerate the corrupt and nepotistic behavior of those in our government because they happen to be registered Republicans. If our president insists upon enlisting the dubious services of swamp operatives \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 it is up to voters to call him out on it, because no one else will.

                              "text": "The Washington Times\u2019 Charles Hurt appeared on the Tucker Carlson show Wednesday night to discuss how recent events are \"playing right into the hands of Donald Trump.\" He cites the success of radical leftist candidates in recent Democratic primaries and, in particular, the race that everyone is talking about, 28-year-old Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s surprise win over ten-term Congressman Joseph Crowley in New York District 14. It was once thought that Crowley, referred to as the \u201cKing of Queens,\u201d might even become the next Speaker of the House if Democrats regain the House majority in November. Instead, as Trump said, \u201cHe got his a** kicked.\u201d The Democrat's lurch to the left, Hurt believes, will not play out well in the general election.  He compares it to the Tea Party candidates who prevailed in the 2010 Republican primaries, but were too far to the right to win in a general election. An example would be Tea Party Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell's defeat of the more moderate Delaware Congressman Michael Castle in the primary. She lost the general election because she was far too conservative for the state. Prior to the primary, Castle, who had served two terms as governor and nine terms in the House, was considered a shoo-in to beat the Democrat, Chris Coons.  Similar scenarios played out all over the country in the 2010 mid-terms. At one point, it appeared likely that Harry Reid would lose his Senate seat to Tea Party candidate Sharron Angle in Nevada. Instead, he won the race. It was thought that a more moderate, more seasoned candidate could have derailed him.  take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Completing this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.  Throughout the recent New York District 14 primary, Ocasio-Cortez \u201cattacked Crowley for his race saying that, as a white man, he was not fit to represent the district. She explicitly said this election is about race.\u201d  Carlson and Hurt wondered how a candidate could get away with saying that \u201cthe election is about the color of a person\u2019s skin.\u201d  Ocasio-Cortez also ran on abolishing ICE and impeaching Trump. Those may be winning issues in NY 14, but a tough sell elsewhere.  Hurt : Increasingly, it (discussing race) is something that is accepted coming from the left\u2026Ever since the beginning of the whole Tea Party movement, we\u2019ve been waiting for a similar reckoning to hit the Democratic party. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now\u2026These people are communists and that\u2019s a real problem. Democrats are going to have to contend with this and this is not going to be the last sitting Democrat who is going to get ousted by some socialist, who wants free stuff for everybody, who comes out of nowhere.  Tucker : This candidate in Queens ran explicitly against ICE and called for a South African style Truth and Reconciliation Commission to go through the sins of ICE, the human rights abuses. Are you going to see other Democrats run on that same platform?  Hurt : We\u2019re going to see actual mainstream Democrats in Congress pushing this lie about ICE. And, my goodness, what do you expect when they accuse ICE agents and border patrol agents of being like Nazis.  Asked by Carlson if a candidate can win on this platform, Hurt said:  Hurt : Maybe in NY 14, you can win on that platform, but I guarantee you, anywhere else across the country, you\u2019re not going to be able to win on this and all of this plays right into the hands of Donald Trump.  I would argue that Donald Trump got himself reelected this week and it\u2019s because of crazy stuff like this and the Maxine Waters stuff and the haranguing people in public. It\u2019s all playing into Trumps hands.\u201d  The interview clip appears in the following video.  Conservative commentator Michele Malkin questions not only the patriotism of the \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d movement, but also their sanity. Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America party. These are \u201cshrieking radicals that oppose any immigration enforcement.\u201d  She points out that approximately 20 Democratic candidates are running on the Abolish ICE platform, including several sitting Congressmen. There are many others, who aren\u2019t calling for outright abolishment of ICE, but who insist on major changes in immigration law. ICE field offices across the country are under siege and some have been forced to shut down, such as the Portland, OR facility I reported on here, due to protestors. Yet, no party leaders are condemning their actions.  President Trump is now trying to make Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, two of the least popular members of Congress, the faces of the Democratic party, which is a very effective strategy.  The more Trump achieves, the more \u201cunhinged\u201d their rhetoric becomes. In fact, The Republican National Committee has just released one of their best ads ever, based on this theme. Inside of one minute and seven seconds, it provides voters with ten reasons why they should not cast their ballot for a Democrat in November.  \u201cThe Left in 2018: Unhinged\u201d  I agree with Charles Hurt. It\u2019s been a very good week for Donald Trump.",

I was depicted as an arrogant, obnoxious, ruthless British villain. There was just one problem, as I pointed out to Trump in a boardroom exchange that tragically never got aired. \u2018One of us,\u2019 I explained, \u2018is a violent alcoholic who\u2019s been shot by an ex-wife, stabbed in bar-room knife fights, and has a criminal record for a DUI.\u2019 I competed in Donald Trump\u2019s first season of Celebrity Apprentice \u2013 and I was once portrayed as evil, not unlike how Donald has been branded these days Yesterday, Hillary Clinton showed she didn\u2019t get the \u2018rise above the monster\u2019 memo, shrieking herself hoarse (pictured today speaking in North Carolina) I paused for effect. \u2018The other\u2026. is me\u2026. the bad guy.\u2019 Trump roared with laughter. He got the irony, even if viewers never got the chance to. I was reminded of this today as I watched President Obama tear into Trump, branding him a small-brained, star-f***ing, Ku Klux Klan tolerating \u2018loser\u2019 born with a silver spoon in his mouth. It was an astonishingly personal and nasty attack from a man whose own wife Michelle recently declared from atop her lofty moral plinth: \u2018When they go low, we go high.\u2019 Yesterday, Hillary Clinton showed she didn\u2019t get the \u2018rise above the monster\u2019 memo either, shrieking herself hoarse as she once again laid into Trump supporters she recently described as \u2018The Deplorables\u2019. \u2018I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and the anger of people who support Donald Trump,\u2019 she raged. This follows a familiar pattern from Team Clinton as election day draws closer: when in doubt, trash Trump and his followers in the meanest, ugliest, most personal way possible. The mantra seems to be: \u2018When they go low, we plummet even lower.\u2019 A similar mistake was made in Britain during the EU referendum debate when the Remain campaigners belittled and berated the Brexiters in a snide, sneering, superior manner. They lost. The problem for Mrs Clinton as she gallops across the fields of America like a crusading white knight trying to single-handedly save the nation from imminent Armageddon at the hands of Mr Evil is that she\u2019s the Trace Adkins of this battle. In other words, she ain\u2019t no saint herself. Her supporters don\u2019t accept this of course. To them, Hillary is a vestal political virgin of unimpeachable integrity. \u2018Why would I want to criticise her?\u2019 a female Clinton-ite actress indignantly asked me on Twitter yesterday. \u2018She\u2019s up against a mad man. Compared to him, she\u2019s bathed in golden light.\u2019 It was the kind of thing I\u2019d expect Tom Cruise to say in defence of his beloved basket case Scientologists. Yet as I write this, Clinton is facing potential FBI criminal investigations on two fronts. One is the re-opened case of her ongoing email scandal, this time centering on the contents of sexting pervert Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. The second, according to the Washington Post, is an investigation into an alleged \u2018pay-or-play\u2019 operation Hillary ran out of the State Department that favoured donors to the Clinton Foundation charity. At the root of it lies a central charge that the Clintons have cynically and greedily exploited political power and status to enrich themselves, under the convenient protective umbrella of their Foundation. Big sponsors have been repeatedly \u2018invited\u2019 to donate big sums to the Foundation, then also donate big sums to the personal fortunes of Bill or Hillary in the form of cash, holidays, private jets and other benefits. On the face of it, this seems like a prima facie case of potential corruption. Yet the Post further reports the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation has been held up by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, to the fury of many in the FBI. This is the same Loretta Lynch who Bill Clinton hijacked for a 30-minute conversation on a private airstrip days before the original FBI email investigation verdict exonerating his wife was made public. We can all draw our own conclusions, none of them I suspect very pretty. I know from first-hand experience there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch with the Clintons. There is no such thing as a free lunch with the Clintons. I know from my own dealings it\u2019s quid-pro-quo: Bill would scratch my back if I scratched his I\u2019ve interviewed Bill Clinton twice, for CNN. On both occasions, the request was only granted once I had agreed to moderate a panel for the former president at his annual Clinton Global Initiative event in aid of Clinton Foundation. It was a strict quid-pro-quo: Bill would scratch my back if I scratched his. So I scratched away, as do many other TV journalists each year who want an interview with him. There\u2019s a similar pattern to almost everything in Planet Clinton: they trade favours. But when that trade involves millions of dollars raked into personal bank accounts on the back of charity donations, it stinks to high heaven. \u2018Trace\u2019 Clinton should get off her high horse, before she gets a nosebleed. \nH/T \u2013 DailyMail \nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.

                              "text": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s health has been the subject of\u00a0intense speculation during the 2016 presidential campaign, in part because the candidates\u2019 fitness to serve is of valid concern to voters, and in part because it was seized upon by her opponents\u00a0as a way to undermine her candidacy. While\u00a0presidential candidates aren\u2019t required by law to release information about their medical histories,\u00a0it has become routine for them to do so, and both Democratic candidate Clinton and Republican candidate Trump have provided physician\u2019s statements attesting to their good health. Despite this, rumors\u00a0to the effect that Clinton is suffering from\u00a0some kind of serious, undisclosed\u00a0medical condition continue to run rampant. The statement released by Clinton\u2019s\u00a0personal doctor, Lisa Bardack, MD of Mount Kisco, New York, lists past bouts of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots), an elbow fracture, and a concussion, plus\u00a0ongoing conditions of hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies. Though her family medical history includes heart disease and stroke, a cardiac screening was conducted in 2015 and came back negative. So did a cancer screening. \u201c[Clinton] is in excellent physical condition,\u201d Bardack concluded, \u201cand fit to serve as President of the United States.\u201d We note that Dr. Bardack\u2019s assessment (which she reaffirmed in writing in August 2016) was based on an actual physical examination of the candidate\u00a0\u2014 not a minor consideration, given that much of the speculation about Clinton\u2019s health has been fueled by \u201cdiagnoses\u201d from afar by physicians who have never shaken her\u00a0hand, much less conducted a thorough examination of her. Media personality \u201cDr. Drew\u201d Pinsky, for\u00a0one, delivered a rambling assessment of Clinton\u2019s health\u00a0on a radio talk show in which he repeatedly claimed\u00a0he had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about her medical fitness \u2014\u00a0based on nothing more than having read\u00a0Dr. Bardack\u2019s two-page statement. He was roundly criticized by other medical professionals for doing so. While Pinsky\u2019s speculation was that Clinton suffers from\u00a0brain damage, a\u00a0later\u00a0entrant in the armchair\u00a0diagnosis field, Dr. Ted Noel of Orlando, Florida, claimed\u00a0he could\u00a0prove\u00a0via cherry-picked news articles, photos, and video clips of the candidate that she likely suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease. Noel\u2019s 16-minute video, titled \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s Illness Revealed,\u201d starts with this disclaimer: I am a medical doctor with 36 years of experience, but I am not Hillary Clinton\u2019s treating physician, so I can\u2019t claim that what I\u2019m about to tell you is a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, at the end of\u00a0a litany\u00a0of hearsay, conjecture, and conspiracy theories Noel\u00a0states, flat out: \u201cHillary Clinton has advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201d We\u2019ll examine\u00a0some of his evidence and arguments momentarily, but first, here\u2019s what we know about Dr. Ted Noel himself: \u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s incapable of recognizing symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, but consider this:\u00a0If your primary care doctor suspected you had Parkinson\u2019s and wished to refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis, it would be to a neurologist, not an anesthesiologist. How accurate and reliable can such a medical diagnosis be? As we noted in the case of Dr. Drew Pinsky above, most medical professionals consider this inappropriate behavior on the part of a physician, if not downright unethical. Would you accept a diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease on the basis of a few minutes of video watched by a doctor you\u2019ve never met? In fact, Noel\u2019s assessment is nakedly partisan in intent, despite this feigned\u00a0disavowal that he makes toward the end of the video: Let us not confuse medical and political issues here. I\u2019m firmly opposed to Hillary Clinton on political and moral grounds, but this discussion has been about her medical condition. That\u2019s\u00a0after\u00a0Noel has described Clinton as \u201ca politician who lies about everything,\u201d and after he has made this statement about her\u00a0\u201cmedical\u201d condition: Our president must always be strong and clear-headed. If she is not doing the job, then who will? Will it be Huma Abedin, who has been associated with Muslim causes and directly involved in the Clinton Foundation corruption? Will it be Bill Clinton, who is at the center of the Clinton Foundation corruption? \u2026 Or will Vice President Tim Kaine take over? Of course, then the Clintons would lose their juice. What is the above, if not precisely \u201cconfusing medical and political issues\u201d? We\u2019re not just throwing that out\u00a0as a dismissive epithet; we mean\u00a0he is a conspiracy theorist. The\u00a0fundamental premise of this video is that Hillary Clinton and everyone around her\u00a0\u2014 her doctor, her family and friends, the\u00a0inner circle of her campaign, and the Democratic National Committee\u00a0\u2014 know full well that she (supposedly) has an incapacitating disease and are willfully concealing that fact from the public to gain power. Let\u2019s move on to consider the \u201cevidence\u201d Dr. Ted Noel uses to support his claim that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson\u2019s disease. According to a conspiracy web site, an unnamed Secret Service whistleblower revealed that\u00a0Clinton has\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s. Note well, however, Noel is here citing a secondhand report from a single, unnamed source published on the Alex Jones web site Infowars.com, which at one time or another has pushed every conspiracy theory known to humankind, from\u00a0allegations that President George W. Bush authorized the 9/11 attacks (which, by the way, weren\u2019t really\u00a0\u201cattacks\u201d according to this site, but rather \u201ccontrolled demolitions\u201c) to the claim that\u00a0President Barack Obama forged his own\u00a0birth certificate. Noel says\u00a0WikiLeaks released U.S. State Department e-mails which show that Clinton asked aides to research new Parkinson\u2019s disease drugs. Not true. Among the messages WikiLeaks released was\u00a0one e-mail received by Clinton that contained information about Provigil, a prescription drug described in that message\u00a0as follows: Provigil is used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder (sleepiness during scheduled waking hours among people who work at night or on rotating shifts). It is also often prescribed to treat excessive sleepiness in patients with Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, it has also gained a following among students, truckers, and others who want to stay awake for extended periods of time. In simpler terms, Provigil is used to treat\u00a0excessive sleepiness. Sometimes\u00a0that excessive sleepiness is in Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Other times it\u2019s\u00a0in people suffering from sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or shift work sleep disorder. Is\u00a0it accurate to describe Provigil as \u201ca new Parkinson\u2019s disease drug\u201d? No. Are there\u00a0Wikileaks e-mails indicating that Clinton specifically asked staffers to research Parkinson\u2019s drugs? No (check\u00a0for yourself). Noel attempts to link three separate incidents over a period of years in which Clinton fainted and/or fell, implying that the stated explanations for each\u00a0hid the \u201creal\u201d cause, Parkinson\u2019s disease. 31 January 2005: Clinton said she was feeling \u201cqueasy\u201d as she began a speech in upstate New York and later fainted at the podium. Secret Service agents broke her fall, so she was unhurt. \u201cOddly, she did not seek medical attention,\u201d Noel claims, but,\u00a0even more oddly,\u00a0an image of a\u00a0CNN article reporting that she did\u00a0receive medical attention at scene from a doctor in the audience\u00a0flashes on screen at the exact moment he says it. The physician,\u00a0Dr. Stephanie Pincus, said Clinton had been suffering from a GI virus for at least a day, and needed fluids and a rest. Nothing mysterious. 17 June 2009: Clinton fell and broke her elbow on her way from the elevator to her car in\u00a0the basement of\u00a0the State Department. Noel again uses the word \u201codd\u201d to describe the incident, wondering why Secret Service agents weren\u2019t able to break her fall, as they had done in the previous incident. \u201cShe would have to fall at a distance from them with no warning,\u201d he opines. And, indeed, according to news reports, she slipped and fell\u00a0\u2014 obviously without warning. Nothing mysterious. 17 December 2012: Clinton fainted in her home due to dehydration and struck her head, causing a concussion. \u201cBut again, this is very odd,\u201d Noel says. \u201cTo strike your head requires a complete loss of protective reflexes.\u201d Which, not very oddly at all, is precisely what occurs when you faint and lose consciousness. \u201cBeing wobbly from dehydration won\u2019t do this,\u201d he argues. But no one is talking about \u201cbeing wobbly.\u201d Clinton fainted; she lost consciousness, fell, and hit her head. And dehydration is frequently cited as a cause of fainting. Nothing mysterious. Why does Noel try so hard to make it seem there was something inexplicable about each of these incidents? Here\u2019s why: \u201cIf Hillary has Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d Noel says, \u201call three falls make sense\u201d\u00a0\u2014 as if they\u2019re impossible to make sense of without the Parkinson\u2019s explanation. But, as we\u2019ve just shown, that is not the case. \u201cEarly in 2016,\u201d Noel continues, \u201cHillary\u2019s problems started to be really obvious. Videos of odd physical movements and brain freezes became common. This is consistent with the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease into its later and more troublesome stages. \u201cThe first picture to surface is Hillary being helped up a set of porch steps in February. Once again, if she froze while climbing the steps, the people right next to her could catch her and keep her from injury.\u201d  But there\u2019s no reason to suppose that she\u00a0\u201cfroze.\u201d The original caption on this Getty Images photo, dated\u00a024 February 2016,\u00a0says she slipped while going up the stairs. Noel then directs our attention to\u00a0a video clip in which Clinton is seen nodding repetitively as other people speak:  \u201cTo most people, that was just odd,\u201d says Noel, once again employing his favorite adjective. \u201cBut if we think about Parkinson\u2019s disease, it\u2019s obvious. This is a head nodding tremor.\u201d No, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a tic Hillary Clinton has had for a long time, since at least the early \u201990s, usually in evidence when she\u2019s listening to another public speaker. Here\u2019s an example from 1993:  \u00a0 Noel next shows a video of a Clinton campaign rally on 2 April 2016, in which he claims she uses certain \u201ctechniques to hide tremors in her hands.\u201d The first is placing her hand flat on her chest, and the second is a gesture in which her fingers come together to form a sort of point \u2014 both of which he claims she does to prevent the audience from noticing tremors. But, in fact, if you watch more of the video than the few seconds Noel shows us, and with the audio turned on, you see that she\u2019s clearly using these gestures to emphasize verbal statements, and to suggest to the audience\u00a0that they\u2019re heartfelt. Plus, she transitions easily in and out of these hand gestures, never once displaying anything like a \u201ctremor\u201d when she\u2019s not using them. Noel next presents a series of images and clips, including\u00a0every conspiracy theorist\u2019s favorite Hillary Clinton video\u00a0\u2014 the same one that they have previously tried to pass off\u00a0as an \u201cepileptic seizure\u201d\u00a0\u2014 and claims, again, that the real explanation is Parkinson\u2019s. Here\u2019s the famous video:  This is\u00a0\u201canother Parkinson\u2019s disease problem,\u201d Noel claims, \u201cbut this time it\u2019s from the treatment, not the disease. It\u2019s an example of Parkinson\u2019s disease levadopa-induced dyskinesia, or PD LID.\u201d But no, it\u2019s not. As we reported previously, the journalists surrounding her at that moment saw nothing amiss or disturbing in her actions. Associated Press reporter Lisa Lerer described it as follows: As an Associated Press reporter who\u2019s spent more than a year covering her candidacy, I was there for her appearance. After she ordered herself a \u201ccold chai,\u201d my colleagues and I shouted some questions, mostly about Clinton\u2019s recent meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Perhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume, Clinton responded with an exaggerated motion, shaking her head vigorously for a few seconds. Video of the moment shows me holding out my recorder in front of her, laughing and stepping back in surprise. After the exchange, she took a few more photos, exited the shop and greeted supporters waiting outside.",

                              "text": "\u00a9 Alex Wong/Getty Images Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell hold a news briefing during the 2018 House & Senate Republican Member Conference on February 1, 2018 at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.  President Donald Trump is making a fresh -- if unexpected -- push for some gun law reforms following a tragic mass shooting last week in Florida, but it's not clear they will be embraced by Republican leaders on Capitol Hill nor rank-and-file conservatives who have long stood against diminishing gun rights.  House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have said little publicly since a former student massacred 17 people at a high school in Parkland about what Congress could do to address the epidemic of school shootings with legislation to reduce gun violence.  In the wake of these types of tragedies, both Republican leaders regularly tout their longstanding positions that enforcing existing gun laws and addressing mental health issues -- not imposing new limits to gun ownership -- should be the focus.  With the GOP majority in the House, and potentially even the Senate, at risk in November's midterm elections, any move by Ryan or McConnell to alienate pro-gun rights base voters -- who they need to be enthusiastic and show up in large numbers at the polls -- is politically tricky and not one they are ready to take.  In addition, the vast majority of GOP lawmakers, who are out of town for a week long recess, oppose most gun control measures and are not pressing their leaders for action.  Trump has repeatedly insisted in recent days he wants to \"get something done\" to address safety in schools.  \"Unlike for many years where people sitting in my position did not take action -- they didn't take proper action, they took no action at all -- we're going to take action,\" Trump said during a meeting with law enforcement officials at the White House, when the President also offered support for raising the legal age to purchase guns, getting rid of bump fire stocks, a controversial gun accessory that allows it to fire more rapidly, and focusing on mental health reforms.  But Trump's shifting positions on gun proposals make it difficult for congressional Republicans to know whether they would get any political cover with a base that continues to stand by core beliefs to protect the Second Amendment. Something the President says he backs today could easily be reversed in a new tweet tomorrow.  If Trump truly wants to have the GOP-led House and Senate pass these reforms, he will need to make a sustained push and be prepared to use his political capital to get it done over the objections of powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association.  RELATED: NRA chief accuses Democrats of pushing 'socialist' agenda in wake of Florida shooting  National polls show that a majority of Americans do support some targeted gun control measures, such as beefing up the background check system, but many GOP lawmakers say they are not feeling any pressure from voters in solidly red districts or states back home. One thing they do hear from their constituents, many of whom are single-issue voters, is that they will oppose those who change the laws.  Immediately following the shooting, Ryan argued it wasn't appropriate to wade into another divisive debate, but instead called for unity for those affected.  \"This is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings,\" he told reporters a day after the events unfolded at a press conference on Capitol Hill. \"We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together. This House, and the whole country, stands with the Parkland community.\"  Few House Republicans pressed for any legislative fixes. Moderate Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who is in one of the most competitive House districts, has pressed for a floor vote on his bipartisan bill to ban bump stocks, the tool that can be used to make a semi-automatic gun perform like an automatic weapon, and supports a bill to allow federal research on gun violence. Another House GOP member, Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York, called for hearings.  A day after the Parkland shooting, McConnell took to the Senate floor to condemn the vicious act, praise the heroism of first responders and send prayers to the victims. But he made no mention of a need for a legislative response -- one dealing with curbs on guns or other root causes of these crimes, such as mental health.  \"To say that such brutal, pointless violence is unconscionable is an understatement,\" the Kentucky Republican said. \"Schools should be places where children can learn, and faculty and staff can work, without fear of violence.\"  The top GOP senator is keenly aware there is not much appetite in his largely conservative conference for even the modest reforms Trump appears to be embracing, much less the sweeping gun law changes many Democrats champion.  Fiery comments from NRA chief Wayne LaPierre, at a conservative gathering outside Washington, illustrate why.  \"The elites don't care not one whip about America's school system and school children,\" LaPierre told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday. \"Their goal is to eliminate the second amendment and our firearms freedoms, so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.\"  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer responded.  \"The NRA is once again spewing pathetic, out of touch ideas, blaming everything but guns,\" the Democratic leaders said in a statement. \"The real test of President Trump and the Republican Congress is not words and empathy, but action. Will President Trump and the Republicans finally buck the NRA and get something done? Could this time be different?\"  Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a longtime opponent of gun control measures, publicly signaled he was revising his own positions at a CNN town hall on Wednesday night -- coming out in favor of banning gun sales to 18-year-olds who can now buy rifles, and potentially limiting the size of ammunition clips. One retiring lawmaker, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, announced he was working on a bill to up the age for those purchasing guns to 21, but there has been no rush from other Republicans to jump on board or call for votes.  RELATED: 6 things Marco Rubio said at the CNN town hall that made news in the US gun debate  Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, pointed to the legislation to fix the National Instant Background Check System, also called NICS, that the House approved in December, after another mass shooting in Texas exposed holes in the system that failed to flag a former service member to the database for his record of domestic violence. The bill passed narrowly because all except six House Democrats opposed the measure it was paired with, a bill to loosen gun restrictions to allow those with permits to carry concealed weapons to legally travel with those firearms to other states.  The unusual public profile of those high school students who survived the shooting and the increased public pressure had House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi point to their role as a \"tipping point\" in the debate over gun legislation.  \"They are doing a historic thing and I think they will make a big difference -- channeling their grief, their sorrow, their anger really, to save lives,\" Pelosi said, adding that \"all we are asking for is the speaker is to give us a vote. We believe here is bipartisan support for improving the background check bill.\"  But the response from top Hill Republicans leaders is similar to the ones they have had in recent mass shootings -- in Las Vegas, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in Orlando, Florida. Five years after the stunning murder of elementary school children and their teachers in Newtown, Connecticut, Congress returns to the same debate over and over.  The wide gulf in ideological views of the two parties has not changed, and the cautious response from GOP leaders continue to reflect that dynamic. The only force that might be able to change it is Trump himself. If the President decides to fully embrace the reforms he is touting, he might be able to get congressional Republicans to buy in.

                              "text": "This is a rush transcript from \"Special Report with Bret Baier,\" May 8, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When I make promises, I keep them. I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.  The fact is this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.  In the meantime, powerful sanctions will go into full effect. If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. Swift reaction. European allies releasing a statement together. \"It is with regret and concern that we, the leaders of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, take note of President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States of America from the JCPOA. Together we emphasize our continuing commitment to that agreement. This agreement remains important for our shared security. We urge the U.S. to ensure that the structures that the JCPOA can remain intact, and to taking action which obstructs it full implementation by all other parties to the deal,\" saying essentially they are negotiating further.  Not all countries sharing that. Saudi Arabia tweeting out, \"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia fully supports the measures taken by the president of the United States with regards to the JCPOA. We always had reservations with regards to sunset clauses, ballistic missiles program, and Iran's support for terrorism in the region.\" Similar statements coming from the UAE, Bahrain, the Gulf allies, and of course Israel.  Let's bring in our panel: Matt Schlapp, contributor with The Hill; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics and host of \"No Labels Radio\" on Sirius XM, and Eli Lake, columnist for Bloomberg View.  Eli, looking at looking at across the board the world reaction, your take on this and the hopes that, perhaps, you heard the secretary of treasury say there may be a renegotiation in the offing?  ELI LAKE, BLOOMBERG VIEW: There is also the period of 90 and180 days for the re-imposition of the sanctions. There are now negotiations that I guess have been announced between Iran and the European allies. And so far there has not been any kind of clear statements from the Iranians as to saying that they are going to begin enriching beyond the limits on uranium or building up their program, or kicking out inspectors.  All of that is pretty good. And I think in some ways it could be a continuation of the strategy that Trump has pursued really since the beginning of his presidency, which is to try to renegotiate a better deal.  But there is a paradox also in what he said today which is that he really made a very clear statement of solidarity with the Iranian people. And the question is, if Trump negotiates a bargain with the Iranian regime, where does that leave the Iranian people? I think now is a perfect opportunity for Trump to begin thinking about ways to support the democracy movement which has been gaining momentum really since late December in Iran.  BAIER: Right, exactly, those protests in December and January essentially about the weakening economy in Iran. Here is the president of Iran reacting to this announcement after President Trump spoke.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HASSAN ROUHANI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Tonight we witness an important historic experience. The same thing that we have said and repeated for 40 years has happened. Iran is a country that is loyal to its commitments, and the U.S. is a country that never sticks to its commitments.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: Matt, your thought on that? And you hear it not only obviously from the Iranians but other opponents of this action, saying if the U.S. can't keep its international deals, how does any country believe that the U.S. can keep agreements?  MATT SCHLAPP, THE HILL: Right. And of course there is no future between an American bilateral relationship with the Mullahs in Iran. We have to look past the Mullahs in Iran to the future. And I agree with Eli completely. It's about the Iranian people who in many ways are aligned like no other country in the region to actually be in a position where they could be allied with us on several key issues. So it's about looking past the Mullahs. It's about weakening the Mullahs. Unfortunately we will never get the billions of dollars back that they got at the beginning of this arrangement with President Obama, but this does knock the second big pillar out of the Obama legacy. The Iran nuclear agreement is dead.  Now it can be negotiated, there are ways in which it transitions, but the fundamental premise of it is dead. And I'd have to say one other thing. When you have John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in there staffing the president to fulfill his promises, great things can happen.  BAIER: A.B., you hear some Democrats out there saying this was the wrong move because the next step is not set in stone yet. We don't know the way frankly. And they are comparing it to Obamacare and repeal and replace where there wasn't that next step. But here are some Democrats about this deal as it came to pass.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)  SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: We should not go forward with this agreement.  SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D-N.J.: The whole purpose of our negotiation was to ensure that there would be no pathway for Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability. And this deal doesn't achieve that.  REP. ELIOT ENGEL, D-N.Y.: I've said more times than I can count that I opposed the deal when it was announced. I voted against it on the House floor.  (END VIDEO CLIPS)  BAIER: Obviously, A.B., they are all saying different things now. What about this move today?  A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Bret, this was a flawed agreement from day one, and there were critics on both sides. That's perfectly clear. Right now there are senior members on Capitol Hill, House Armed Services Committee chairman, Republican senior members of the -- sorry, of the Foreign Affairs Committee, senior members of the House Armed Services Committee who are Republicans, very worried about the fact that you get out of this deal and you are left in a perilous place. Very difficult. It makes the challenge with North Korea much more difficult, and it creates a whole host of problems and consequences in the years to come.  It might have allowed for time for the kind of democracy-building and fighting for freedom that Eli Lake wrote so eloquently about today. It might have helped us keep our word with our allies, an area where we are really struggling because we actually don't have a new NAFTA deal. President Macron of France said getting out of this would be insane because there's really nothing left in its place.  I think that these next critical days and weeks are going to tell us whether or not he can actually keep Iran at the table, and whether our European allies can keep them from some kind of proliferation activity and keep them at the table. And if President Trump can end up renegotiating something, that will be a masterstroke. As of now we're just going to have to wait and see what they are willing to give.  BAIER: Part of this speech was to say, here's your opportunity, Iran. This deal was not working. You could still negotiation it. But Eli, very quickly, at the same time you have Secretary of State Pompeo on the ground in North Korea. Who knows, he could come home with three Americans as part of laying the groundwork for this, what is supposed to be a locked in meeting. Put the juxtaposition of those two things.  LAKE: I actually think what Trump did today could help in North Korea because it shows that he is willing to defy establishment, foreign policy Washington, and impose crippling sanctions over the objection of his closest allies and everything else.  I argued in columns that he should wait it out, and in some ways if the North Koreans are looking at that, I think they might say to themselves, we don't necessarily want to cross the sky. We are in good graces now. Imagine what happens if these negotiations don't work out. It could be perilous for us. That's one calculus. I think it's really hard to predict what Kim Jong-un will do. I don't think any intelligence agency really can get inside of his head. But I do think there could be this benefit of it which is that Trump is a disruptor, and he is willing to do things which other adversaries did not think was possible, and that could be a benefit in the context of North Korean negotiations.  BAIER: That's 100 percent true. Panel, thank you.  Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

                              "text": "Las Vegas, NV \u2014 For seven months, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has been caught lying, railroaded journalists, and done everything in their power to keep the facts on what happened on 1 October from ever reaching the public. The department\u2019s desire to keep the information secret was so overwhelming that they fought its release all the way to the Nevada Supreme Court. On Friday, the court rejected the police department\u2019s bid to keep the records secret and they are now forced to hand everything over.  On Wednesday, the department began releasing footage from the officers\u2019 body camera as they entered Stephen Paddock\u2019s suite in Mandalay Bay on the night of the shooting. Not surprisingly, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced on Tuesday that the first officer into the room that night, Levi Hancock, did not activate his camera.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how this footage will be played in the media, but I want to warn you, if you are a survivor or a family who lost a loved one, you should know the video from this concert is disturbing and graphic,\u201d he said.  take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the footage is just a slice of the many body camera clips and 911 calls the department has been ordered to release in response to a lawsuit brought by the Review-Journal and other media outlets.  \u201cWhat is seen on those videos in no way changes the facts that we were able to clarify for you shortly after the crime,\u201d Lombardo said at a Tuesday news conference, as he refused to answer any questions from reports.  Lombardo attempted to claim that his department didn\u2019t want to release the footage in an effort \u201cto protect the victims and their families of this incident,\u201d Lombardo said.  \u201cI want the community to know the release of the videos, 911 and documents will have a significant impact on the victims of this tragedy,\u201d he said.  However, the victims are the some of ones who are demanding the information be released as part of a massive lawsuit.  \u201cNow that it is facing having to follow the law and produce records, Metro is suggesting that the media is trying to victimize the community,\u201d Review-Journal attorney Maggie McLetchie said. \u201cThe truth is that the community still has many unanswered questions about the police response to 1 October, and it has a right to assess what happened for itself. The quest for transparency and accountability is about making sure we, as a community, do everything we can to uncover the truth and avoid future tragedies.\u201d  After shifting blame to the victims for not being transparent, Lombardo then claimed that they simply didn\u2019t have the manpower to release the records.  \u201cTransparency is not a burden for government agencies,\u201d Review-Journal Executive Editor Glenn Cook said, negating that claim. \u201cIt is a legal obligation that is essential to the preservation of the public\u2019s trust.\u201d  Indeed it is.  The video was released and the Associated Press issued the following statement:  Las Vegas police have released some officer body-camera video from the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Videos made public Wednesday are expected to show what two officers found entering a 32nd-floor hotel room where Stephen Paddock unleashed gunfire on a concert last October. Police say he killed 58 people and injured hundreds more before killing himself as authorities closed in. The footage represents a sample of hundreds of hours of body-camera recordings that police say don\u2019t answer why Paddock opened fire. The Associated Press and other media outlets sued to obtain videos, 911 recordings, evidence logs and interview reports. Authorities say more will be released in coming weeks.  As the video shows, officers appear to be outside Paddock\u2019s suite and a loud bang or gunshot is heard.  \u201cRifles up, move up\u201d an officer can be heard saying at one point in the video.  \u201cCheck under the bed,\u201d another officer orders later in the video.  According to the Review-Journal, the clips come from two different canine officers, Sgt. Joshua Bitsko and David Newton, police said.

                              "text": "On Tuesday's \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Fox News with Laura Ingraham, the host said what many of us have been thinking should have been done a long time ago and that is the Republicans should put their money where their mouths are and stand on the principles they claim to believe in, yet consistently and cowardly cave to political pressure and fund them.  Among some of those things they claim to be against are Obamacare, abortion and illegal immigration. Yet, every single one of those things and more are being funded in the Republican omnibus bill.  By the way, all of those things are unconstitutional spending under our Constitution.  Titling her commentary, \"Washington's real March Madness,\" Ingraham said that people's eyes glaze over because they are sick and tired of hearing about such nonsense.  \"What you need to know, it is a legislative scan because it involves packaging a lot of the federal government\u2019s smaller spending bills into one gargantuan bill,\" she told her audience. \"Then the whole thing can be passed with only a single vote in both the House and the Senate. So long gone are the days of the so-called regular order when appropriations were done the sensible way. Department by department, a lot more transparent that way with each bill being considered separately.\"  \"Under that scenario, Congress and the voters who elected them have more opportunities to either strip out the waste and fund only essential priorities,\" she added. \"It makes sense, right? For years, we have heard leaders in both parties pledged to return to regular order, yet nothing ever happens.\"  \"And it is backed to these mind-numbing continuing resolutions, omnibus nightmares, and shutdown threats, and the result is usually a last-minute budget-busting cramdown,\" Ingraham continued. \"Sure enough, as spring kicks off, here they go again, and it\u2019s really ugly.\"  Of course, establishment Republicans continue spending like there is no tomorrow due to the political pressure brought by the media and Democrats. In some sense, a lot of us would rather they just took their jersey off and join the other team in the open rather than in the shadows to be honest.  That's not going to happen because they give the appearance that they are on our side. In other words, RINOs are controlled opposition, and yes, they are controlled.  Ingraham then rolled several clips of what she was talking about. Here's the transcript.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: They insist on poison pills and the rest. Hopefully, they will get serious, and we can get this done before it is the 23rd of March. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This budget had to be finished. They wanted to add 160, 170 poison pill amendments, none of which would ever survive a vote on their own on the floor. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Democrats and Republicans have worked together to reject many of the poison bill pill riders from President Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Meanwhile, conservatives are in revolt, because they are free of all the old sequestration cap and big shocker, it increases spending. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This idea that all the bills come together in one big, what we call an omnibus \u2014 ominous might be a better word. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are looking at a trillion plus dollar deficit perhaps as early as this October when the numbers come out. You know that is under a Republican administration. We need to do better. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have gotten this bad habit of thinking money here is free. It falls from the heavens and money is free. It is not. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I love that. This means Republicans will need, of course, Democratic votes to pass my pass the measure in both chambers and this means more add-ons, more giveaways, more junk. It is a total mess. Do you remember what Trump promised? He promised to cut spending, to defund boondoggles, and, yes, to drain the swamp. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s two illegal executive amnesties and when he defied federal law and the Constitution. The Trump administration will cancel all federal funding for sanctuary cities. We will end illegal immigration, keep the drugs from pouring into our communities. We are not going to allow them to are not going to fund as long as we have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But as of tonight, it looks like the stuff that should be funded by the Republican majority won\u2019t be touched at all. Planned Parenthood, sanctuary cities, Obama\u2019s executive amnesties, and this is my favorite, almost a billion dollars for a tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. It is a disguised earmark for Chuck Schumer. Nice going, Chuck and two of the most liberal states in America benefit. And that is the short list. It passes for a law. This Freddy Krueger-like omnibus bill will include over a trillion dollars in spending, $1.3 trillion.  She then concluded that the bill will most assuredly pass with little if no debate or scrutiny.  \"My friends, this is just sheer madness,\" Ingraham said. \"It is time to stand on principle without fear of a government shutdown. It is time to educate the public about how both parties got off-board.\"  \"Yes, you have to compromise if necessary, but with full transparency, and, if possible, not on the core issues,\" she concluded. \"You are the majority, after all. Start really helping President Trump drain the swamp. Don\u2019t add to it. You\u2019ll do the country good, and you just might surprise all experts in November.\"  On that last part, I would like to ask Ms. Ingraham exactly what those core issues that can't be compromised are because I don't see any appeal to limited constitutional spending which would eliminate a lot more spending than that which is most controversial and apparently unconstitutional. It would eliminate all spending that supports the unconstitutional agencies and programs of the central government along with the welfare programs and empire building that we have been engaged in keeping up for decades.  The fact that these politicians keep their power by indebting the American people through unconstitutional spending just demonstrates how corrupt DC has become and if we cannot clean it up, then we need to start petitioning the states to abolish it, just like Jefferson said, and start anew. And make no mistake, Republicans are just as much a part of the problem of unconstitutional spending as the Democrats.  The only people who truly fear a government shutdown are the politicians in DC, not the people.",

                              "text": "Adapted from the latest Radio Derb, available exclusively on VDARE.com  If you followed the recent hysteria about our cruelty to illegal alien children on non-Main Stream Media, you'll be familiar with the depth of nonsense and dishonesty behind it all.  You'll know that the policy causing all the shrieking and fainting has been in place for years, long before Donald Trump showed up. You'll have seen the old clips from not-that-many years ago of Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and both of the Clintons telling us what a great evil illegal immigration is and how we need to take a strong stand against it.  You've probably also heard the numbers. You know that of the 12,000 minors detained in the six weeks of our zero-tolerance policy, only 2,000 were actually with a person claiming to be a parent. That's seventeen percent. You probably suspect, as I and Attorney General Sessions do, that if DNA testing were to be applied, that percentage would drop into low single figures.  You likely know that Mexico, through which these Central American invaders passed, has a well-equipped U.S. embassy and nine, count 'em nine, consulates scattered across that country from Yucatan in the south to Tijuana in the north. Any Central American seeking asylum in the U.S.A. could apply at any of those places, without any fear of being separated from his children.  You probably also know that Mexico is a nation addled with criminality and corruption. Much of what happens there is dictated by crime syndicates who depend on smuggling narcotics into the U.S.A. Those syndicates obviously have a keen interest in keeping our Border Patrol busy with other matters\u2014like, for example, detaining and processing illegal border-crossers.  As of last Friday, you're probably acquainted with the backstory behind Time magazine's current cover picture of a weeping tot who, according to Time, had been ripped from her mother's arms.  The true story\u2014uncovered by the British press, of course, not by our own worthless hacks\u2014is that the child comes from a comfortable middle-class family in Honduras; that the child's mother long fantasized about living in the U.S.A.; and that she at last acted on her fantasy, paying six thousand dollars to people traffickers and heading north without telling her husband, who is left in Honduras with their other three children, aged fourteen to six.[ Honduran father reveals daughter was never separated from her mother, By Daniel Bates and Karen Ruiz , Daily Mail, June 23, 2018]  The husband tells us that to the best of his knowledge child and mother have not been separated \u2026 though child and father obviously have, by several hundred miles, at the mother's initiative.  This whole thing, this whole hysteria, is in other words bogus from top to bottom, just like all the other Progressive hysterias of recent years: Charlottesville, Russian election meddling, Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, the savage racism of asking for voter I.D. at polling stations.  If you pay any attention at all, if you care at all about actual facts, if you're willing to privilege\u2014pardon the word, please: it's the correct word\u2014if you're willing to privilege objective truth over your own surging emotions and personal resentments, you know that it's all one Big Lie.  It's a usual thing for people suspected of a crime to be detained by law enforcement. If they have kids, this perforce separates them from their kids, since no humane society wants kids placed in adult detention facilities.  That's been true in the case of U.S. citizens for ever. To say it should not pertain to non-citizens is to privilege\u2014again, that's the mot juste here\u2014to privilege foreigners over our own people. And foreigners have a straightforward way to avoid this particular peril: They can stay in their own countries.  \"But they're desperate!\" wail the hysterics. \"Their countries are so messed up! And it's OUR FAULT they're messed up!\"  The first thing to be said about that is, that a very great many countries are messed up. Billions\u2014that's \"billions\" with a \"b\"\u2014of people live in messed-up countries. A handful of outliers excepted, all countries are messed up except the few established and majority-populated by Ice People\u2014Europeans and East Asians.  Getting and keeping a not-messed-up country seems to be a difficult, an extraordinarily difficult achievement. Not even Ice People can always pull it off. For a non-messed-up country, iciness is necessary but not sufficient. Russia is quite badly messed up; so is China. Check out Albania. Check out North Korea. Being an Ice People country doesn't guarantee you're not messed up, nor vice versa, but that's the way to bet.  As for the notion of it being our fault that Central American countries are messed up, I don't buy it. For one thing, messed-up-ness is the normal state of affairs for countries not populated and run by Ice People, as just stated.  Take Latin America. It's hard not to notice that the general level of messed-upness down there is greatest where Ice People are least numerous. The southern \"cone\" countries\u2014Chile, Argentina, Uruguay\u2014with mostly Ice People populations, have their problems, no doubt; but none of them is Guatemala or El Salvador. They are the least messed-up Latin American countries.  How is that? Did we evil Gringos just forget to go and mess them up? Please.  I'm put in mind of the reply the Mexican made to the Texan when Tex asked why Mexicans are always so mad at the U.S.A. and blame us for everything. The Mexican's reply, according to P.J. O'Rourke: \"You stole half our country. And not only that, Se\u00f1or, you stole the half with all the paved roads.\"  And then, if your country messed up my country, why would I spend my family's savings and risk life and limb to break into your country, the great messer-upper?  One of the blessings of living in Central America is that if you are dissatisfied with your country, there are lots of countries close by you can flee to for refuge. A citizen of Honduras is closer to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Panama, Colombia, and the Bahamas than he is to the U.S.A., and not much further from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil.  Refuge-wise, he's spoiled for choice. Why would he want to come here, to the Great Satan, with all our cruelty and racism and xenophobia and white supremacy and toxic masculinity?  Mrs. Hernandez, the mother in the Time magazine cover story, doesn't seem at all mad about Uncle Sam messing up her country.  Listings of the Four Cardinal Virtues generally put prudence at number one.  In the realm of the National Question\u2014the question of what kind of nation we wish to be, and of what kind of nation we wish our children and grandchildren to inherit\u2014prudence is surely appropriate.  If getting and maintaining a non-messed-up country is as difficult at it seems to be, and as dependent as it seems to be on a healthy supermajority of Ice People, prudence consists in a strict attention to demographic stability and the avoidance of wild demographic experiments.  With all my heart, and with as loud a voice as I can raise, for the sake of my children and their children, I urge prudence upon our nation's leaders.  But what our nation's leaders are actually doing is \u2026 nothing much.  There are plain political reasons for this. Some of them, some of those reasons, have been the motivations behind this week's hysteria over illegal aliens. Others are more longstanding and baked-in to our system.  Our national legislature is quite finely balanced between the two big parties. The Senate is Republican by 51 percent; the House is Republican by 54 percent (55 percent if you factor in currently vacant seats). Under these circumstances, with midterm elections just twenty weeks away, both parties are of course strategizing like crazy.  The Democrats' strategy is to run out the clock: doing nothing either positive or negative while striving to make President Trump look as bad as possible in the eyes of their base\u2014GoodWhite ethnomasochists and racial minorities. The Main Stream Media are totally on board with this, and pushing the strategy for all they're worth.  That's what this week's hysteria has been about. Random comment from a random media shill, this one actually Charles Blow [Email him] at the New York Times June 17th:  Trump is lying, as he often does. This barbaric policy is an outgrowth of his own personal cruelty \u2026 This practice of family separation must end, and Trump and every other politician who was silent about it or worse, endorsed it, must be held to account at the ballot box.[Trump and the Baby Snatchers]  That puts it as plainly as you could want. Trump is an evil person! Vote Democrat!  Godwin's Law\u2014which states, just to remind you, that as an internet discussion thread grows longer, the probability of someone mentioning Hitler approaches certainty\u2014has been much in evidence in this week's hysteria: so much so, in fact, that even some of the Open-Borders people have felt moved to protest.  Here for example was John Podhoretz, an old-school Jewish immigration sentimentalist and race denialist:  Hitler wanted all Jews dead. Trump wants non-Americans who are here in violation of US law out of the United States. Dislike that all you wish. I do. I do not think this is the right policy. But it's not the systematic elimination of the Other. Stop cheapening the Holocaust to score political points, June 22, 2018  Which might be a bit more persuasive if Podhoretz had not himself done a bit of Holocaust-cheapening five months ago when he compared either Presidential advisor Stephen Miller or our own Steve Sailer\u2014it's not clear which\u2014to Joseph Goebbels.  Still, it's a sign of how crazy things have gotten that even Podhoretz, a neocon's neocon, thinks the Godwinization of our public discourse has gone too far.  That's congressional Democrats and their MSM shills. What about congressional Republicans?  Well, there have been signs of sentient life in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Goodlatte Bill was voted down on Thursday, but it got 193 GOP votes, that's 82 percent of the House Republicans who voted\u2014much better than forecast. Praise and blessings from Radio Derb to all 193 of those House Republicans; a pox on the 41 Republican Nays (except those who, like Rep. Steve King, were voting against the Amnesty provision that the bill was trying to trade for patriotic reforms).  Speaker Paul Ryan himself did not vote. This is customary and not at all remarkable.  Ryan does, however, seem to have taken that better-than-expected 193 vote count to heart. He's been working up a bill of his own, a much cuckier, more donor-friendly bill. He'd planned to bring his bill to a vote this week right after Goodlatte's, but that vote has now been postponed to next week so that Ryan can jiggle the bill a bit to make it more acceptable to the 193. [House Rejects Hard-Line Immigration Bill and Delays Vote on Compromise, By Thomas Kaplan and Nicholas Fandos, The New York Times, June 21, 2018]  There is very little prospect that Ryan's jiggling will make this second bill anything other than what it currently seems to be: a huge mass Amnesty for alien scofflaws garnished with some vague, easily-reversed promises on border security and internal enforcement. That's what GOP donors want, and that's what Ryan will give them. After all, six months from now he'll be working for them openly, full-time, as a lobbyist.  The Senate is as usual immigration-shy and effectively inert. Even if Ryan's bill passes the House, it will die in the Senate. Everybody, including Paul Ryan, knows this.  So it's all kabuki theater. Democrats want to go into the midterms saying to their base that the President is Hitler; Republicans want to go in saying to their base that, heck, we know you want something done and we tried to do something, we really did, but there are just too many darn Democrats in Congress to get anything through.  The actual mood of the Republican base seems to be strongly pro-enforcement, even after this MSM blizzard of stories about howling toddlers being ripped from their mothers' arms. The strong vote for the Goodlatte Bill reflects this: GOP congresscritters have been hearing from their constituents.  My own thumbnail gauge of GOP voter sentiment is, as I mentioned last week, the Letters columns of the New York Post, which I have reason to believe actually reflect the feelings of readers of this conventionally center-right newspaper in a not-very-Republican region.  The Post actually ran an editorial about border detentions as the hysteria got under way, taking quite a stern line against President Trump's policy. [Stop breaking up families at the border, June 17, 2018] I waited patiently to see what the Letters column showed.  That editorial ran on Sunday, June 17. Monday, June 18, nothing. Tuesday, June 19, seven letters. Five of the seven were hysterical. The words \"ripping,\" \"ripping,\" \"kidnapping,\" and \"ripped\" showed up in four of the five. Godwin's law of course kicked in, quote from a Manhattan letter-writer: \"I now feel like I'm living in Nazi Germany,\" That's from the heart of New York City, current mayor Comrade Bill \"Honeymoon in Castro's Cuba\" de Blasio.  Even then, though\u2014on Tuesday, as the hysteria was cresting\u2014two of the Post's seven reader letters were non-hysterical. One blamed the illegals for putting their children at risk. Another calmly suggested using FEMA facilities\u2014Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2014to house the detainees.  Friday the Post ran another batch of readers' letters, nine this time. Only one followed the hysterical line. Incredibly, it refrained from invoking Godwin's Law; but it did include the phrase, quote, \"ripped from their mothers' arms,\" The other eight wanted better border control and scoffed at the hysteria. Seven of the eight supported current policy. The eighth opposed it from the right, deploring, \"President Trump's executive order flip-flop,\u201d which the writer blamed on Ivanka and Melania.  I don't say this is definitive, certainly not any kind of scientific survey. Those letters do show, though, that even here in New York\u2014the beating heart of Left-liberal lunacy and Republican cuckery\u2014there are plenty of people not taken in by the hysteria.  I agree, by the way, with that eighth New York Post reader that Trump's Executive Order was a blunder. The policy that caused all the hysteria\u2014separating kids from their parents or pretend-parents and keeping them in HHS facilities for a few days\u2014was perfectly legal, defensible, and humane. What's supposed to happen now? We put the kids in Border Patrol lock-ups? How is that better?  The logic is inescapable. An adult who crosses the border without authorization is liable to arrest and detention, quite rightly so. If there are children with him, those children need to be detained and cared for, too; though since it's the adult who broke the law, not the child, this is a child-care issue, not a law-enforcement issue.  If child-care detention in HHS facilities is unacceptable, and detention of children in Border Patrol lockups with their parents is unthinkable, the only possibility is to let the kids go. So thousands of children\u2014including a lot of teenagers and likely some adults posing as teenagers \u2014with no proper claim to U.S. residence, have gotten it. And when the accompanying adult really is the child's parent, they'll get to stay too.[\u2018Unaccompanied Migrant CHILDREN\u2019 Arrive at NY Airport -Appear to be GROWN MEN With SCRUFFY BEARDS and Shaving Kits (VIDEO), Gateway Pundit, June 23, 2018]  Our courts will make sure of that. Our courts are in fact a big part of the problem. Michelle Malkin many years ago stated the Prime Directive of immigration jurisprudence: \"It ain't over until the alien wins.\" That will probably be the governing factor in the fate of these Central American border-jumpers going forward.  A friend who knows much more about our laws and Constitution than I do tells me that Congress could in fact bar the federal judiciary from considering these cases.  That's nice, supposing my friend is right and I've understood him correctly; but the chance of Congress actually doing anything that imaginative, or that patriotic, is so small you'd need an electron microscope to see it. So this idea is like\u2014to leap to the other end of the cosmic scale\u2014is like the Heat Death of the Universe: kind of interesting, but not actually relevant to anything likely to happen in our lives.  The President could anyway have spared himself all the wrangling his administration's in for with the judiciary, and could also have spared us this last few day's screeching hysteria, by just doing what he was elected to do: build an effective border barrier.  It's not that hard. Israel's done it; Hungary's done it; Saudi Arabia and India have done it. China did it two thousand years ago.  What, you want to tell me we can't do it until Congress appropriates the funds? I don't believe it. I understand about checks and balances, but the President doesn't have that little power. If we can bomb wedding parties in Afghanistan without a Congressional declaration of war, surely we can put up a decent border barrier.  This has been Trump's greatest failure. Those of who voted for him, campaigned for him, and turned out on freezing winter mornings to show our support for him, need to keep telling him this.  Build the damn wall, Mr. President!

Nor did they target some ordinary bank. They struck an account managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, an institution renowned for its security.  In vaults 80 feet below the streets of Manhattan, the bank holds the world\u2019s largest repository of gold. Many of these gold bars belong to foreign governments, which feel safer storing their gold inside well-defended bunkers in America than at home.  Related: North Korea Threatens to Pull Out of Trump Summit: A Closer Look (The Week)  By the same token, overseas governments also store cash with the Fed. But this is cash in the 21st-century sense: all ones and zeroes, not smudgy bills. The bank holds vast foreign wealth on humming servers wired up to the internet.  That\u2019s what the thieves went after in February 2016: nearly $1 billion, sitting in a Fed-run account. This particular account happened to belong to Bangladesh. Having already hacked into the servers of the Bangladesh Central Bank, the criminals waited until a Friday \u2014 a day off in many Muslim-majority nations, Bangladesh included.  Then they started draining the account.  Posing as Bangladesh Central Bank staff, the hackers sent a flurry of phony transfer requests to the Fed totaling nearly $1 billion. The Fed started zapping cash into accounts managed by the thieves overseas, most of them in the Philippines. Much of the money was quickly pulled out as cash or laundered through casinos.  From there, the trail goes cold.  \u00a9 getty  The hackers didn\u2019t get the full billion they desired. Most of the bogus requests were caught and canceled by suspicious personnel. But they did end up with an amazing score: $81 million.  The culprits of this heist are loyal to one of the most impressive organized crime syndicates in the world. They don\u2019t work for the Triads, nor the Sinaloa Cartel, nor Sicily\u2019s Cosa Nostra. They are agents of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (or RGB), which is headquartered in Pyongyang. This is North Korea\u2019s equivalent to the CIA.  Like the CIA, North Korea\u2019s RGB is steeped in clandestine overseas plots: assassinations, abductions and lots of spying. But it is perhaps better understood as a mash-up between the CIA, the KGB and the Yakuza.  What distinguishes the bureau is its entrepreneurial streak \u2014 one with a distinctly criminal bent.  For decades, North Korea has been beleaguered by Western sanctions and barred from global markets. This has prodded the regime to seek revenue in darker realms that are beyond the law. These black-market enterprises have included heroin production, printing bogus $100 bills and counterfeiting name-brand cigarettes.  \u00a9 getty  But all of those rackets have now been totally eclipsed by hacking. The bureau has trained up the world\u2019s greatest bank-robbing crews, a constellation of hacking units that pull massive online heists.  These thieves also have one distinct advantage over other syndicates: They are absolutely confident that they\u2019ll never be charged. So it goes when your own country sponsors your criminal mischief.  This is a new phenomenon, according to US intelligence officials. \u201cA nation state robbing banks \u2026 that\u2019s a big deal. This is different,\u201d says Richard Ledgett. He was, until his recent retirement, the deputy director of the National Security Agency.  In recent years, North Korea has launched hacks against more than 100 banks and online exchanges in a total of 30 countries. The RGB appears to have successfully pilfered $650 million. That we know of.  And yet they are chronically overlooked \u2014 at least in the American media, where talk of online subterfuge is dominated by Russian political hacks. If you weren\u2019t aware that North Korea pulled a heist on the Federal Reserve, note that the caper went down in February 2016, when the media spotlight was fixed on the US presidential race at the expense of, well, almost everything else.  Now that gaze has swung toward North Korea \u2014 and for good reason.  Not so long ago, North Korea spoke of smiting the US with its \u201ctreasured nuclear sword of justice.\u201d Now it offers grand gestures of warmth. Kim Jong-un has released American prisoners. He has giddily stepped into South Korea \u2014 if only for a moment \u2014 and he is now readying peace talks with President Donald Trump, a man who has threatened the young autocrat\u2019s life via Twitter. (This could all change in an instant, of course.  \u00a9 getty South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un shake hands at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, South Korea, April 27, 2018  The North Korean leader suspended talks with South Korea on Wednesday over joint US-Korea military exercises and threatened to cancel his summit with Trump.)  South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un shake hands at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, South Korea, April 27, 2018.  For now, Kim Jong-un and Trump intend to meet in Singapore on June 12. This round and future rounds of talks \u2014 should they proceed without breaking down \u2014 will center on the fact that, against all odds, the leader of this impoverished nation has acquired humankind\u2019s most powerful creation: the hydrogen bomb.  That we all know. But those with deep knowledge of North Korea\u2019s RGB also tend to believe that North Korea has pulled off another stunning technological feat: amassing one of the most skilled hacking syndicates in the world.  Moreover, these bank heists are linked to the state\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Missile tests provoke sanctions. Sanctions dry up North Korea\u2019s foreign cash reserves. Pyongyang is then left scrambling to find alternate revenue streams in the underworld. None of these criminal enterprises are as lucrative as hacking \u2014 and none poses a greater threat to the US-dominated global financial system.  To make sense of North Korea\u2019s hacking feats, I sought out Kim Heung-Kwang, a bespectacled 58-year-old computer scientist living in Seoul. Kim is familiar with the thinking of tech-savvy servants of the regime in Pyongyang.  He used to be one of them.  Kim isn\u2019t all that easy to find. That\u2019s how he likes it.  After agreeing to meet, Kim sends directions by text. Following them leads my co-producer, Sona Jo, and me into a drab cement structure on the outskirts of Seoul, far from the capital\u2019s glitzy shopping promenades. Outside, it\u2019s snowing softly and a chill pervades the unheated building. Reaching Kim\u2019s chambers requires a steep climb up a freezing stairwell.  He answers the doorbell in a chipper mood \u2014 \u201cCome in!\u201d he says, in a sing-song melody \u2014 and promptly offers a cup of green tea. On the way here, I was braced for an awkward, slow-to-warm sort of encounter. That vibe has characterized some of my past interviews with North Korean defectors. They were, after all, reared from birth to despise Americans.  \u00a9 getty  \u201cWell, you\u2019re jackals!\u201d Kim says when I ask about his anti-American indoctrination. He\u2019s laughing with his eyes, which crinkle when he smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s what they say. Americans are our everlasting enemy. Bosses of a corrupt empire.\u201d  But Kim is welcoming, exuding the demeanor of a gentle professor. I can\u2019t say the same of the other man in the room: a tall guy, clad in a dark coat, who does not introduce himself but eyes us up and down before retreating to a corner in silence. I decide not to ask.  Kim Heung-Kwang, a computer networks specialist who now heads an association of highly educated North Korean defectors.  Ultimately, he made it to the far shore unscathed and, from China, made his way to South Korea. Today, he heads an alliance of highly educated North Korean defectors.  He keeps busy by running this alliance \u2014 called North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity \u2014 which comprises escaped North Korean lawyers, doctors, engineers, academics and programmers. The intel he has gathered from these associates suggests to him that North Korea\u2019s hackers are \u201can absolute treasure to Kim Jong-un,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it is becoming clear that North Korean hackers are the best in the world.\u201d  Kim is a computer scientist himself. He specializes in digital networks and claims he took part in early modem communication between Pyongyang and Hamhung, North Korea\u2019s second-largest city and Kim\u2019s hometown.  That\u2019s also where he spent years as a university professor, teaching soldiers-to-be about online networks. Many of his students, he says, were swept into the RGB to fulfill their ultimate mission: infiltrating the networks of enemies overseas.  Kim believes this background, plus his access to intel shared among hundreds of highly placed defectors, qualifies him as an authority on North Korean hackers. They are, he says, profoundly underestimated on the world stage.  \u201cThey\u2019re the geniuses of North Korea,\u201d Kim says. \u201cLet\u2019s make this simple. You want to rank countries when it comes to government hacking? Well, most people will say America is number one, Russia is number two, China is number three and so on.\u201d  \u201cBut tell me, honestly. Is anyone pulling off as many successful hacking operations as North Korea?\u201d  Let\u2019s review some of North Korea\u2019s greatest hacks.  In 2014, North Korean agents crept into the digital infrastructure of Sony Pictures, which was preparing to release \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a screwball comedy about assassinating Kim Jong-un. Pyongyang\u2019s agents wiped data and leaked embarrassing emails until Sony caved and canceled the film\u2019s mainstream release.  In 2017, North Korean hackers seized Microsoft computers worldwide with a worm known as WannaCry. Devices were rendered useless unless the owner paid a ransom in Bitcoin \u2014 the price of unfreezing the computer. More than 200,000 computers in 150 countries were affected.  WannaCry Ransomware Infection Heat Map  And in the last three years alone, North Korean hackers have targeted banks and cryptocurrency exchanges in the following countries: South Korea, Thailand, India, the Philippines, Poland, Peru, Vietnam, Nigeria, Australia, Mexico, Japan and Singapore. In the US, they\u2019ve gone after Wells Fargo, Citibank and, of course, the New York Federal Reserve.  All told, these heists have pulled in an estimated $650 million in just a few years.  \u201cSo even just from reading the news,\u201d Kim says, \u201ceveryone should start to wonder if maybe North Korean hackers are now the very best in the world.\u201d  This sentiment \u2014 laughable just a few years ago \u2014 is now shared in unlikely circles.  The $650 million figure comes from Simon Choi, among the more authoritative sources on North Korean hackers. At 34, he has spent much of his young life chasing their digital trail. He is a consultant to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service \u2014 formerly titled the Korean CIA \u2014 as well as the military\u2019s cyberwarfare division.  \u201cI think we\u2019re only able to uncover about 30 percent of their total hacking,\u201d Choi tells me. \u201cThis is just a portion of their activity.\u201d When I asked Choi to rank North Korea\u2019s hackers, he tells me that \u201ctheir skill has come a long way. They are now No. 1 in the world in terms of hacking.\u201d  This is no fluke, Kim says. Under the reign of Kim Jong-un \u2014 the regime\u2019s first millennial dictator \u2014 the RGB has continually restructured itself to emphasize cybercrime. It now oversees an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 hackers.  The bureau was created in 2009, during the last years of Kim Jong-il\u2019s rule. It was comprised of a variety of units devoted to spycraft, overseas killings, psychological warfare and cyberwarfare \u2014 all of them pulled under one roof. According to Kim, once Kim Jong-un ascended to the throne, and took over the RGB, he lavished even more resources on its elite hacking units.  Two of those units stand out as exemplary.  One is known as Unit 121 \u2014 sometimes called \u201cLazarus\u201d or \u201cHidden Cobra\u201d by outside spy agencies \u2014 which pulled off both the Sony Pictures and the Federal Reserve hacks, Choi says. (The FBI has actually looked into filing charges against North Korea for the Fed heist.)  The other is Unit 110, which, according to Choi, began as a specialty unit targeting rival nations\u2019 military intelligence. It has since devoted more energy, Choi says, to bilking credit card systems, ATM networks and, more recently, online stores of cryptocurrency.  Such online finesse begs the question: How is this impoverished state launching so many successful attacks from its home soil \u2014 especially given its constant power outages and primitive digital infrastructure?  It isn\u2019t, Kim says. The bureau simply deploys hacker cells to live abroad \u2014 many of them in China \u2014 where online speeds are much faster. There, North Korean agents may feign jobs as traders or importers but run operations at night.  Other digital clues left by North Korean hackers suggest they\u2019re located in India, Malaysia, Nepal, Indonesia and as far away as Mozambique. Recorded Future, a firm monitoring cyberthreats worldwide, claims North Korean agents look at Amazon, Baidu (China\u2019s Google equivalent), a fair amount of porn and, more embarrassing still, their own AOL accounts. They also use iPads and iPhones. (Kim Jong-un himself has been spotted using Apple computers.)  What can\u2019t be easily discerned from the hackers\u2019 digital breadcrumbs is their ideology. But Kim says that \u201cwhen they attack a bank, it\u2019s not personal. They know it\u2019s illegal under international law but their first motivation is pleasing their Dear Leader. Don\u2019t imagine them feeling guilty or breaking some moral code. They don\u2019t have the same moral code as you.\u201d  \u201cThey just think, well, I have skills that can benefit my country and please the leader,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a golden opportunity to prove their loyalty.\u201d  Kim tells me, look, if you really want to understand the mentality of cadres inside North Korea\u2019s reconnaissance bureau, you should speak to Mr. Jang, his colleague.  And that is how I ended up, days later, in a hipster-ish co-working cafe on the other side of town \u2014 sitting across from a nervous 49-year-old man in a blue jacket.  Jang Seyul is slow to speak, economical in his movements and seemingly allergic to loosening up. He won\u2019t remove his coat. He flinches at the sight of my microphone. I sense that he\u2019s only agreed to meet because Kim put in a request on our behalf.  The son of an army captain, Jang grew up comfortable, at least by North Korean standards. \u201cWe ate meat at least once a month. Mostly fish. And always on the birthdays of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. The military provided my household with rice and, to supplement that, my father raised pigs and dogs for food.\u201d  As a young man, Jang was accepted into Mirim University. He says the institution is known within the military by a quasi-secret title: The Korean People\u2019s Command Automation University. Wired Magazine calls it \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s School for Hackers.\u201d  But Jang was not fated to become a hacker. He was instead taught software related to military strategy \u2014 \u201cwar games,\u201d he says \u2014 and recruited to run battle simulation programs at the RGB.  Climbing this professional ladder was a gauntlet, each step bringing ferocious competition from other young men. For tech-related positions, either academic of professional, he says that \u201c100 openings will attract thousands of applicants.\u201d  He worked alongside hackers both in college and at the bureau. Those with brains would always rise fast, he says. \u201cIn North Korea, there are now very strong incentives to become engineers or IT specialists. Because if you become a cyberexpert, you can become a senior manager within the Communist Party,\u201d he says. \u201cBoys and men dream of pursuing this path.\u201d  Hacking has a special cachet in North Korea, Jang says, because it affords a life grander than a rice farmer could ever imagine. The most skilled programmers are allowed to move their entire families from hardscrabble provinces into the capital of Pyongyang, a privilege denied to common servants of the state.  In the capital, he says, the hackers\u2019 families can enjoy great luxuries: hot water around the clock, regular electricity, rare food items \u2014 such as bananas \u2014 that are beyond the basic soldier\u2019s ration allotment. (Other North Korean defectors have corroborated that eating bananas \u2014 or any imported tropical fruit \u2014 indicates high status.)  But the very best cyberwarriors are deployed abroad and, by necessity, given free access to the internet. Of course, the web is a space seething with information the Kim dynasty hides from the general population. \u201cSo these people do learn about North Korea\u2019s reputation as a dictatorship,\u201d Jang says. \u201cThey know what they do is considered criminal.\u201d  \u201cBut still, they may feel proud,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re earning money for their country by targeting the enemy.\u201d  But all evidence indicates they\u2019re not just targeting their traditional \u201cenemy\u201d: those wicked Americans and, as Pyongyang\u2019s apparatchiks see it, their quasi-colony in South Korea. They\u2019re hitting banks all across the world, especially poorly defended institutions in Southeast Asia.  So, how to justify robbing Bangladesh, one of the poorer countries in Asia, with a literacy rate worse than that of North Korea?  Reuters on Bangladesh Heist  Jang breaks down the mental gymnastics: \u201cIn North Korea, we learn that America doesn\u2019t just militarily invade countries around the world. It also manipulates the world using its dollar regime \u2014 the global financial system.\u201d  In other words: Any one institution participating in the global banking network is fair game. The fact that US-imposed sanctions prevent North Korea from accessing these very networks only sweetens the justification, Jang says. \u201cThrough hacking, they feel they\u2019re lifting those sanctions,\u201d he says, and thus making up lost revenue.  For North Korean hackers, the alternative to maintaining this worldview \u2014 drifting into some fantasy of revolt \u2014 is almost unthinkable, he says. They have too much to lose: an unfiltered view of the web, relief from hunger and want, parents and siblings living cozily in Pyongyang.  \u201cThese apartments for the wealthy [in Pyongyang], they are under strict observation,\u201d Jang says. \u201cSo the hacker\u2019s family are like hostages in a sense.\u201d If the hacker turns dissident, he says, \u201cthen the worst can happen.\u201d  The worst?  \u201cYes,\u201d Jang says. \u201cBecause they are soldiers, I think their families could be killed. All of them.\u201d  There is an expression in North Korea, he tells me: \u201cIt is easy to wake up a person who is sleeping, but it\u2019s very hard to wake up the man who is pretending to sleep.\u201d  Watch CNN, or soak up statements from US and South Korean officials, and you will hear over and over that cash hacked by North Korea is funneled into its nuclear weapons program.  But this is an oversimplification, says Andrei Lankov, a scholar at Kookmin University in Seoul and an expert on the North Korean economy.  The professor\u2019s authority on the subject is boosted by an unusual resume. Lankov was born in the now-defunct USSR and, in the mid-1980s, he was sent to study at North Korea\u2019s answer to Harvard: Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang. He still speaks Korean in the northern dialect and keeps close tabs on the regime.  As for the hacked money? He believes it\u2019s used to buy goods and services including:  \u201cChanel bags for the mistresses of top leaders.\u201d \u201cAntibiotics for sick children.\u201d \u201cLow-quality but calorie-rich rice to feed the malnourished population, including residents of homes for senior citizens.\u201d \u201cSpare parts for a new transcontinental missile capable of hitting New York.\u201d  In other words, Lankov says, the cash will help satisfy all of the state\u2019s needs, large and small, benevolent and crooked. And cadres in Pyongyang don\u2019t fret over the fact that it\u2019s stolen.  \u201cThey see themselves as victims,\u201d Lankov says, \u201cand they see international law as completely meaningless, full of hypocrisy, used by the great powers to perpetrate their privileged positions.\u201d  This is the worldview that goaded the state to export heroin in the 1970s \u2014 its first big plunge into mafia-style criminality \u2014 and later churn out counterfeit cigarettes and fake US cash.  \u201cFor a long time, they pinned their hope on narcotics. Then they discovered the money is not all that good. Yet the damage to their reputation is terrible. So they quit,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now, with hacking, they have found their next great hope \u2026 and I would not be surprised if hacking now plays a major role in their revenue structure.\u201d  When it comes to North Korea\u2019s total income, hacking still can\u2019t match selling coal to China or even sending laborers overseas, where North Koreans are dispatched to saw down trees in Siberia or weld steel in the Middle East. At the moment, however, both of those revenue streams are strangled by UN-imposed sanctions.  This only elevates the demand for hackers further still. And there is no shortage of students willing to learn the trade.  \u201cIf your only capital is the brain matter in your hat,\u201d Lankov says, \u201cbecoming a government hacker is probably the best career \u2014 especially for a brainy boy from the countryside.\u201d  A kid who might end up plucking radishes in decades past may, with the right training, join a crew that generates a few million dollars with a single big online heist. That influx of cash wouldn\u2019t move the needle for a superpower such as China or America. But in North Korea \u2014 where the $28 billion national economy is on par with that of Gary, Indiana \u2014 it can secure great status and adulation.  Lankov says the ruling party does worry that its hackers will absorb anti-regime information online. \u201cBut they\u2019re bringing in so much money,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the state is going to overlook this problem.\u201d  \u201cLook, [the typical hacker] is probably not going to run away,\u201d Lankov says. \u201cThe system is designed in such a way that escape is almost impossible. And he\u2019s not going to start an opposition movement. Because that is very painful way of suicide.\u201d  This talk of Pyongyang\u2019s stranglehold on its cyberexperts brings me back to Kim, the computer specialist, sitting in his chilly office in Seoul \u2014 the one where that shifty-eyed man watches over him as he works.  Since his escape, Kim says he\u2019s received menacing phone calls. Emails. Faxes even. All indicating that, if he doesn\u2019t shut up, he\u2019s going to be murdered.  \u201cI\u2019m on their blacklist,\u201d he says, removing his glasses to rub his temples. \u201cThere\u2019s a standing order to have me killed. You may have noticed the man who\u2019s always with me?\u201d  He nods at that stone-faced man in the dark coat, sitting in a chair by the front door.  \u201cHe\u2019s a South Korean agent,\u201d Kim explains. \u201cHe\u2019s actually here to protect me.\u201d  For North Korean defectors, these are strange and dizzying times. Though much of the world mocks or shrugs off North Korea\u2019s threats to its rivals, Kim takes every menacing statement from Pyongyang very seriously.  People watch a TV showing a live broadcast of the inter-Korean summit as South Korean President Moon Jae-in shakes hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at a railway station in Seoul, South Korea, April 27, 2018.  But there is now a sense that North Korea\u2019s relationship to the world is in wild flux. The rogue state was only recently fantasizing about bombing Washington, DC, into \u201cashes and darkness\u201d \u2014 and yet it now speaks vaguely of \u201cdenuclearization.\u201d  But it is unclear whether this peace-and-unity vibe will extend into the digital battlefield. Should we expect North Korea to suddenly rein in its hackers \u2014 the RGB units that have harnessed its best and brightest minds to help keep the regime afloat?  You might imagine that Kim the North Korean cyberexpert-turned-academic \u2014 who spends his days and nights pondering over the regime\u2019s next move \u2014 would have arrived at a tidy answer. But he sounds just as uncertain as anyone else. His instincts tell him to wait for that much-hyped potential meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un before analyzing the situation further.  Perhaps North Korea will bring its hackers to heel in hopes of securing a sweeter prize: the end of crushing sanctions. Maybe Kim Jong-un will walk away from from the table, as he is threatening. But if this summit ends in disaster, he says, Pyongyang will feel emboldened to unleash its online bank robbers for even more brazen heists.  \u201cMaybe [Trump and Kim Jong-un] will have a romance. Or maybe it\u2019ll be an action movie,\u201d Kim says. \u201cLet\u2019s just say this: If the two ever meet, it will bring together the two weirdest men in the world.\u201d  Related: Things you may not know about North Korea",

                              "text": "in Communal Harmony \u2014 by Anandi Sharan \u2014 November 5, 2016 \nOn Monday the 31st of October 2016 the Madhya Pradesh police assassinated eight alleged associates of the Students\u2019 Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) after an alleged escape from prison near Bhopal. This was not coincidentally a day when the Prime Minister Narendra Modi was hyping Hindu nationalism on Diwali, the Hindu festival that celebrates the return of the mythic god Ram to Ayodhya in present day Uttar Pradesh. The assassination was most certainly a celebration of Diwali and Hindu nationalism by assassination of Muslims. Narendra Modi on the previous day had sent sms to all Indian citizens asking them to send sweets to soldiers on Diwali. He had tweeted: \u201cfestivals are fixed not only by the mood of the moon but by the mood of the people.\u201d It was a message to policemen members of the Sangh Parivar to seize the moment and perform a Hindu nationalist strike against Muslims in the name of anti-Muslim terrorist national pride. \nNarendra Modi came to power in 2014 on the basis of a twenty-year-old Hindutva fascist take over of the country by the Hindu political establishment including the Supreme Court. \nFor 18 years in the lead up to the 2014 Parliamentary elections 19 Chief Justices failed to reverse an illegal judgement pronounced by J.S. Verma in the case of R.Y. Prabhoo vs P.K. Kunte on 11 December 1995, a judgement issued at the end of P.V. Narsimha Rao\u2019s Prime Ministership. \nIn that judgement, known as the Hindutva Judgement, Verma claimed that Hinduism/Hindutva is not a religion but a way of life, failing to see that just because Hinduism does not have a book like most of the other religions does not mean it is not a religion. \nA.M.Ahmadi was CJI at the time of the Hindutva Judgement, having been appointed on 25 October 1994. The demand for an expeditious and authoritative decision on the question of whether appealing to Hinduism is an appeal to religion was made by K. Ramaswamy, on 16 April 1996. In the case of Abhiram Singh vs C.D. Commachen & Ors the judge stated: \n<<as to when the case (of corrupt practice under section 123 (3) and (3A) of Representation of People Act 1951) is held proved has not been specifically laid as law. This requires to be authoritatively decided. As stated earlier when and under what circumstances speeches of the leaders of the political party or the appeal of any other person with the consent by a candidate or his election agent to vote or refrain from voting on the ground of religion, race, caste or community or language, etc. or promotion or an attempt to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India on the ground of religion, race, caste, community or language with the consent of the candidate or his election agent for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of the candidate or prejudicially affect the election of any candidates constitutes corrupt practice under sub-sections [3] or [3A] of Section 123. Its content and scope also require to be clearly laid down authoritatively lest miscarriage of justice in interpretation of \u201ccorrupt practice\u201d involved in every election petition would ensue. The purity of election process gets fouled and be fraught with deleterious effect in a democratic polity. Thus, without expressing any opinion on these questions, we are of the view that the entire case requires to be heard and decided by a large Bench of five Judges since the decision thereon upon the purity of election process and requires to be decided authoritatively. We, therefore, direct the Registry to place the case before our learned brother, the Chief Justice for constituting a larger Bench of five Judges, and, if possible, at an early date so that all the questions arising in the present appeal could be decided authoritatively and expeditiously. >> \nThe demand was made on 16 April 1996. If Ahmadi had acted immediately he could have prevented Atal Behari Vajpayee becoming Prime Minister for the first time a month later on 16th May 1996. Vajpayee was a Sangh Parivar pracharak who said he may or may not be PM but he will always be an RSS swayamsevak for as long as he lives. He said there is no difference between BJP and RSS, and that he had had the privilege of undergoing training under RSS founder Dr. Hedgewar and former chief Gowalkar. Hindutva is a fascist ideology taken over by Hedgewar and Gowalkar from Savarkar who adapted it from Europe to justify extermination of Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Dalits and Adivasis for the greater glory of the sacred Hindu nation in the world. \nThe cross-party Hindu Indian elite presented Vajpayee as a respectable moderate elder statesman, a worthy successor to P.V.Narsimha Rao. No one questioned that his political power is fascism. A report by the RSS in the aftermath of the riots in Delhi in 1984 in which Sikhs were murdered as a community for Indira Gandhi\u2019s assassination revealed the true attitude of the RSS to Sikhs. They were to stay silent and wait for the righteous anger of the murderers to abate. The RSS are not alone in their justification of communalism. Rajiv Gandhi who became Prime Minister after the riots in part due to the sympathy vote for the assassination of his mother said at the time that if a big tree falls the forest is bound to shake. The Congress Hindu elite in India has always used communalism as a political tool, and has no compunction in allowing the RSS to do the same. The organisers of the anti-Sikh pogroms have still not been arrested though the official report has found irrefutable evidence against all of them. \nThe failure of law and order in BJP states such as demonstrated on 31st October 2016 and the failure of the central government law and order enforcement machinery including the Supreme Court is due to the hijacking of the institutions and organs of justice including the constitution by the Hindu political elites. It may seem shocking to some to hear the SC so accused. But the failure of law and order enforcement is only the visible tip of the iceberg of a complete break down of secular democracy in India since Nehru\u2019s days, a break down that is in fact nothing other than the take over of the country by fascists under the aegis of the Congress party. Once the government looses its commitment to equality, justice, secularism, socialism, fraternity and rule of law, as mandated by the constitution, and instead starts to rewrite the constitution, the stage is set for fascism. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru started the rot when he imprisoned Sheikh Abdullah of Jammu and Kashmir in the 1960s and illegally dissolved the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly contrary to Article 370 of the constitution. Nehru\u2019s betrayal of Kashmiris was the beginning of fascism in India. It was a short step to overthrowing the Representation of the People Act that forbids appeal to religion to garner votes. \nAhmadi\u2019s tenure as CJI was to come to an end on 24 March 1997. By convicting BJP politicians for promoting enmity between classes on the basis of religion under the RP Act Ahmadi could have forced politicians to abide by the law and adopt secular democratic politics. Such a judgement would have helped enforce the law in all aspects of public life, which was a big concern at the time. The time should have been right for the overthrow of fascism in India. \nOn the 19th of July 1996 there had been the strange case of Dr.D.C. Saxena vs Hon\u2019Ble The Chief Justice Of India in which CJI Ahmadi and Prime Minister P.V. Narsimha Rao were accused of corruption for misusing public accommodation and transport for private purposes. It is very strange how instead of the major issue of subversion of secular democracy in the Hindutva Judgement, the CJI chose to take up this strange case at the highest level. Why take up such a marginal issue of misuse of public accommodation and transport, and hold the petitioner guilty of contempt of court and so on? One cannot help feel that this was just a gigantic manoeuvre to pull the wool over the eyes of the public to hide other much more major failings of both the CJI and the PM, namely failure to implement the Verma Committee Report on corruption in the government, and failure to give an authoritative and expeditious decision on Hindutva, which were part and parcel of the same fascism that he could not get himself to challenge. \nThe N.N.Verma Committee report had exposed the failure of the state machinery to deal with law and order and political mafia nexus. If Ahmadi and P.V. Narsimha Rao had no interest in outlawing the Ram Temple Party it must have been because they found themselves incapable of dealing with the infiltration of the mafia including the Sangh Parivar mafia into all aspects of public life with which they were in collusion. In that sense they were part of the mafia, especially P.V. Narasimha Rao of course, whose son is a well-known crorepati with business interests in road construction all over the country. On his retirement Ahmadi had a princely sum of Rs 5000 a month to live on. He did want to return to Ahmedabad, his hometown, but stayed in Delhi. He probably needed to make and keep friends in high places in private and public business to live a more comfortable lifestyle. \nOn the 9th of July 1993 the government of P.V. Narsimha Rao could no longer escape the pressure to deal with corruption and he established the N.N. Vora Committee. Its mandate was to take stock of all available information about the activities of Crime Syndicates/Mafia organisations that had developed links with and were being protected by Government functionaries and political personalities. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, the central government was supposed to determine the need, if any to establish a special organisation/agency to regularly collect information and pursue cases against such elements. The report brought out, in N.N. Vora\u2019s words, \u201cthat the activities of Memon Brothers and Dawood Ibrahim had progressed over the years, leading to the establishment of a powerful network. This could not have happened without these elements having been protected by the functionaries of the concerned Government departments specially Customs, Income Tax, Police and others. \u2026 The CBI (said ..there was a) .. nexus between the Bombay City Police and the Bombay under-world.. over time, the money power thus acquired is used for building up contacts with bureaucrats and politicians and expansion of activities with impunity. The money power is used to develop a network of muscle-power, which is also used by politicians during elections. CBI has reported that all over India crime Syndicates have become a law unto themselves. Even in the smaller towns and rural areas, muscle men have become the order of the day. Hired assassins have become a part of these organisations. The nexus between the criminal gangs, police, bureaucracy and politicians has come out clearly in various parts of the country. The existing criminal justice system, which was essentially designed to deal with the individual offences/crimes, is unable to deal with the activities of the mafia; the provisions of law in regards to economic offences are weak; there are insurmountable legal difficulties in attaching/confiscation of the property acquired through Mafia activities. \u2026. In cases where a crime Syndicate has graduated to big business, it would be necessary to conduct detailed investigations into its assets, both movable and immovable. It has been stressed that when such action is not timely and effectively taken, the lower functionaries of the concerned State and Central Departments /organisations start overlooking the activities of the crime Syndicates. \u2026 The Director Intelligence Bureau (said)\u2026. due to the progressive decline in the values of public life in the country warning signals of sinister linkage between the underworld politicians and the bureaucracy have been evident with disturbing regularity. \u2026\u2026. the network of the Mafia is virtually running a parallel Government, pushing the State apparatus into irrelevance. \u2026..During discussions with Secretary (Revenue) and his principal officers, the following significant observations were made: \u2026the field officers of his various Departments were faced with various problems, amongst which are the utter inadequacy of the criminal system; cases are not heard timely; functioning of the Government lawyers is grossly inadequate; all this results in a low percentage of convictions and mild punishments\u2026. The field officers of the various agencies of the Revenue Departments are often pressurised by senior government functionaries/political leaders apparently at the behest of crime Syndicates/Mafia elements. Unless the field level officers are offered effective protection, they cannot be expected to maintain interest in vigorously pursuing action against the activities of such elements.\u2026The linkages developed by crime syndicated get generally confirmed when pressure is mounted on the concerned agencies not to take action against the offenders or to go slow in the cases against them. Such pressures are mounted either immediately after a raid is conducted or at the time when prosecution is about to be initiated. Pressures are also exerted whenever corrupt and undesirable officers are shifted from sensitive assignments. >> \nThe appeal from the three-judge bench to review the Hindutva Judgement was urgent. The case had arisen along with others precisely because of the illegal politics of the Shiv Sena who were the lords of the Bombay underworld. Ahmadi had only a total of 881 days as CJI, a length of term he knew much in advance of ever being appointed due to the well-known system of CJI appointment by seniority. But instead of planning carefully before becoming CJI, and acting immediately on becoming CJI, Ahmadi declined to act authoritatively and expeditiously and let the Shiv Sena remain in control of Bombay and Maharashtra, and he let Vajpayee and the BJP in as ruling party at the centre for the first time. The BJP was the mafia in Ahmadi\u2019s own home state of Gujarat. But for some peculiar reason he did not perceive the BJP as a Hindutva fascist gang that can be controlled by the RP Act. The RP Act was not considered the law par excellence to introduce probity into public life. This is baffling in the extreme. \nIn an interview given to the journalist Kuldip Nayar two days before he retired published in Outlook India on 09 April 1997 Nayar reported that \n<<Ahmadi evaded comment on the judgement to define Hindutva. He has reservations but is reluctant to spell them out. Asked why he did not refer it to the larger bench, he says that there has to be a system and that the chief justice cannot do so on his own. I reminded him of the letter I had written, requesting him to constitute a larger bench to consider the judgement which I thought affected the basic structure of the Constitution and secularism. He says he did not act \u201cfor obvious reasons\u201d, but adds that in \u201ca recent judgement, the demand for a larger bench has been made\u201d.>> \nThe demand sent eleven months and three weeks before could hardly be termed as \u201crecent.\u201d After his retirement Ahmadi said: \u201c\u201dWe have let down the constitution, the constitution hasn\u2019t let us down. We have not used our constitutional rights to our advantage. We have not seriously tried to avail our legal entitlements,\u201d The report stated:<< Former Indian chief justice A.M. Ahmadi yesterday said Muslims have let down the constitution by not availing of rights enshrined therein. Ahmadi, in his no-nonsense address at the city\u2019s India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC), urged the gathering of around 50 Muslims drawn from different walks of life to use constitutional rights to their advantage.>> \nThe only explanation is that the BJP had something over Ahmadi, some personal corruption that made him behoven to them. Or maybe he made secularism subservient to the politics of ejecting the Congress party. Or maybe he thought the judiciary was helpless. Afterwards he blamed himself as a Muslim for not taking action. But at the time he probably considered himself less a Muslim and more a part of a legal system that was unwilling to take a stance to hold politicians accountable under the law. That was a personal moral risk he as a CJI was not willing to take. Enforcement of RP Act is not a matter of constitutional rights but of law. Ahmadi was not willing to enforce the law. \n18 Chief Justices after him also avoided addressing the demand that Ramaswamy bench had made for a larger bench of the Supreme Court to solve the conflicting judgements on whether or not Hinduism is a religion. \nThe BJP should more aptly be called the Ram Temple party to highlight the fact that the very existence of that party represents fascism par excellence in our country as it is illegal to appeal to religion under the Representation of People Act. \nIn retrospect it is apparent that the BJP came to power in 1996 because the Congress party was discredited due to its corrupt practices as brought out in the N.N. Vora Committee report in 1993. During their tenures as Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi from October 1984 to December 1989 and P.V. Narsimha Rao from June 1991 to May 1996 had given up any semblance of defence of the tenets of equality, justice, secularism, socialism and fraternity as envisaged by the secular democratic constitution. The BJP won only two seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984. But appealing to Hinduism it won eighty-five seats in 1989 and became the third largest party. Prime Minister V. P. Singh had accepted the Mandal Commission report and reserved 27% of government jobs for Other Backward Classes. Anti-reservation slogans were raised by the BJP along with anti-corruption. Rajiv Gandhi appeased Mullahs by reversing the Shah Bano case. Shah Bano had filed a case in the Supreme Court for maintenance from her ex-husband. Under criminal law she was given right. Three years later in 1986 Parliament under Rajiv Gandhi reversed the decision. Arif Mohammed Khan who was in support of the SC judgement, resigned. The BJP\u2019s appeal to so-called majority sentiment was one thing. On the other side the courts banned Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses which in the eyes of Hindu nationalists was appeasement of minorities. No one raised the point that this is the law under the Indian Penal Code. On the other hand Rajiv Gandhi also called Babri Masjid land as \u201cRam\u2019s land\u201d to try and get back the Hindu vote. In reality assassination of Muslims, Dalits, Adivasis and all dark-skinned Indians is the means the Indian state of all parties to date use to consolidate the nation. This is the Hindu Brahmin supremacism. In 1983 the Nellie massacre of 1983 had seen 5,000 people, mainly Muslims, killed; the 1987 Hashimpura massacre saw 40 Muslims killed in cold blood; in the Bhagalpur riots of 1989 the victims were predominantly Muslim; in the Hyderabad riots of 1990 both Hindus and Muslims died; in the Surat riots of 1992 mainly Muslims died. These were all party politically orchestrated events. The Congress party was finished as a secular democratic force. In the Muzaffarnagar event in 2013 forty-six Muslims and sixteen Hindus died, instigated by the socialist Samajwadi Party. In March 2015, sixteen accused policemen were acquitted of their involvement in the Hashimpura massacre. In that violence men from UP police drove Muslim poor daily wage labourers and weavers to a canal and threw them in. Both Samajwadi Party and BJP leaders are instigators of riots. \nAfter Nehru\u2019s betrayal of Kashmir and Sheikh Abdullah, Indira Gandhi had engaged in her own list of illegalities culminating in the Declaration of Emergency to protect her political career. Once Rajiv Gandhi and P.V.Narsimha Rao came to the fore there was no semblance of socialism or commitment to equality left. The only appeal was to liberalism. Once that was equated with corruption the Congress had no vision with which to counter the charge. None of the parties took up the chellenge set to them by the N.N.Verma Committee Report. The BJP claimed it would root out corruption and do liberalisation better but in fact corruption in India is basic to the Hindu supremacist agenda. Liberalism is a means to perpetuate it. \nThe next CJI after Ahmadi was J.S.Verma. He clearly would not choose to overturn his own judgement, and he didn\u2019t. In the period after Babri Masjid Verma and Narsimha Rao did nothing to get Babri Masjid rebuilt. Thus his illegal act that overthrew the constitution, stood because he and the Prime Minister and the political establishment wanted it to stand. Verma retired on 17 January 1998 and was replaced by CJI M.M.Punchhi who had 264 days as CJI and retired on 09 October 1998. There had been a petition of the Committee on Judicial Accountability (CJA), which demanded a probe against Punchhi on corruption charges and Ram Jetmalani and others wanted to get him impeached in the Rajya Sabha, and Verma could have recommended supersession. Jetmalani is an advocate for the BJP and a Hindutva fanatic. By attacking Punchhi for corruption he ensured that the Hindutva fascists had him in their power. If elevated to CJI he was to behave. And he did. He did not constitute the bench to overthrow the Hindutva Judgement. It is highly likely that the deal was negotiated by Verma. Punchhi would get the CJI post if he did not raise the Hindutva issue. It is quite likely Verma delayed announcing the appointment for two months because it took him that time to persuade Prime Minister IK Gujral to agree. The BJP by now was the main opposition party as the United Front was floundering. There was no secular alliance between Congress and the United Front parties that would have backed a secular CJI. How could there have been. They all use assassination of Muslims to further their party politics. The stage was set for the RSS man V.B. Vajpayee to become the next Prime Minister for a full term. \nPunchhi was replaced by Adarsh Sein Anand as CJI. Anand was CJI from the 10th of October 1998 to the 11th of January 2001. With his predecessors not having rocked the boat of the BJP, what was Anand going to do now that a BJP Prime Minister with an absolute majority was installed in Parliament? A reversal of the Hindutva Judgement would have meant dissolving Parliament and calling fresh elections at a time when the country was just coming out of that period of apparent instability of the United Front government. Deve Gowda had been a Kannadiga farmer who refused to speak Hindi or English in Parliament. Vajpayee was a civilised Hindu. Anand himself was a Kashmiri Hindu. He was a human rights activist. He introduced compensation in cases of custodial death. But then in 2000 Ram Jethmalani the Hindutva activist Supreme Court advocate accused Anand\u2019s wife and mother in law of corruption. Though no charges were brought it was enough to keep Anand toeing the Hindutva government line. He buried the Hindutva Judgement review demand. \nSam Piroj Bharucha was the next CJI, from the 11th of January 2001 to the 6th of May 2002. He had been on the bench with K. Ramaswamy when they found the Hindutva Judgement to be in conflict with other SC judgements on the RP Act and when they had demanded the authoritative and expeditious decision from a five-judge bench that Ahmadi was supposed to set up. Then why did he not take it up when he became CJI, familiar as he was with the entire case? A.B. Vajpayee, BJP, was in power, yes, but an upright CJI would surely not put the political wellbeing of the BJP above the RP Act? The inexplicable thing is that Bharucha did just that. He set up a continuous SC constitutional court of eleven judges under Justice Kirpal to hear 200 petitions to interpret the meaning and content of the word \u2018minorities\u2019 in Article 30(1) of the constitution. It was only the 2nd time in 30 years than an eleven-judge constitution bench was set up. The one set up under Punchhi was disbanded before it could complete the task. But the bench did not take up the inquiry into the scope of review to be conducted when a charge of corrupt practice is levelled under section 123 (3) and (3A) of the RP Act of promoting enmity between classes by appealing to religion to garner votes. He took up hundreds of cases that had been pending for 20 years, why not the Hindutva Judgement? He made a statement at a meeting of the Bar Council of India and the Bar Council of Kerala on the 22nd of December 2001 whilst CJI that 20% of judges are corrupt and that the problem is that in the Supreme Court the only remedy is impeachment. He said: \u201cimpeachment is a cumbersome process and as a recent instance showed may not achieve the desired result for reasons that are political.\u201d On February 9th 2002 he said, that in his experience as a senior judge none in the Bar fought corruption. But even as CJIs are expressing anguish at financial and political corruption in the judiciary, the absolutely fundamental corruption that allows a CJI to be pressurised actively or passively by the BJP to avoid enquiring into the BJP manifesto is not questioned. It can hardly be an argument that it is in the national interest not to call fresh elections in which the BJP might not be able to participate. Was Bharucha of the view that it is politically expedient to let the BJP continue in power? Was he basically by this time of the view that Hinduism is not a religion? And so fascism continued to reign supreme, with the entire political discourse about the role of the judiciary hijacked as anti-corruption, and an eleven-judge constitution bench going no further than working to define \u201cminority\u201d. \nBhupinder Nath Kirpal succeeded Bharucha on the 6th of May 2002 and was CJI for 186 days till the 8th of November 2002. In March 2002 he had told the RSS PM that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad was not allowed to hold a religious ceremony on the land of the Babri Masjid where the BJP wanted to erect a ram Temple. \u201cIt is because of judges like these that our Supreme Court is known as a secular temple all over the world\u201d Rajya Sabha MP Wasim Ahmed said, forgetting that Kirpal also sweetly ignored the pending request to overrule the illegal Hindutva Judgement and consign the BJP to the dustbin of history. Why did Ahmed have to use the word temple? At that time Kirpal had 24\u2019000 cases pending before him in the SC. Still he could have chosen to address the Hindutva case and truly live up to Ahmed\u2019s overhasty praise. Kirpal\u2019s view on corruption in the Judiciary was that \u201cjudges are also Indian citizens who come from the same aggregate as those in the legislature and administration therefore that there are also instances where corruption and incompetence have pervaded the judicial establishment cannot be denied.\u201c The comment says a lot. Government of India is one great big fat Hindu supremacist elite affair where no one rocks the boat. Progressive ideas are strictly within the confines of what Hindu money and the Hindu elite can tolerate. The political parties in the state legislatures and the members of state administrations must throw secular democracy over board and run with the fascist hounds or they will not survive in public life. \nGopal Ballav Patnaik was the next CJI. Later it was found he had been given a 4000 square foot plot in Cuttack meant for underprivileged in the year 2000. He was CJI for a month. During his month as CJI he never once as far as I know raised any issue to do with Hindutva. \nPatnaik was succeeded by V. N. Khare on the 19th of December 2002. V.N. Khare was made the BJP governments arbitrator in a case brought by Reliance on the 23rd of November 2011 when RIL had challenged a government notice to disallow cost and moved the Supreme Court for appointment of a second arbitrator. Ex CJIs Bharucha and Khare failed to agree on the name of the third presiding arbitrator for 13 months and in 2015 Bharucha recused himself from the arbitration after the government challenged his nomination saying that he had not disclosed all previous associations with RIL and that his arbitration could create doubts about his independence and impartiality. So now the arbitration panel has only foreigners on it and Khare is on the BJP government side. Khare had been CJI when Modi as Chief Minister of Gujarat encouraged Hindu mobs to attack Muslims who had protested against Hindus for travelling to and forth to Ayodhya to establish a ram temple. The attack happened ostensibly because Muslims had set on fire the bogeys carrying those RSS cadres. In tapes afterwards it was revealed that Hindus had set the train bogeys on fire, boasting it was Hanuman\u2019s tail that lit the flame. Thereafter 800 people mainly Muslims died across the state in revenge killings encouraged by the government. Sexual violence played a critical role in the pogrom. In the aftermath of the riots in the Best bakery case CJI Khare said \u201cI have no faith left in the prosecution and the Gujarat government\u201d and he moved the case out of Gujarat. After his retirement as CJI Khare said that the Gujarat government did not provide adequate protection to the riot victims owing to the complete collusion between rioters and the state machinery. Modi replied sarcastically that why did he not say anything when he was CJI. Modi clearly was referring not to the Best bakery case but to the fact that Khare did not address the Hindutva Judgement or take up any other election petitions that would have challenged Modi\u2019s appeals to religion during elections. Jairus Banaji in his paper wrote \u201cThe spinelessness of the judiciary and its overt or covert sympathies with the extreme right was a major part of the story of the success of German fascism. We have not reached that state of judicial disintegration yet, and luckily we still have a Supreme Court that is beyond the direct reach of regimes immersed in criminality, even if its Special Investigation team can be subverted.\u201d But actually the SC was already subverted by Verma\u2019s Hindutva Judgement and not even Khare did anything about it not even taking up the pending case. Khare retired as CJI on the 2nd of May 2004. It is really strange that no academic commentaries seem to mention this pending appeal on the Hindutva Judgement and the unwillingness of CJIs to take it up and the fact that this shows how fascism had taken hold of the country latest by May 1996 when Vajpayee was elected for his first short term as Prime Minister. Praful Bidwai wrote in 2007 that the secular parties collectively failed the victims of Gujarat in 2002 when \u201cthey did not get together and mobilise strong protests all over the state demanding that the centre dismiss the Gujarat government under article 356, although it is beyond dispute that the functioning of the government was blatantly violative of the constitution\u201d. In that article of the 3rd of November 2007 Bidwai wrote that Manmohan Singh is yet to mention the G word. Even Bidwai in that article forgot to mention the Hindutwa Judgement though. \nV. N. Khare was succeeded on the 2nd of May 2004 by S. Rajendra Babu who was CJI for just a month. On the 1st of June 2004 Babu was succeeded by Ramesh Chandra Lahoti. Manmohan Singh had been sworn in as Prime Minister on the 22nd of May 2004. There is a photograph of Former Chief Justice of India Justice Ramesh Chandra Lahoti taken by Indian Photo Agency published on the 28th of March 2011 with a caption reading: \u201cfirebrand Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) activist Sadhvi Ritambhara and former Chief Justice of India Justice Ramesh Chandra Lahoti with BJP leader L.K.Advani on the occasion of release of a book Ramayan the hymns of Himalaya a prosaic English translation of the epic authored by Dr Akhikesh Gumashta. In New Delhi on Friday the 25th of March 2011.\u201d Need one say more. Would a CJI who after retirement chooses to consort with Hindutva fascists reverse the Hindutva judgement? On June 28th 2004 Lahotia said that only 18% of judges posts were filled in the country. But was that a reason to leave the Hindutva Judgement in place? No. Obviously he thought the judgement was right and saw no reason to open a debate even though in reality an appeal to religion is illegal. In any case the Congress party also never gave a fitting reply to Sushma Swaraj who promised to shave her head if Sonia Gandhi was made Prime Minister. Instead of defending the right of a naturalised citizen to all the rights and privileges of a natural born Indian citizen, the Congress government got a Hindu priest to offer a reply that tonsuring of head was \u201cun-Hindu\u201d. There was no attempt made by the Congress party to outlaw religion in public discourse. Rather the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and the Supreme Court bowed down before the power of Hindu discourse and the G word and the H word were never mentioned. In a letter to Outlook magazine in 2015 Lahotia criticised the mag for its anti BJP stance. He was obviously a Hindu and Hindutva supporter during his time as CJI. \nLahotia was succeeded on the 1st of November 2005 by Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal. Sabharwal upheld Parliament\u2019s decision to expel cash-for-vote MPs, and claimed the right of the SC to review Parliament\u2019s action. But there is no news anywhere of him urging Manmohan Singh to allow the Hindutva Judgement to be revisited or in any other way questioning the promise to build a Ram Temple in the BJP manifesto. In any case his sons benefitted from a case he heard through which land was cleared for development in Delhi. He was obviously not interested in preventing politicians getting to power by promoting enmity between classes. What is a bit of enmity if your sons get rich in the process. \nSabharwal was succeeded on the 13th of January 2007 by K. G. Balakrishnan. The RSS attacked him for being from Kerala and therefore a communist. But no one attacked him from any end of the political spectrum for being unwilling to enforce the RP Act. \nAnd so it went on. Balakrishna was succeeded on the 12th of May 2010 by S. H. Kapadia. Kapadia was succeeded on 29th September 2012 by Altamas Kabir. Kabir was succeeded on the 19th of July 2013 by P. Sathasivam. Sathasivam was succeeded on the 27th of April 2014 by Rajendra Mal Lodha. Lodha was succeeded on the 28th of September 2014 by H. L. Dattu. Dattu was succeeded on the 3rd of December 2015 by T. S. Thakur who is CJI today. \nIn the 1990s the combined charge of corruption and ineffective liberalisation paved the way for the Hindu nationalists who have been preparing to take over the country since before Independence. Hindus used the anti-corruption plank and minority appeasement language to mobilise qua Hindus. They brought corruption and pollution into a single focus of moral outrage. The Supreme Court and the Congress party were too weak to disbar them permanently from political life under the RP Act after having banned them temporarily after they demolished Babri Masjid. The BJP, RSS and VHP came back, the BJP with the same manifesto promise to build a Ram Temple, thanks to the Supreme Court that refused to call appeal to Hinduism an appeal to religion. \nToday Narendra Modi also applies the words corruption and pollution when talking about Muslims and how they have to \u201cpurify\u201d themselves if they want to remain part of the Hindu nation. Thus anti-corruption morphed into clean liberalisation to be executed by the Hindu BJP and the entire media and political Hindu fascist state machinery colluded. Assassination of Muslims by police is how the political parties maintain themselves in power, like how Nazis maintained themselves through genocide of Jews. \nIf India is a Hindu majority country, which may or may not be true, the Hindu majority are not particularly vigilant about preserving secular democracy. In any case given that fascism is based on Hinduism more and more groups will be defecting from Hinduism that is for sure. Constant education is needed to inculcate secular democratic values in a rapidly growing young population. But education does not serve the interests of the Hindus who want to keep Dalits, Adivasis, Other Backward Castes and Muslims and Sikhs in their ghettoes. Liberalism and capitalism and appeal to religion and what in India is termed communalism all adds up to fascism of Hindu elites as they give themselves power and money. Thus the 38% of voters who voted for the BJP in 2014 became the enemy of the constitution. In any case the rot had already set in with Nehru when he illegally disbanded the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly. \nThe illegality under the Representation of People Act 1951 of appeal to religion to garner votes was forgotten as the BJP became the anti-corruption party of Hindu nationalists to defeat Congress. Of course, the entire Sangh Parivar including BJP are the corrupt mafia par excellence in the country. The Verma Committee Report itself showed that the BJP/RSS/Sangh Parivar /Shiv Sena and other Sena gangs were an uncontrollable mafia, a parallel state. But amazingly, and certainly because the Congress itself was corrupt and operated the state institutions as its own mafia, Narendra Modi managed to keep the taint of corruption away from himself personally in the 2014 election campaign and even managed to protect Amit Shah who had engaged in multiple political assassinations to get himself and Narendra Modi to power. He thus succeeded Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister in 2014. \nIt would require an entire book to understand how Atal Bihari Vajpayee could manage to give the BJP a holier than though look vis-a-vis the Congress party in the eyes of the voters when he became Prime Minster with an absolute majority on the 19th of March 1998. Appeal to build a Ram Temple instead of being outlawed was somehow an appeal to incorruptibility and nationalism. The national media and television elevated a man steeped in RSS ideology and a founder of Hindu nationalism to a statesmanly level. His role in demolition of Babri Masjid on the 6th of December 1992 was forgotten. The Liberhan enquiry into the events of that day would take 17 years to deliver its report that the whole thing had been planned by the RSS of which A.B. Vajpayee has been an active member his entire life. The Liberhan report submitted on the 30th of June 2009 found the BJP\u2019s so-called moderate face guilty along with many other leaders of the BJP. But nothing has happened to them. They continue in politics. The delay in issuing the Liberhan report itself speaks volumes about how fascism maintains itself in the country. \nEven during the Manmohan Singh led Congress administration during the period 2004 to 2014 the Supreme Court of India could not get a grip on the illegal shootings by police in Madhya Pradesh (MP), ruled by the BJP. On the 29th of December 2007 Sunil Joshi, an RSS man, had been gunned down by his own associates as he was about to reveal details of the vast network of crime and terrorism against Muslims organised by the RSS. Today Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatya Janata Party (BJP) rules MP and half of India\u2019s states. The means to electoral victory is appeal to Hindu chauvinism. The modus operandus of the Sangh Parivar police or members of other institutions of state is to appeal to Hindu voters by assassinating Muslims. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangha (RSS) and other Sangh Parivar gangs use ideology culled from their leaders\u2019 writings to justify the murders. These gangs are indistinguishable from business fraternities. Often when petty criminals are killed the RSS claim it was a communal attack but in reality the murder is due to struggles between RSS business/mafia gangs. When Muslims are suspected it is invariably a false flag operation by Sangh Parivar to unleash Sangh Parivar controlled state agencies on innocent Muslims for no reason other than inflicting pain and establishing Hindu supremacy. RSS is also involved with the Vyapam scam in MP, hence the investigations into the deaths of those students are also deadly slow. The nexus between the BJP state government and central government and the police is all-encompassing. \nLast week the Central Bureau of Investigation, which, it hardly needs to be mentioned, is under the control of the central BJP government and Narendra Modi the Prime Minister, released without charge several BJP strongmen including the ex-Chief Minister of Karnataka Yeddiyurappa from prison. This is the mafia gang originally established by the Congress Chief Minister S.M.Krishna to rob the people of Bellary district of their agricultural livelihood by establishing mining industries. Narendra Modi released him and Yediyurappa is now free to win back Karnataka for the BJP from the ruling Congress party. His associate in crime, another Reddy, was allowed by the Supreme Court to take out a triumphant motorcade through Bellary to announce his daughter\u2019s marriage, despite the fact he is still on trial. This is the same CBI whose present Director said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t prevent rape enjoy it\u201d an apparently perfectly acceptable analogy for legalising gambling. \nThe present Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur recently took up the demand to look into the scope of section 123 (3) and (3A) of the RP Act. A miracle!! Arguments were conducted over two weeks. \nIt is expected that he will deliver a judgement on a narrow interpretation of the request for an authoritative and expeditious decision on interpretation of Article 123 (3-A) of the RP Act. He said he will not go into what is religion. \nAdvocate B.A. Desai during arguments had argued that a reference put to the bench is always a mix of fact and law. Here the entire appeal has been referred to this bench. The \u201cplank of Hindutva, Hindu and Hinduism\u201d are part of the reference and falls within the scope of section 123 (3) of the RP Act. \nThe judgement is awaited any time before Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur retires in January 2017. An offer from the CJI to interveners to be heard by a five-judge bench on the plank of Hindutva/Hindu/Hinduism has been made. \nCan we expect the Supreme Court to throw out fascism? The CPI(M) in its intervention on the last day of arguments expressed the hope that it will. We must wait both for the narrow judgement to be given before January by T.S.Thakur and also possibly for the five judge bench decision, if still needed after Thakur\u2019s judgement. \nOnly once that judgement is delivered will we know whether the protests of secular democratic Indians against fascism will be heard and assassinations such as those of 31st October this year can be avoided in the future. \nThe entire political establishment across all the Hindu supremacist parties are more interested in money than in social equality. The Congress, the BJP, the CJIs of the Supreme Court and the people who would eventually form into the Aam Admi Party are Hindus first and foremost, Aryan invaders who want to oppress the indigenous black-skinned Indians; they are the educated elites and their croneys from all castes and classes regard the workers and peasants simply as vote banks and as the labour resource to be used and thrown. BJP, Congress, Janata Dal and all the other United Front parties, as also Aam Admi Party and their offshoots, are unable to understand that the basic feature of the Indian constitution is justice, equality, secularism, socialism and fraternity. They have not raised the need to review the Hindutva Judgement all this time. They all are fascists. \nEight Muslim undertrials who were assassinated near Bhopal are martyrs to the cause of secular democracy. Appeal to religion in politics and unwillingness to overthrow the Hindutva Judgement is fascism. \nThis regime is illegal under the RP Act. Unless the RP Act is enforced fascism will continue to reign supreme. \nOnly the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its left front allies, and the Bahujan Samaj Party and its offshoots are separate from the fascist Hindu regime. \nCPI (M) and their left front partners and BSP and their offshoot parties who are upholding Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh (see Periyar and Ambedkar articles on Bhagat Singh published in countercurrents here and here) are the only secular democratic parties in India. We must save the people of India. \nConsidering one third of all seats in Parliament come from just three states namely UP, Bihar and West Bengal it is in those three states that fascism has to be annihilated. All efforts by the BSP, BMP, CPI(M) and CPI (ML) and CPI have to be concentrated there. \nFinally one cannot but be horrified that someone who purports to be a secular activist Javed Anand on television complained that at least one of the men assassinated on 31st October near Bhopal should have been kept alive so that the public could know what had happened. One simply cannot believe the level of cynical nationalism the comment displays on par with fascist politicians and police. In any case it is highly likely that Indresh Kumar who was behind the assassination of Sunil Joshi and who was the mastermind behind the Chishti Dargha murders and other Hindutva terrorist bombings is also behind the assassination of the eight men allegedly associated with SIMI. After all he is the master strategist for so-called security issues for Narendra Modi. A visible killing of Muslims was needed at Diwali time because targets in Kashmir are so far away and killing a Kashmiri or even a Pakistani is not as ideologically valuable as killing a mainland Muslim who shouldn\u2019t be here in the first place. Except, in fact, it is Indresh Kumar and his Hindu ilk, who are part of the invader Aryan dispensation, that should not be here, or at least should undergo reform, considering they unleashed this sectarian madness in India several millennia ago. \nIn his intervention at the Supreme Court hearing the CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury maintained that his party is also an affected party in this debate. \n\u201cAll that we want to know is if an appeal is made for votes in the name of his religion, then what is the meaning of the word his? Is it the religion of candidates or religion of agent or religion of the third party (seeking votes) or religion of voters or that of all of them?\u201d the bench observed. \u201cYechury\u2019s counsel senior advocate Sanjay Hedge advanced the arguments that there is more at stake. Not only law but also fact regarding what is religion is part of the discussion. The CPI (M), one of the six national parties of the country, became the first political entity to voluntarily join the legal debate in the apex court over the contentious issue. Yechury also took the opportunity to target the RSS. \u201cWith the communal and fascistic RSS-led combine\u2019s assuming power at the centre, systematic efforts are on to communalise the institutions of the state, the administration, the education system and the media.\u201d He also added, \u201cThe growth of majority communalism will strengthen the forces of minority communalism and endanger national unity.\u201d The CPI(M)\u2019s late move, underlining its secular credentials and also seeking an opportunity to launch attack on the BJP establishment, however, faced time constraints in the apex court.\u201d (Hindustan Times 28th of October 2016). Considering CPI (M) have also used the word fascist to describe TCM in West Bengal the word may have lost some of its meaning to them. But it has not for me. In India the RP Act has been overthrown. That to me is fascism. \nActually those efforts to communalise India started much before Modi won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014. In fact his victory was a culmination of the efforts to communalise India in the preceding 25 years, in fact it started earlier, indeed the seeds were sown with the Hindu invasion of India those many millennia ago. Only mass agitation can finally wrench the country from the fascists and allow us to enforce the constitution and the rule of law especially the RP Act. \nAnandi Sharan is an environmental historian and writer based at Bangalore.

                              "text": "The congressional GOP led by House Speaker Paul Ryan has been meeting this week to try to get Republican immigration legislation through the House. There is a deadline looming: next Tuesday, June 12th. Twenty-three of the most RINO-ish Republican representatives have been pushing for a discharge petition. [House Republican factions hunt for immigration deal, By Alan Fram And Lisa Mascaro, AP, June 7, 2018]  The House rules\u2014I tell ya, I've been reading up this stuff, and God! do I need a drink\u2014the House rules say that a discharge petition can only be brought up on the second and fourth Monday of each month.  Hence the deadline. If the 23 RINOs can get a majority of House members to sign on to it by next Tuesday, on June 25 the House will have to consider\u2014to actually vote on\u2014four proposals for immigration legislation that have been stuck in committee. By House rules one of those proposals\u2014the one that gets most votes\u2014will pass and go to the Senate.  As Radio Derb goes to tape, the RINOs are three votes short. [Discharged? House Republicans Inch Closer to an Immigration Showdown, by Haley Byrd, Weekly Standard, June 8, 2018]  Supposing this discharge petition is voted up next week, what would that mean for immigration?  A clue: which House members have actually signed the petition. There are of course the 23 RINOs who've been pushing the thing. Who else? All but one of the House Democrats\u2014192 of the blighters. [Who has signed the DACA discharge petition, CNN, June 6, 2018]So if the discharge petition goes through, the House will end up passing Democrat-approved legislation, which of course means a huge mass Amnesty in return for nothing at all.  And this is in fact what a great many other House Republicans want\u2014including Paul Ryan. So why aren't they all signing the discharge petition?  Because House Republicans are pulled two ways. Pulling them to the Left are their big-money donors , who want cheap labor. Pulling them to their Right are their voters, who want restrictions on immigration.  For a GOP congresscritter to sign that discharge petition would be to stick a big fat finger in the eye of his voter base. Few of them\u201423 is the actual number\u2014are shameless enough to do that.  Speaker Ryan, who is of course a Republican, is looking at the prospect of the House passing Democrat legislation on a key issue five months before midterm elections. Eeeek! So he called the meeting to assure the House GOP that their leadership will have an immigration bill of their own any day now\u2014so don't sign that petition! Please!  What will Ryan's legislation look like? With a Republican President in the White House, congressional Republicans feel they have to make a show of deferring to the President's proposals when cooking up legislation.  In the case of immigration, our President's proposals were spelled out for the nation back in late January. We here at VDARE.com of course passed comments on them at the time .  The President's proposals have, for purposes of reference, been collapsed down Chinese-style into a handy numerical slogan: the Four Pillars of Immigration Reform:  Mass amnesty for two million illegal aliens who came here as minors, or can produce fake documentation to that effect  Twenty-five billion dollars for border security, explicitly including a proper wall along our southern border.  Severe reductions in the scope of chain migration.  An end to the diversity-visa lottery.  Those are Trump's Four Pillars. From our point of view\u2014the point of view of patriotic conservatives who want sane, rational policies on settlement and citizenship to the benefit of current U.S. citizens\u2014they fall considerably short. They don't, for example, mention birthright citizenship, or compulsory E-Verify, or the Refugee Resettlement rackets , or the rain forest of guest-worker programs keeping American wages down.  But the President's proposals, if implemented in law and properly enforced, would be a huge improvement.  What is the chance we shall actually get them? Not good.  A major problem: Paul Ryan himself. In the psychic tug-of-war for the Republican soul between wealthy donors and Republican voters, Ryan has been clearly and consistently on the side of the Chamber of Commerce, the Koch Brothers, Sheldon Adelson etc. That's not mere empty abuse on my part, either. There's a long paper trail in evidence here: VDARE.com has been tracking Ryan for years .  In fairness to the House Speaker, I think some application of the Napoleon Principle is appropriate here ( It's not clear that the Napoleon Principle actually was stated by Napoleon but it\u2019s an important rule):  Never ascribe to malice that which can be explained by stupidity.  So how much of Speaker Ryan's cucky RINOtude is cynical calculation for his own advancement, and how much is just native stupidity?  Given that Ryan has announced he will not be running for re-election, with the corresponding assumption that he will, after leaving the House, sink into an extravagantly-remunerated career as a congressional lobbyist; and that, aged only 48, his career will last at least a couple of decades, bringing him in many tens of millions\u2014quite possibly hundreds of millions\u2014of dollars, you have to suspect an element of careerist ambition.  On the other hand, my impression has always been that, on the subject of immigration, the stupidity factor in Ryan's case is at least as important as the careerist one. His recorded statements on immigration issues reflect the stalest, corniest tropes of immigration sentimentality: Nation of immigrants! Who we are! Ellis Island! Famine ships! Statue of Liberty!  My best guess on the careerism-stupidity ratio in Ryan's motivations is that for most of his career it hovered around one part careerism to three parts stupidity. Now, with retirement from the House coming up, and the lobbying firms hammering on his door, it's probably swung round to something like the reverse: three parts careerism to one part stupidity.  If I\u2019m right even roughly-approximately right, there's not much hope for policies that stick close to the President's Four Pillars  What the GOP House leadership will most likely propose: mass Amnesty garnished with some vague, easily-evaded promises about a technological solution to border security\u2014cameras, drones, and so on\u2014together possibly with some equally vague, equally easily-avoidable noise about stricter interior enforcement.  What about the Senate? It's hard to be optimistic. Serving those six-year terms, Senators in general are less bothered about pleasing their voters than House members.  Republican senators are also cuckier. I just went through the score cards at NumbersUSA , counting up House and Senate Republicans by grade on recent immigration votes. Down in the really bad grades\u2014C, D, and F\u2014the numbers are not that different: 34 percent of House Republicans versus 26 percent of Senators. Up in the As and Bs there's a much bigger difference. Thirty-two percent of House Republicans scored As, against only ten percent of Senators. GOP Senators bunch up in the cucky Bs, 63 percent of them.  So it's hard to see much hope for real reform from the Senate, even if the House were to pass it out.  If the Senators saw enough of a wind getting up among the voters, they would of course trim their sails. It would take a startling result in the midterms to get their attention, though\u2014too late for this current round of legislative proposals. The Senate will most likely do nothing.  What about the President? Presumably any legislation that landed on his desk would be signed, or not, according to whether it came close enough to January's Four Pillars.  OK, but how close? A mass Amnesty and border wall but nothing on chain migration or the diversity-visa lottery?  Eh, maybe.  What about Mass Amnesty garnished with a lot of fluffy, insincere, disposable promises about surveillance drones on the border and increased funding for ICE? Would Trump veto that?  I'm not at all sure that he would. I hope he would, of course, but my faith is not strong.  For one thing, the President has been feeble on immigration. This was surely the one issue more than any other that won him the presidency; yet he seems strangely oblivious of the fact.  We hear from the President time and again that he'd love to do something about immigration but his hands are constitutionally tied, he can only keep urging Congress to pass legislation.  That's not true, as commenters keep pointing out. Sample:  According to the Congressional Research Service under expedited removal, both administrative and judicial review are limited to cases in which the alien claims to be a U.S. citizen or to have been previously admitted as a legal immigrant. Nobody else has an entitlement to demand entry into our country and access to the courts. It would be nice to tighten up the statute, but there is nothing stopping Trump from interpreting it properly today. [How Trump can protect the border without Congress by Daniel Horowitz; Conservative Review, April 4th 2018.]  It's true the President can't do a whole lot, especially in the zone of legal immigration. There are some things he can do, though, and he's mostly not doing them.  The impression I've been getting is that the National Question isn't often at the front of Trump's mind. It does get dragged to the front now and then, when some advisor\u2014Stephen Miller, perhaps\u2014holds Trump's attention for a few minutes; or when, as now, the forthcoming electoral consequences of ignoring the National Question are unavoidably obvious.  It's not a heart issue with him, though, as it is with those of us who've been badgering on about it for years.  It surely takes second place in Trump's mind to personal grievances and antagonisms. Every immigration patriot's favorite government employee today is Jeff Sessions, who actually has been trying to do some of the things the Executive can do without the need for new laws.  The President has continued to express his unhappiness with Sessions\u2019 recusing himself from the Russia investigation. This last week he tweet that if Sessions had told him before recusing himself, quote , \"I would have quickly picked someone else.\" This was a year and a quarter after the event. Talk about bearing a grudge!  Meanwhile Jeff Sessions' dogged efforts to improve immigration law enforcement have apparently gone un-noticed by the President.  Other personnel issues that leave one wondering how much we can hope for from this President. Perhaps the biggest: Marc Short, Trump's Director of Legislative Affairs.  The meaning of that job title is, this guy is the President's main liaison to Congress. For example, he sat in, representing the President, on that Thursday morning meeting in the Capitol basement, the meeting where Cucky Ryan promised to forestall next week's discharge petition with immigration legislation of his own. [Former Koch Exec Marc Short Overseeing Amnesty Plan that Breaks with Trump\u2019s Immigration Principles, by Joh Binder, Breitbart.com, June 7, 2018]  So what do we know about Marc Short? Well, Marc Short had been a consultant for the Marco Rubio campaign. Not just out of nominative solidarity with Marco, either: He was a strong Never Trumper . He also consulted for Mike Pence, though; that was apparently his foot in the door of the Trump administration.  Before becoming a Never Trumper, Short had spent four years as President of Freedom Partners, a lobbying group run by and financed by the fanatically open-borders Koch brothers.  The Koch brothers; Never Trumpers; Marco Rubio; that's some weird r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a senior political position on the staff of a President aiming at patriotic immigration reform.  And Marc Short is just the tip of the personnel iceberg. Why is Kirstjen Nielsen still in charge at Homeland Security? She's obviously clueless; although to be fair to the President, this fact seems to be dawning on him, to judge by his May 9th rage against her in a cabinet meeting. [Kirstjen Nielsen, Chief of Homeland Security, Almost Resigned After Trump Tirade, By Michael D. Shear and Nicole Perlroth, NYT, May 10, 2018] So fire her, Mr. President.

Greetings, listeners, from your paschally genial host John Derbyshire, here to offer some observations on the week's news from a Dissident Right viewpoint.  In this week's podcast I attend a lecture, chronicle some cuckery, draw some elegant literary analogies, and take side trips to Arizona, China, and 1958. I close with a flourish of theological and philosophical apothegms, and some music by Richard Wagner.  If that doesn't leave you thoroughly sated, I shall have to start adding recipes.  02 \u2014 The war on citizenship. Eye-opener of the week for me was a talk I attended in New York City, given by political scientist Hans von Spakovsky. The talk was organized by CIS, the Center for Immigration Studies, who are a Washington D.C.-based outfit, but who do a couple of events a year in New York.  Von Spakovsky toils in the vineyards of what we on the Dissident Right refer to dismissively as \"Conservatism, Inc.\" He held minor executive-branch positions in the George W. Bush administration. He's currently a fellow at the Heritage Foundation , an organization that shall dwell for ever in the odium of having fired young researcher Jason Richwine at the behest of CultMarx ideological enforcers. Von Spakovsky also writes for National Review , a different organization but likewise not best known for firmness of spine in standing up to progressive witch-hunters.  I therefore took my seat at the von Spakovsky lecture bearing low expectations and a large glass of Cabernet Sauvignon to aid in falling asleep, should my senses be dulled to somnolence by bland neoconnery.  To my pleasant surprise, von Spakovsky's talk was coherent, engaging, revealing, and thought-provoking. The title of it was, \"How noncitizen voting threatens our democracy.\" That's what the man spoke about for forty-five minutes, with examples, statistics, and some colorful anecdotes.  Bottom line: This is a real problem, one we don't pay half enough attention to. Some jottings at random from my notes.  1. California, encouraged by the Obama administration, gives drivers licenses to illegal aliens. That's bad enough. Worse is this: When acquiring a license, the applicant is automatically registered to vote, unless he specifically asks not to be. Close to a million illegals have been given licenses since the motor-voter law came in two years ago.  2. When you get a form from your local County Court asking you to register for jury duty, one of the questions on the form is: \"Are you a U.S. citizen?\" (As it happens, my wife got this form just the other day; and, yes, the question is right there.) In most jurisdictions, including mine, the address lists for these forms to be sent out to are compiled from the voter registration rolls for the district. So (a) anyone ticking the \"No\" box to that question is admitting to being on the voter registration rolls improperly: but (b) jury duty being a duty \u2014 a chore \u2014 not a pleasure, there is strong incentive to tick the \"No\" box, to get out of jury duty. Some subset of people who do this will vote, thereby breaking the law. Note that this applies to both legal and illegal aliens.  3. Scholarly researches have come up with a figure of 6.4 percent of noncitizens \u2014 legal and illegal resident aliens \u2014 voting in the 2008 election.  4. Attempts to bring these and related issues to the attention of the Obama Justice Department \u2014 issues of voter fraud whose perps could be identified by some easy low-level data mining \u2014 were greeted with total lack of interest.  That's just a sample of points from von Spakovsky's talk. He published a book about this in 2012, title Who's Counting? co-written with veteran conservative analyst John Fund. I'm ashamed to say I haven't read the book; although other VDARE.com writers have noticed it . We've written about the efforts of von Spakovsky, Fund, and others to get some order and integrity into our voter-registration processes.  This is supposed to be the age of Big Data, when not a sparrow falls but some government or commercial outlet somewhere can tell you the age, birthplace, color, educational history, marital status, sexual orientation, and purchasing habits of the sparrow. Yet in the matter of voter registration, one of the foundations of our republican institutions, the computer may as well not have been invented.  This is true at the most basic level. A lady known to me moved from her family home in a certain state to live with her husband in a different state. The voter-registration form sent to her family home in the original state continued to show her name. She wrote to the registrar in that state, telling him she was now resident elsewhere, and should be removed from that state's rolls.  Nothing happened. She wrote again; again, nothing. Some years later, despite her efforts to be a good citizen, she is still a registered voter in two states. This, von Spakovsky said, is very common.  Another big take-away from his talk was the ruthless, relentless, unblinking efforts by CultMarx bastions like the ACLU to stamp hard on any suggestion for reform. Local politicians and county officials are terrified to do anything about situations like that of my friend. They know that if they do try to clean up the voter rolls, someone from one of these busybody progressive outfits will show up with a battalion of lawyers in tow and camp out in front of the county courthouse, staffed-up and financed \u2014 very well-financed \u2014 to litigate the matter to death.  The deep ideological purpose here is quite plain: To erase the distinction between citizens and resident aliens, both legal and illegal.  Cultural Marxists detest the nation-state. The citizen-noncitizen distinction is, to them, Jim Crow. Any effort to restrain noncitizen voting is, in the CultMarx mind, the thin end of a wedge whose thick end is separate drinking fountains for noncitizens.  That ideological purpose is itself just the hard core in a cloud of fluffy anti-nationalism that blankets all of Western society nowadays.  Five years ago I reviewed Steven Pinker's excellent book about the decline of violence. Pinker's an extremely intelligent and mostly sensible fellow, but even he couldn't resist a gratuitous swipe at the concept of a nation-state.  If we are going to preserve our civilization, this default trans-nationalism has to be challenged everywhere it shows itself.  President Trump said back in January that his Justice Department would conduct a major inquiry into voter fraud, presumably including noncitizen voting. Will he actually follow through on that, or will it be swallowed up, like so many of his other promises, in the Big Cuck?  Ah, the Big Cuck! Let's take a look at that.  03 \u2014 The Big Cuck. [Clip: \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye.\"]  Donny, we hardly knew ye. Like the Irish soldier who came back from the wars without arms, legs, or eyes, our President has emerged from White House personnel struggles looking very different from the candidate we cheered on to victory last fall.  As Radio Derb went to tape last Friday we were just digesting the news of U.S. cruise missile strikes against an air base in Syria, a nation with whom we had no argument and which had harmed no Americans or American national interests. As I commented last week: \"So much for 'America First.'\"  The Syria attack generated a lot of good-quality commentary, from every conceivable point of view. A minor industry sprang up, generating theories about what really happened, and why.  I confess my own interest in those theories is at a very low level. Believe whichever one you like. I'm mainly just annoyed about being forced to think about the Middle East and its interminable tribal squabbles, or Mr Putin and his rusting hulk of a country.  Let the buggers kill, cook, and eat each other: I couldn't care less. We have major pressing issues to deal with here in the U.S.A. Let's give them our full attention \u2026 please?  Lefty commentators were mostly just crowing about how unhappy we Deplorables are over the attack. \"Those racists thought they had put one of their own in the White House! Turns out he's just another neocon Republican-bot. Nyah nyah!\" That was the general tone.  Leaving all that aside, and postponing to another time the weird inversion whereby Cultural Marxists are now the War Party, commentators more sympathetic to Trump covered a pretty wide spectrum.  Representative of one end of that spectrum was blogger and Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams, who posted on Friday last a seven-point rationale for the action. Bombing Syria, said Adams, scotched the charges that Trump is Putin's puppet; it set the table for talking to China about North Korea; it prompted Iran to be more flexible when talking about their nuclear program; and so on.  At the other end of the spectrum was the blogger we know as Z-man, also posting last Friday. Title of his post: Donald Herbert Walker Trump. That sets us up for an extended parallel between President Trump and the first President Bush. Sample quotes from the Z-man, edited:  The '88 election was a landslide for Bush and a lot of sensible people thought that he would be the finishing touches to the new conservative majority \u2026 His famous pledge to never raise taxes was the cornerstone of his pitch \u2026 When Bush broke his promise, a year into his presidency, his voters were crushed. Bush was a liar. History is written by the victors and that means the Left, so we're always told that Bush lost in '92 because Clinton was sent by the void where God once existed, to bring joy and bliss to the blessed and smite the wicked. The truth is, Bush lost because the core of his voters rightly saw him as a liar and a fink.  End quote. Naturally, I come down on the Z-man's side in this argument. I understand of course that when speaking on the campaign trail, a man is not upon oath . Every presidential candidate I can recall across thirty years has promised that if elected, he will move our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. None of those elected has ever done it. We all understand that it's just a pitch for one small voter segment.  There are core issues, though, that define a candidate and inspire tens of millions of us to vote for him. America First nationalism was Trump's core issue. With that gone, he is fatally weakened.  If the President showed some awareness of what he has done to his base, there would be grounds for hope. Instead, he has doubled down on the cuckery.  Syria wasn't a one-off cuck; this was just the biggest, most visible betrayal \u2014 just one component of the Big Cuck.  No sooner was the President through bombing Syria, he had a carrier group in motion headed for northeast Asia to do something or other \u2014 attack, threaten, intimidate \u2014 North Korea, another country with which we have no differences of substance.  On the campaign trail last spring, candidate Trump told us that, precise quote: [Clip: \"NATO is obsolete.\"] That wasn't a misquote, either. The obsolescence of NATO was a regular campaign theme. Here's candidate Trump in July: [Clip: \"I said it's obsolete, and it is. It's obsolete.\"] A few minutes googling turned up two more clips.  Trump wanted us to know that NATO is obsolete. So it is; it became obsolete when the Warsaw Pact was disbanded twenty-six years ago.  Well, those statements are now no longer operational. We have that from the President's own mouth, speaking on Wednesday this week. [Clip: \"I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete.\"]  I wonder what else is \"no longer\" the case in President Trump's world. Does the Earth still orbit the Sun? Is Bismarck still the capital of North Dakota? Is it still the case that two plus two equals four? Or have we passed over into some postmodern style of presidency, where words are merely an expression of power relations, and Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia?  So NATO stands, and our obligations under the NATO charter are as firm as ever. If Russia invades Estonia, we are at war with Russia.  Eighty-four days in to the Trump Presidency, and we have already gone from \"America First\" to \"Estonia First.\"  04 \u2014 The Flight 93 Election brings us the Tom Wolfe White House. The cuckery is not merely geostrategic, either. On anything to do with the National Question, we Trump voters are being stiffed.  It has been 4 weeks since President Trump announced his 120-day \"moratorium\" on refugee resettlement as part of the court-halted Executive Order. And, for the umpteenth time, I repeat that the President did not have to even announce any \"moratorium\" or put it in an Executive Order! He has the power to simply stop the processing! G.W. Bush loved refugees, yet at this rate Trump will bring in more refugees than Bush. Bush's average is about 58,000 [per annum]. At the rate of admission for this past week, Trump will surpass that number \u2026 On March 30th we were stunned to learn that they were aiming to bring in 900 refugees a week through the remainder of the fiscal year that ends on September 30th. If he and Tillerson keep that pace they will admit around 60,000 this year which is near the average number we have admitted since 9/11 \u2026 Going back to the date that the \"moratorium\" was supposed to begin on March 16th the Trump State Department has admitted 2,496 refugees \u2026 Topping the list are 335 Syrians! 327 of those are Muslims.  On refugee resettlement, for example. Here's a quote from Ann Corcoran, the indefatigable, indispensable chronicler of this topic, posting on Thursday this week, edited quotes End quote. Also on the National Question, March 30th the President nominated Kevin McAleenan to lead CBP. That's U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security in charge of guarding our nation's borders.  How much of a cuck is that? I'm not sure, not having been able to find much on McAleenan's views and record. There are bad signs, though. ABC News on Friday reported that, quote:  Top Homeland Security officials from not only past Republican administrations but also Barack Obama's administration have signed onto a letter to Congress expressing \"enthusiastic support\" for President Trump's pick to lead border enforcement.  Uh-oh. Breitbart reports widespread feelings of betrayal among actual Border Patrol agents.  There is economic cuckery, too. Candidate Trump called China a currency manipulator; President Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, said, quote: \"They're not currency manipulators.\" Candidate Trump blasted Fed chief Janet Yellen as a tool of Barack Obama; President Trump told the Journal, quote: \"I like her. I respect her.\"  It can't be helping that President Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 do you have any idea how hard it is to not pronounce that as \"Munchkin\"? \u2014 Secretary Mnuchin and Director of the President's National Economics Council Gary Cohn have between the two of them an aggregate 44 years employment at Goldman Sachs on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.  So this populist insurgency against transnational elites has its major economic decision-making in the hands of two long-serving alumni of the flagship institution of globalist banking interests.  Whether or not the Z-man is right that we have elected another Poppy Bush, we sure as hell haven't elected another William Jennings Bryan. Quote from him: \"The issue of money is a function of the government and \u2026 the banks should go out of the governing business,\" end quote.  On trade, too: It's possible Trump has cucked out on China. I'll deal with that in a later segment.  What on earth is going on? Current speculations center on the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner. Both are standard-issue metropolitan liberals, the speculations go. They are serving as a conduit into the Oval Office for metropolitan-liberal views and sensibilities; and the conduit has flooded the damn place.  I don't know if that's true or not. If it is, it brings to mind Charlie Croker, hero of Tom Wolfe's 1998 novel A Man in Full. Charlie's a rough-diamond good ol' boy who's made a fortune in real estate development. His trophy second wife is an urban sophisticate devoted to the New York Times Art and Style sections. Tom Wolfe has much fun with the clash of outlooks there, most notably in the stud farm scene in Chapter 12.  So maybe that's it, with Trump's daughter playing the trophy-wife role. Cherchez la femme is a pretty reliable working principle in human affairs.  The Progressives warned us that if we elected Trump we'd end up in a George Orwell novel. In fact, we may have ended up in one of Tom Wolfe's.  I wouldn't be surprised. Orwell is good for making your flesh creep; but for the realities of life in today's U.S.A., most especially the realities of class, style, and influence, Wolfe is hard to beat.  Or perhaps it's been just inattention and incompetence on the part of the President himself. Michael Anton famously warned us that last year's contest was the Flight 93 Election. Quote from him:  Charge the cockpit or you die. You may die anyway. You \u2014 or the leader of your party \u2014 may make it into the cockpit and not know how to fly or land the plane. There are no guarantees.  End quote. No, there weren't. It was the Flight 93 Election, and our guy made it into the cockpit. Now we find out where he's taking the plane.  05 \u2014 Jeff to the border. But \u2026 we still have Jeff Sessions.  I'm starting to worry a bit that Radio Derb will succumb to a formula. First you'll get a depressed, angry segment or two on something stupid, crazy, or just wrong that President Trump has done. Then you'll get an upbeat segment on Attorney General Sessions' ongoing efforts to drain the Justice Department swamp and see that the people's laws are firmly but fairly enforced.  I shall try to avoid being that formulaic, I promise. A-G Sessions has certainly been cheering me up, though.  Tuesday this week Sessions was down at the southern border to see the state of affairs there for himself. He made a good stirring speech, promising to hire new immigration judges and firm up immigration enforcement procedures in U.S. Attorney offices nationwide. He spoke angrily about the drug traffickers and other criminals who've been taking advantage of our lackadaisical law enforcement, and promised a new era of serious border protection.  That drove progressives nuts. The New York Times, plaything of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, published a honking editorial on Sessions' visit, sample quote:  Mr. Sessions and the administration are being led by their bleak vision to the dark side of the law. The pieces are falling into place for the indiscriminate \"deportation force\" that the president promised.  End quote. Mr Slim and his elves at the New York Times apparently don't know that the U.S.A. already has a deportation force, and has had one since the U.S. Border Patrol was founded in 1924. It's called, duh, the U.S. Border Patrol.  Sessions made his speech at the border town of Nogales, Arizona. Congresscritter Ra\u00fal Grijalva, who represents Nogales and its county, put out a news release ahead of Sessions' visit saying, inter alia \u2014 or perhaps that should be entre otras \u2014 quote: \"The question is not whether or not [the administration's] policies meet the needs of our borderlands, but rather, will they even bother to learn what those needs actually are? So far, the answer has been a resounding no.\" End quote.  Rep. Grijalva is a Hispanic supremacist, a former stalwart of the irredentist and anti-white Raza Unida Party \u2014 \"Raza Unida\" means \"United Race\" \u2014 with an F-minus grade on immigration from NumbersUSA. That he represents Nogales is not at all surprising: the U.S. Census bureau listed Nogales as 95 percent Hispanic or Latino in the 2010 census.  As it happens I was in Nogales nine years ago this week. My strongest impression of the place was of fatness. It may very well be the fat capital of America. Concerning what Rep. Grijalva is pleased to call \"the needs of our borderlands,\" to judge by Nogales, the foremost need is some education in healthy eating.  That aside, Nogales is hardly in the U.S.A. at all. You don't see anybody white or black and nobody speaks English.  It was heartening to hear Sessions siccing U.S. attorneys nationwide on the problem of illegals.  I live in Suffolk County, New York, several hundred miles from the southern border. The big story in my county this week was the discovery, in a pleasant little town park fifteen miles from my front door, of the decomposing corpses of four young men, ages 16 to 20, who were murdered and then dumped there sometime in the last few days. Our County Police Commissioner told us that, quote: \"They all suffered from significant trauma throughout their body,\" end quote. That's a cop's way of saying they were tortured to death.  These are killings by the Salvadoran gang MS-13, which is rampant in the area. Last September, in a different park close by, two 16-year-old girls were found dead, likewise tortured. Ten Salvadorans have been arrested and charged with those killings. All are illegal aliens. One of them was deported in 2010 but sneaked back into the country four years later.  Waiting at my town railroad station Tuesday afternoon for a train into Manhattan to hear Hans von Spakovsky speak, I was on the platform there waiting with forty or fifty other travellers, most of them Central Americans chatting in Spanish. On a statistical basis, it's not unlikely there were MS-13 gangbangers among them.  We others, we handful of gringos, hung around in the background exchanging looks that said, pretty plainly: \"What the hell happened to my country?\"  This was on Long Island, in a county named for an English county, where the towns have old English or Dutch names, twelve hundred miles from the southern border.  Enough of this. It has to stop. That's why we elected you, Mr. President. Let the Syrians, the Russians, and the Koreans go to Hell by any route they choose. This needs fixing. Fix it! \u2026 Or we'll start looking for someone that will.  06 \u2014 Sessions, Holder, and Orwell. Just a footnote to the above, brought to mind by having mentioned Orwell and then Hans von Spakovsky again.  Von Spakovsky was very good on the shameless determination of Eric Holder's Justice Department to do nothing at all about voter fraud. It's something he knows about: in fact he and John Fund co-wrote another book on exactly this topic, title Obama's Enforcer: Eric Holder's Justice Department , published three years ago.  Watching Jeff Sessions speaking in Nogales the day after I attended that lecture, the contrast between the two Attorneys General jumped out at me.  I don't mean the contrast in political or jurisprudential viewpoints. There's that, of course; but that's just intellectual disagreement. The contrast that struck me was one of deep-ingrained attitudes to the law; and the contrast was, to put it very bluntly, between the Anglo-Saxon attitude \u2014 \"Anglo-Saxon-Celtic,\" if you want to be finicky about it \u2014 and \u2026 other.  George Orwell, in one of his essays about the English character, said the following thing, quote:  The masses still more or less assume that \"against the law\" is a synonym for \"wrong.\" It is known that the criminal law is harsh and full of anomalies and that litigation is so expensive as always to favour the rich against the poor: but there is a general feeling that the law, such as it is, will be scrupulously administered \u2026 An Englishman does not believe in his bones, as a Spanish or Italian peasant does, that the law is simply a racket.  Here one comes upon an all-important English trait: the respect for constitutionalism and legality, the belief in \"the law\" as something above the State and above the individual, something which is cruel and stupid, of course, but at any rate incorruptible. It is not that anyone imagines the law to be just. Everyone knows that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. But no one accepts the implications of this, everyone takes it for granted that the law, such as it is, will be respected, and feels a sense of outrage when it is not. Remarks like \"They can't run me in; I haven't done anything wrong,\" or \"They can't do that; it's against the law,\" are part of the atmosphere of England. The professed enemies of society have this feeling as strongly as anyone else. One sees it in \u2026 letters to the papers from eminent Marxist professors, pointing out that this or that is a \"miscarriage of British justice.\" Everyone believes in his heart that the law can be, ought to be, and, on the whole, will be impartially administered. The totalitarian idea that there is no such thing as law, there is only power, has never taken root. Even the intelligentsia have only accepted it in theory.  End quote. In another essay, Orwell enlarged on that theme, long quote End long quote. The first of those essays was written just after WW2 ended and the Brits were feeling exceptionally pleased with themselves; the second was written earlier, during the Blitz.  Still, even discounting for the nationalist buzz that Orwell and his countrymen were enjoying at the time, there is definitely something in what he wrote.  Jeff Sessions represents that older Anglo-Saxon sensibility. Eric Holder represented something quite fundamentally different, something close to what Orwell's \"Spanish or Italian peasant\" believed: that the law is simply a racket, a way for the powerful to buttress and preserve their power, and to practice spite against categories of people they dislike \u2014 in Eric Holder's case, towards non-elite white Americans.  I'm sure the contrast is a real one, but I can't explain why it is so. Eric Holder was born and raised in the U.S.A., which is an Anglo-Saxon creation. His family came from Barbados, which was a British colony for three centuries. On those bases, I guess we can rule out nurture. That leaves us with nature; or at best, nature qualified with lifetime immersion in the postmodern intellectual counterculture.  I'd like to think \u2014 there's no way to know, of course, but I do think and believe \u2014 that Jeff Sessions, confronted with the kind of evidence of massive voter fraud that Hans von Spakovsky and John Fund sent to the Justice Department, would have acted vigorously to put a stop to it, without any thought for the political consequences for the faction he supported.  \"These are our laws \u2014 our laws, the people's laws \u2014 enacted by the people's representatives according to longstanding customary procedures. They are being mocked, violated, ignored. That has to stop.\"  That's the sum total of the thoughts that would have gone through the head of a patriotic conservative such as I believe Jeff Sessions to be. It's the law; it needs to be impartially administered; its judgments need to be firmly enforced.  That's it. That's the mindset Orwell identified. You don't find it much outside the Anglosphere. If we lose it, we're no better than Syria or Russia, China or Zimbabwe. In those places the law is just a tool with which the powerful can crush the skulls of their enemies \u2026 which was more or less Eric Holder's position.  It was shocking and horrible, during the Obama administration, to see that latter mentality abroad in the U.S.A.  I wish long life and good health to our Attorney General, and many more years of service to our republic.  07 \u2014 Squid ink on the China summit. Last week I promised a report on President Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Here's my report.  The one great big thing in the front of Xi Jinping's mind is the 19th Party Congress coming up this fall, a stage-managed affair at which Xi will win another five-year term against no allowed opposition, and will pack even more of his yes-men into the ChiCom apparatus of government.  For this, Xi wants to look good to his people, so they'll accept the results of the Congress without too much grumbling, or any unsightly public protests that would oblige him to put tanks on the streets, or \u2014 worst of all \u2014 any intraparty factional fights.  Our President obliged, acting the soul of respect and hospitality. From the outside, it was a friendly meeting between men who respect each other.  But what was said between Trump and Xi?  We don't of course know. We have to do the best we can by deciphering what the two parties said about what was said. The indications are: Nothing much.  Here for example, was Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at last Friday's briefing, quote:  So I think we think the restructuring of the dialogue and having specifically a breakout that will address comprehensive economic opportunities across our different agencies both here and within China I think we felt was very productive, very good start in how we're going to structure it, and again, very specific things that we talked about to look forward on making progress in the short term on.  So what Mnuchin said about what was said is some content-free boilerplate observations about what he thinks we think.  I took that quote from Gordon Chang's report in Forbes magazine. Chang points out that there are real live Americans, lots of them, who are being hurt by Chinese trade practices \u2014 our steelworkers, for example, put out of their jobs by Chinese dumping. These workers are not likely to be satisfied by some Goldman Sachs alumnus putting out a cloud of squid ink about \"restructuring dialogue\" and \"addressing comprehensive economic opportunities.\"  There had been stories before last week's meeting that President Trump was about to issue an executive order against the dumping of steel into our markets. There has been no action on that, though; and when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was asked about it at a press conference, he blew out more squid ink.  Bottom line looks to me like: Xi is too preoccupied with his upcoming Congress to bother much about American concerns; Trump is too preoccupied with babies in Syria to push forcefully for the trade changes he campaigned on.  Does that justify Gordon Chang's headline, quote: Did Trump Just Roll Over On China Trade? I don't myself believe it does; but you have to think \u2014 or perhaps, as Secretary Mnuchin might say, you have to think you think \u2014 more might have been achieved.  In fairness I should declare myself a skeptic, in a general way, on Gordon Chang's pessimism, when I recall that I reviewed his book The Coming Collapse of China \u2026 mm, let me see \u2026 yes, sixteen years ago.  And while we're thinking about what we think about China, let's never lose sight of what a corrupt, lawless despotism the communists are running over there.  There is a useful update on this in the March issue of Literary Review, where Lucy Popescu, on behalf of PEN \u2014 that's P-E-N, the worldwide association of poets, essayists, and novelists \u2014 Lucy has an article on the persecution of dissident writers in China and in Chinese-occupied Tibet and Eastern Turkestan.  It's their business, and I have no desire to go to war with the ChiComs. It's good to be reminded, though, that while our President and media are blathering about what an evil, cruel man Bashar al-Assad is, Assad's government prior to the current civil war was far less repressive than China's was, and is, and continues to be.  And that while we are encouraged to obsess about a crazy dictator in North Korea brandishing nukes, China just forty years ago was emerging from Mao Tse-tung's Great Cultural Revolution, an episode of systemic breakdown and collective madness at least as alarming, and also nuclear-armed.  08 \u2014 Miscellany. And now, our closing miscellany of brief items.  Imprimis: Just a follow-up on Hans von Spakovsky's lecture about voter fraud.  Hans posed the following thought experiment: Imagine if all the lawyering, political activism, and M-O-N-E-Y that goes into deterring and litigating against efforts to clean up the voter-registration rolls, imagine if all that energy were directed into setting up voter education facilities where people with no photo i.d. could be instructed in how to get some.  That came to mind when I read yesterday's post by Brenda Walker here at VDARE.com about the 86-year-old veteran whose VA card, issued back in the 1960s, had no photograph. He lives in Texas, where a law was passed six years ago mandating picture i.d. for voting.  Put up billboards and run TV ads telling people who to call for instructions on getting photo i.d. It would be way cheaper than all the activism and litigation.  Why don't progressives want to do this? See if you can figure it out.  Item: A great social issue of our time, all over the Western world, is: What will become of the left-hand side of the IQ Bell Curve? The orthodox, politically-correct answer is: We'll retrain them all as software engineers. I'm assuming that you, like me, find that answer jejune.  The evidence is mounting, and has been laid out in books like Charles Murray's Coming Apart, that you can have meritocracy, or you can have social mobility, but you can't have both.  As the best rise up in society, they mate with others of the best; and the plain laws of genetics then get you a society of hereditary castes, with low social mobility. When doctors married nurses and lawyers married their secretaries, there was some churning. Now doctors marry doctors and lawyers marry lawyers: no more churn.  If this is true, which it looks like it is, it is a fatal truth for the American project. The ethos of this republic is one of both meritocracy \u2014 rewards according to contribution, not to accidents of birth \u2014 and social mobility \u2014 log cabin to White House. If the two things are actually incompatible, as they seem to be, we are in trouble.  All this was foretold sixty years ago by British socialist Michael Young, in his 1958 book The Rise of the Meritocracy. I have commented before, more than once I'm sure, that if you can only read one book about the prospects for modern society, it should be that one.  Michael Young's son Toby Young has carried his Dad's banner forward into our time via articles and talks. He was at it again the other day with a half-hour program on BBC Radio that you can listen to on the internet: google \"BBC Radio 4, The Rise and Fall of the Meritocracy.\"  I urge you to set aside half an hour to listen to Toby Young's program. Next to the need to preserve our national character by immigration restriction, this is the second great issue of our time.  Item: Finally, a sad little story from today's New York Post. Joseph Woznik, 23 years old, of this city, but homeless, has been arrested and accused of burglarizing three Christian churches and a Hindu temple.  Explaining himself, Mr Woznik told police that, quote:  I'm mad at God \u2026 I don't break into houses, only churches. I break in to get back at God.  End quote. Reluctant as I always am to be thought a nitpicker, I feel bound to observe that either Mr Woznik's theology or his grammar is faulty. Hinduism is polytheistic, so he needs to specify which of the many Hindu gods he was taking his vengeance against when he robbed that temple, or at least re-cast his explanation with a plural.  That aside, being angry with the supernatural power or powers is not unusual. I've known several such cases, and literature supplies many others. One of my favorites in the latter category is one of Samuel Beckett's characters who declares, in regard to the Christian God: [Clip: \"The bastard! He doesn't exist.\"]  The sages of antiquity have counseled us against this kind of anger, though. While Mr Woznik awaits his arraignment at Queens County Criminal Court next Wednesday, I urge him to pass the time in self-improvement by studying the works of the philosopher Mencius, where he will find the admonition: \u541b\u5b50\u4e0d\u6028\u5929\u3001\u4e0d\u5c24\u4eba\u3002 \u2014 \"The superior person bears no resentment against Heaven, holds no grudges against his fellow men.\"  09 \u2014 Signoff. That's it, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for listening; and may you, along with Mr Woznik, pass this Easter weekend in solemn reflection.  To help you with that, here's some Wagner: the Pilgrims' Chorus from Tannh\u00e4user. And yes, I know: Wagner would probably have agreed with that Beckett character. Never mind, it's lovely music.  There will be more from Radio Derb next week.  [Music clip: Wagner, The Pilgrims' Chorus from Tannh\u00e4user.",

                              "text": "Are The Polls Rigged Against Trump? All Of These Wildly Divergent Surveys Cannot Possibly Be Correct Michael On Television What Is The Best Place To Live In The United States To Prepare For The Coming Economic Collapse?   May 2nd, 2011 \nWhat is the best place to live in the United States? I get asked that question all the time. My answer can be summed up in two words: it depends. The truth is that the answer is going to be different for each person. All of us have different goals and different needs. If you have a very strong network of family and friends where you live right now, you might want to think twice before moving hundreds or thousands of miles away. If you have a great job where you live right now, you might want to hold on to it. You should not just assume that you are going to be able to pick up and move to another part of the country and be able to get a similar job right away. The United States is in the midst of a very serious economic decline right now, and wherever you live you are going to have to provide for your family. Just because you move somewhere new does not mean that you are going to leave your problems behind. In fact, you might find that they moved right along with you. With all that being said, the reality is that there are some places in the U.S. that are going to be much more desirable than others when the economy totally falls apart. For example, during a total economic collapse it will not be good to be living in a large city or in a densely populated area. Just think about what happened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. If the entire nation is going through something like that, you don\u2019t want to have hundreds of thousands of close neighbors at that point. So when thinking about where you want to be when everything falls apart, population density should be a major factor. But there are other factors as well and no area of the United States is perfect. \nIf you live in or near a major city right now, that is okay. Most Americans do. Even if you have limited financial resources at the moment, you can start developing a plan that will get you where you eventually want to go. If you want to move to another part of the country you can start applying for jobs out there. You can also be working hard to develop a business that would enable you to move. Perhaps you have friends or family in more isolated areas that would allow you to stay with them during an economic collapse. \nThose that possess more financial resources could start thinking about getting a second home in a location that is more rural. \nThe key is to come up with a plan and to be working towards accomplishing that plan. \nIf you don\u2019t have a plan yet, hopefully the following information will give you something to think about. Not all areas of the United States are equal, and all of them do have problems. \nThe following are some thoughts about the best place to live in the United States\u2026. \nThe Northeast \nA major problem with the Northeast is that it is just so darn crowded. Yes, there are some rural areas, but the overall population density of the region is so high that it would be really hard to go unnoticed for long in the event of a major economic collapse. \nAnother thing that is not great about the Northeast is that so much of the population lives near the coast. As we saw in Japan recently, living near a coastline is not necessarily a good thing. While it is likely safer to live along the east coast then the west coast, the truth is that there is an inherent level of insecurity when it comes to living in coastal areas. You never know when the next hurricane, oil spill or tsunami is going to strike. \nAlso, the Northeast is really quite cold. So staying warm and growing your own food would be more difficult than in some other areas of the country. \nThe Mid-Atlantic \nThe Mid-Atlantic is one of the most beautiful areas of the nation. Unfortunately, it suffers from many of the same problems that the Northeast does. \nThe Mid-Atlantic has a very high population density. For example, the area around Washington D.C. is pretty much all suburbs for 50 miles in all directions. \nThe weather is nicer than in the Northeast and there are some less dense areas once you get south of Washington D.C. \nIf you think that the Mid-Atlantic might be for you, you might want to check out North Carolina or South Carolina. The people tend to get friendlier the further south you go and there are definitely some areas that could potentially work. \nFlorida \nFlorida is generally not going to be a place that you want to be during an economic collapse. The housing market has absolutely collapsed down there and the crime rate is already very high. It is also very densely populated. \nThe weather is very nice down in Florida, but one big thing that you need to consider when it comes to Florida is the fact that it is very flat and most of Florida is just barely above sea level. In fact, quite a bit of Florida is actually below sea level. \nIn addition, hurricanes are always a major threat in Florida. It is a beautiful state, but there is a lot of risk to living down there. \nThe Southeast \nThe Southeast has really taken a pounding over the last few years. First it was Hurricane Katrina, and then it was the BP oil spill and then it was the tornadoes of 2011 . \nThere is a lot of poverty in that area of the country. There is also a lot of crime. \nThere are a lot of great people who live down in the Southeast, but if you do not know your way around it can be a very difficult place to move to. \nThe Mid-South \nOne of my favorite places east of the Mississippi River are the mountains along the Tennessee/North Carolina border. If you must be in the eastern half of the United States, that is not a bad choice. \nWhere you do not want to be is anywhere near the New Madrid fault zone . The New Madrid fault zone covers portions of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. The biggest earthquakes in the history of the United States were caused by the New Madrid fault. Many are convinced that we are going to see an absolutely catastrophic earthquake along the New Madrid fault at some point. \nSo if you want to live in the Mid-South, it is highly recommended that you stay far away from the New Madrid fault zone. \nThe Upper Midwest \nThe Upper Midwest was once one of the great manufacturing regions of the world, but now much of it is known as the \u201crust belt\u201d. \nFormerly great manufacturing cities such as Detroit are now absolute hellholes . Tens of thousands of our factories and millions of our jobs have been shipped overseas. \nThere are some really great people (including some good friends of this column) that live up there, but the truth is that the region is really cold and unemployment is rampant. \nThe Upper Midwest is an area that people want to get out of. It is probably not a great place to move to. \nHowever, if you do need a job, one place to look is a little bit west of there. Thanks to an abundance of natural resources, unemployment in North Dakota and South Dakota is very low. If you really need a job you might want to look into those two states. \nThe Southwest \nIn the Southwest there are a whole lot of freedom-loving Americans, the weather is very warm and there is a lot of space to get lost. \nHowever, the Southwest is also very dry and in many areas there is not a lot of water. Drought and wildfires are quite common. \nIn addition, illegal immigration is rampant and is a constant security threat. \nIf you are familiar with that area of the country it is not a bad choice, but if you do not know what you are doing it could end up being disastrous for you. \nThe Great Plains \nAs long as you are far enough away from the New Madrid fault, the Great Plains is not a bad choice. \nIt is very, very flat out there, and it can be quite windy, but the good news is that you should be able to grow your own food. \nIn addition, the population density is generally very low in most areas. \nOne big negative, as we have seen recently, is tornadoes. The United States experiences more tornadoes that anywhere else in the world, and \u201ctornado alley\u201d generally gets the worst of it. \nThe West Coast \nDuring an economic collapse, the West Coast is not a place that you will really want to be. Just take a look at the state of California already. It is an economic nightmare . \nMillions of people have left California over the past couple of decades. The millions of people that have left have been replaced mostly with illegal aliens. \nOregon is better, although they have very high taxes and they are experiencing huge economic problems right now as well. \nThe best area along the West Coast is the Seattle area, but you won\u2019t want to be anywhere near a major population center when things totally fall apart. \nAlso, the West Coast lies along the \u201c Ring of Fire \u201c. Considering what just happened in Japan and what has been happening in other areas along the Ring of Fire lately, the West Coast is not an area that a lot of people are recommending. \nThe Northwest \nLarge numbers of freedom-loving Americans have been moving to the states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. You can also throw eastern Washington and eastern Oregon into this category as well. \nIt gets cold up in the Northwest, but not as cold as the Upper Midwest. There are lots of rivers, streams and lakes and in certain areas there is plenty of rain. \nThe population density is very low in most areas and there is an abundance of wildlife. Housing prices are reasonable and in many areas you can grow your own food. \nThe Northwest is one of the favorite areas of the United States for preppers. It is far from perfect, but it does have a lot of advantages. \nAlaska And Hawaii \nNeither Alaska or Hawaii is recommended. Alaska lies along the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d and it is very, very cold. Also, almost everything has to be either shipped or flown into Alaska. In the event of a real economic collapse, supplies to Alaska could be cut off and shortages could develop very quickly. \nHawaii has a huge population and it does not have a lot of room. Like Alaska, most supplies have to be either shipped in or flown in. And one really bad tsunami could pretty much wipe Hawaii out. \nBut once again, there is no \u201cright answer\u201d. There are areas of just about every U.S. state that could potentially work well during a major economic collapse. \nWhen assessing where \u201cthe best place to live in the United States\u201d is, it is important to examine your own personal factors. What will work for me and for my family will not necessarily work for you and your family. \nSo what do all of you think about this list? Which area of the country do you think is best for those Americans who are seeking to prepare themselves for the coming economic collapse? Scott \nI have actually been thinking about this lately. And population and weather are the two biggest factors. emma \nThis whole Osama dead Stuff really gets to me. \nThe guy from FFT summed it up perfectly. \nhttp://www.forecastfortomorrow.com/news/2011/05/osama-bin-laden-dead/ \nNever before has this country embraced Empire so willingly. Never before have we given up, wholesale, our precious liberties won with the blood of our countrymen. For what?? Some lame ass guy in a cave somewhere that represents some of the best thinking of the 13th Century? This is beyond ridiculous, it is totally absurd. Nickelthrower \nGreetings, \nI can\u2019t help but laugh when I read blogs such as this. I hate to break it to everyone but no place is going to be very safe. Hear me out then see if you don\u2019t agree. \nIf the economic tsunami that is headed our way includes the loss of international oil then it wont matter if you are in New York City or the Deep South. \nWe now know (because we have their documents) what the Soviet Union planned to do to destroy the U.S.A. Whereas we intended to nuke everything and anything in an attempt to kill as many Russians as possible, the Russians believed that they could kill even more Americans by just using a few dozen or so nukes on a few of our ports and all of our major oil refineries. \nWhere we planned to annihilate everyone in every major city in the Soviet Union, they figured that they could kill even more Americans by just shutting off the oil. They knew that the loss of oil would cause pandemonium in the U.S.A and that the starving people would spill out of the cities and eat up everything until there was nothing left and no means to grow or obtain any more. \nLet me reiterate it again for you just to make sure you got it: The loss of oil brought about by the collapse of the dollar will be more devastating than a nuclear holocaust. \nWhatever little \u201cAlamo\u201d you set up for yourself in Hillbilly Land wont be so much as a speed bump when thousands of hungry people descend upon it. \nDo a little research and read about what a famine of biblical proportions looks because that is what will go down when the pumps go dry. shawn \nThat was pretty interesting and it make since. It actually just reinforces the conclusion I have drawn. N. Dakota is the place I think I am gonna move my family to as soon as I can.Its gonna take people a while to run outta the major cities into n. Dakota as there are no major cities close in any direction.This would give N. Dakota plenty of time to prepare. N. Dakota has it\u2019s own state bank.It also has nuclear war heads stationed there and if the people and local authorities could seize control of them it would go a long way in defending itself from a tyrannical federal government. It has an abundance of oil and agriculture. Also, it is the state that could most easily succeed from the union (even more likely than Texas) as technically it never really was properly admitted into the union. It is cold and flat but that has kept the wrong kind of people away. N. Dakota also has 0 debt and did not take federal bail out money so they have the right mentality and they already want to succeed. Missy \nThat was an excellent article Michael!! You are such an excellent writer. I am really looking forward to the comments that will be left on this article. The middle of the US is certainly one of the safer places to live. VegasBob \nThe Central and Eastern areas of Washington State are actually a fairly nice place to be. The people are generally friendly, and they are far less judgmental than Southerners (I am a native Southerner, so I know just how judgmental Southerners can be). The trouble is that there is not a lot of cultural stuff going on \u2013 symphonies, museums, theatres, etc. Maria \nWe have lived in many different states over the last 25 years from Alaska and Hawaii in the west to Virginia in the east and Texas in the south. We are convinced you are right\u2026there is no perfect place. People need to decide which drawbacks they are most capable of dealing with (snow, rain, heat, earthquakes, etc) and plan accordingly. \nIf it gets much worse economically, one thing will be certain\u2026if you can\u2019t protect what you have, then you won\u2019t have it for very long. \nI pray it doesn\u2019t get that bad. Pat \nI live in Alaska and just got back from vacationing down south. Alaska may be cold and hostile, but one thing it has going for it is stability \u2013 something I\u2019ve noticed the lower 48 has been lacking lately. If you know how to live in cold-weather environments, Alaska ain\u2019t a bad choice. Gutter Economist \nPeople need to start thinking about what comes after the economic collapse. I would look for states that are rich in natural resources and away from coastal areas. \nIf we have a civil war, I would like to see the following states pull out the union and become the Mountain States of America. With respect to natural resources, these states might include Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. If residents of these states were smart, they would pull out of the union ASAP. Hognutz \nI\u2019m staying right here on my farm in good old S.C. \nOne thing not mentioned is family support and real friends. If you have them you might be better off with them\u2026.. karl \nYellowstone Patty \nMy husband and I saw this coming over 12 years ago as we were living in Florida. With crime, drugs and homeless people all around us. We looked at Tennessee but it just wasn\u2019t right for us. We ended up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I notice more than not that when people think of Michigan they ALWAYS think Detroit. Evidenced once again in your article. The UP is the land of God so to speak with great natural resources, good and plentiful water and lots and lots of land. The people up here are resourceful and know how to live off the land. Yes it\u2019s cold and I like it that way because it discourages the type of people that all southern and warm states have too many of\u2026\u2026\u2026. shawn \namen J \nIf you are willing to work abroad there are many countries where you can teach English. Just get the CELTA. It\u2019s a four week English teaching certificate. Here are a few sites that list ESL teaching jobs abroad: \nhttp://www.teachaway.com \nI am a U.S. citizen and I am currently teaching physics in Saudi Arabia with a lot of expats from all over the west. Many teachers here have purchased property abroad since the cost of living is cheaper like Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. \nPlease go to http://www.trulia.com because you will find many inexpensive property listings all over the U.S. there. There are some great property listings in the Portland, Oregon area. \nI hope this helps. Owen \nLike the old gospel song proclaims \u201cThere\u2019s no hiding place down here.\u201d Your preparatins will be in vain if you disregard this truth. The time is short aa it appears to this reader that we have now entered the beginning of sorrows. Just Me \nother than the northwest, I\u2019ll still stick with Pa or Central NY, it gets a little cold and there is some snow, but we don\u2019t have to worry about forest fires, earth quakes,floods, tornadoes,hurricanes,Tsunamies,mud slides,poison snakes,scorpions,alligators,fresh water,very few draughts,burning heat waves,high moisture. and there won\u2019t be very many roving bandits from Sept til June. Wood Burner \nMost people who live on the Great Plains have only seen a tornado on the weather channel. The damage done by twisters is very localized and narrow. Most assuredly not a factor in determining whether to locate there or not. \nAlso, using possibles like the New Madrid fault as a factor in where to locate is like using the possibility of zombie rabbits popping up. There is just no certainty of any event like a huge earthquake occurring in the center of the U.S. Mathematically it can not even be an issue. \nWhat can be stated with certainty is the fact that when the SHTF you will not want to be in or near a large city of any kind. There the possibility of encountering zombie criminals of the human type is not only high but virtually assured. One can make preparations but how does one keep the provisions from being taken by starving idiots? You can try to defend your position but the numbers are against you. \nUltimately there is only one way anybody gets out of this life with a chance of redemption. Use it. Rev 6:5 \nI think the best place to go in the event of a economic collapse or something much worse would be out in Utah. Most of Utah is isolated except around Salt Lake City. The weather isnt that bad in winter but summers can get hot in the southern half of the state. I would definetly recommend living near a water source such as a lake or river. There are places around Fruita, UT that grow crops out in the middle of the desert because of the Freemont River. Living in the mountains would be fine in the summer but they can recieve a lot of snow and cold from October to May. Utah just seems to me to be the most practical location. Matt \nIt must be warm year round. Southwest wins here. Summer heat is very uncomfortable but extreme cold is much worse if you cannot afford the high cost of heating or cooling your home. J \nAnother good thing about living and teaching abroad is that you don\u2019t have to pay taxes. Just file the 2555-EZ form. jet \nI would pass on Oregon and Washington. The taxes are incredibly high, there is always the threat of tsunami or earthquake and it rains or is cloudy for about nine months a year, people are in a constant state of depression because of the weather. Oh, and it is liberal in the extreme. People here don\u2019t like \u201cfreedom loving Americans\u201d, aka conservatives. Freedom Lover \nMontana, Idaho and Wyoming depends if you are in one of the wolf high population areas you could not pick a worst area. Wildlife is being slaughtered off in record numbers. Ranchers forced out of business that milk cow and chickens for survival would be close to impossible to raise. Now the wolves are spreading disease to the animals and people. Before you even think of moving to one of these 3 States you should watch Yellowstone is Dead. \nWhere ever you pick make sure you have your own well water is going to be very important and you truly can\u2019t store enough water. Massivecarbunkle \nEveryone must find a place, surely most will want to be near blood relatives, those who grew up in the 80\u2019s when the media taught them to be independent and far from home, they will find it very hard, very, very, hard indeed. Most strangers in places they are not familiar with during the economic collapse will be dissed and treated very harsh and left for dead by city dwellers. For this was the GREAT SIN of the citizens of Sodom and Gomorrah, the wicked and cruel treatment of strangers. jose puta \nthe best place for you to live is on the Amazon with the tribes, quit spreading your disease. JH \nThere are some great areas in California along the Sierra Mountain range and in Northern California. They are warm most the year, have very fertile soil for gardening, low population density, natural beauty and water sources (off the mountains). Yes, taxes and property rates are high and employment is tough, but if you can work from home or are retired, not a bad option. \nSouthern Colorado in the Rockies is another good option with limited government, cheap land, low population density, water sources, few gun laws, etc. It gets cold, but not as cold as other places. Judith \nYou are forgetting the Yellowstone volcano. That should pretty much take care of the Northwest. Adrian \nI noticed lately that more Americans are moving to Australia. We have plenty of rooms and we love Americans. So come on over. Gary2 \nWe have a large body of fresh water on our door step. Lake MI looks as big as any ocean from the shore line. Please keep telling people to not move here (WI) as I hate crowds and a lot of people clogging up everything. The cold keeps the nasty bugs at bay. If you need a well you can pretty much sink a hole anywhere and get wonderful water. With water shortages we are positioned quite well. Steve \nEconomic collapse? Do you really know how the collapse will happen? How about a Mexico border state like TX, NM or AZ. Start a garden. In a rural area a little south of a big city. Learn spanish and have a little vacation home in Mexico to escape to with a Peso bank account. Keep your van packed ready to run. Would love to have a little Wine and Coffee plantation near the Mexican town of Chicxulub in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula run by a bunch of nice se\u00f1oritas. InArizona \nI think you are wrong about Alaska, there are many places in Alaska that are WARMER than the Northwest in the Winter. Anywhere along the water is more temperate than the Northern part of the Cont US. Also, Alaska has abundant LARGE game, fish, and other resources that no other state does. Forget about shipments up there, what would you need? Lumber is available, oil, and nat gas are everywhere\u2026 Not to mention\u2026 the VERY long growing days in the summer produce some of the largest fruits and vegatables\u2026. just take a look at the Palmer Fair each fall\u2026 Also, tidal waves, volcanos are an issue as well as earthquakes, but just living away from low lying coastal areas would mitigate that threat. One thing about Alaska\u2026 you NEVER have to worry about a drought! So summertime will produce plenty of vegatables\u2026 wheat and grains don\u2019t work so well, but I have been successful growing corn, risky and a lot of work, but it can be done. \nI think that as a human being you would find most of the resources you need up there, without the competition for resources, which needs to be taken into consideration. \nSo, my short answer, it depends on how BAD it gets, Alaska would be perfect WTSHTF! InArizona \njust so you know, I currently live in Arizona, and am originally from Alaska\u2026 born and raised, been in AZ for 10 years now. \nI can see advantages to both places to live, but I really worry about water here, and the availability of game animals. I am also out of my element, so when I go into survival mode, I am thinking about Alaska. \nHere in the desert all we have is bunnies and cacti\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to build a home from cacti, and eating those darn bunnies would eventually get very old! (I currently have moose meat and smoked salmon in my freezer\u2026you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can\u2019t take the trailer park out of the girl!) tobage \nRural Southwestern Michigan \nThe Great Lakes area is the Saudi Arabia of freshwater in general, but SW Mich has some of the most fertile land on Earth\u2026AND a 180 day growing season\u2026that will only be getting longer thanks to abrupt climate shift. \nExtremely few places on planet Earth have this. \nAnd THIS\u2026\u2026 is all that will matter. \nI bet thats why you are sterring people away. wink wink\u2026 foldenfan \nWe are in west central Minnesota, and feel pretty good about our area. Yes, it has cold winters (though the summers are the best I have ever seen), but as has been said about the cold winters, \u201cIt helps keep the riff-raff out.\u201d We have lived in Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and have a lot of experience with Wyoming and Montana. We feel this is the safest place for us. \nGardening for food here is great, good soil, adequate rain, growing season is such that if we can\u2019t grow it, we don\u2019t need it. Lots of cattle (dairy & beef) in our area, low population, and the people are of the best overall quality we have seen anywhere. Main farm crops here are corn, wheat, oats, hay, barley,soybeans, potatoes, flax, sugar beets, etc. \nAverage folks here are conservative (most of the Libs are in the cities), and well armed. As for wildlife, we have lots of deer, turkey, pheasant are making a comeback, and thousands of lakes for fishing. Also have some wolves, coyotes, and a few bear around. \nWe feel that when Teotwaki hits we will have as good a chance here as anywhere. \nLand is relatively inexpensive compared to most regions that have \u201cusable\u201d land. We have 80 acres, 50 in Oak trees (LOT\u2019s of excellent firewood), and 30 open for gardens and fields. I will admit that land is more expensive now than when we bought back in 1997. Overall, we\u2019ve been here 20+ years so we have considerable experience in this area. Gist of my comment is, don\u2019t sell parts of MN and the eastern Dakotas short. Marlene Spence \nSan Juan Capistrano California is beautiful. We grow vegetables, etc. and have survival food purchased from Jim Bakker Ministries. We do have a nuclear plant near by, however. I think Nuclear Plants need to be considered. JD \nThank you Michael. I still know Montana is far perfect but when the weather is nice like it is today this truly is the last best place. Except for Yellowstone. But you cant think that its going to blow up everyday it would make you insane. Michael \nWhen Yellowstone goes, it will generally be better to be north and west of it rather than east and south of it. JD \nOh some good news I might be able to get my old job back after getting laid off two years ago. I would be happier than i have been in a long time. I pray and i believe it will happen. Everyone reading this blog there is hope out there. Im glad its here for all of us to share our thoughts. Home is what you make of it. Like Michael was saying about using your family and connections where you live is important. It may be your only hope. I grateful even tho im techincally homeless and my friend lets me use his computer the weather is getting nicer Bin Laden is dead today is awesome. I love MT & i totally agree with gutter econonmist that Rocky Mt States of America will happen. Eastern OR & Spokane could join just as long as not too many hippies invade here. Ooops I guess theres Missoula too late.. morpheus \nI know it seems like our only choice is to retreat and run for the hills. Big mistake! Because soon everyone will follow. No, we have to stand and fight or we will lose everything if we run like cowards. \nWake up America. It\u2019s time\u2026 \n\u201cTHE REVOLUTION HAS STARTED\u201d Read \u201cCommon Sense 3.1\u201d at ( http://www.revolution2.osixs.org ) \nFIGHT THE CAUSE \u2013 NOT THE SYMPTOM\u201cSpread the News\u201d jpalm \nNice site, but it lost me where it says: \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing it said that democracy doesn\u2019t work. Of course it doesn\u2019t work. We are supposed to work it.\u201d\u2013 Alexander Woollcott \nOur country is not a Democracy. The thought that it is a Democracy has led us to the situation we\u2019re in today. Our country is a Republic. Period. Not a Democracy, not a Democratic Republic. A Republic, a form of government where 99% can\u2019t vote away the rights of 1%. Kevin \nRegardless if there is a collapse or not it would be wise to live where there would be jobs in gainful private sector employment. Those states with significant shale natural gas deposits and farming would be the best bet. Even if your not directly working in either field there are support jobs that come along for the ride. Small town western Pennsylvania may be a choice. Pennsylvania is Philadelphia and Pittsburg with West Virginia in the middle. Once out of the damn few cities the place is Maybury RFD. Thinkaboutit \nGlad you recommended against Hawaii, because there are plenty of people there\u2026but Tsunami only affects the coast\u2026there are great higher elevation places to live in Hawaii where the food falls out of trees along with fresh rainwater nearly every night ryan \ni live in rural western wa and its not as liberal as one would think.most all libs live in seattle and the other bigger citys on the coast but every where out side of that is good old americans!everybody i no are gun owners on a large scale to say in the long run that we will be overrun by starving people after the callapse is nonsense we will fort up and protect ourselves and are familys and friends!besides most will be killed by mobbs or will starve before they can even try to get out of the city. people underestimate us country folk! smarter than you \nEureka, California is the best place you can possibly live. Don\u2019t argue with me. Just get your ass to Eureka. Thomas \nHawaii seems a good choice. Plenty of military around to help keep order and a preferred place for Asian visitors. Even as everything has to be flown or shipped in, the state is small and can be managed easier than larger states. Old Red (neck) \nPick Colorado or Utah, or maybe western Nebraska. Don\u2019t come to Idaho, nothing but gun tote\u2019n, beer swillin\u2019, bible thumpin\u2019 rednecks with old cars and furniture in the yard. Stay away! You\u2019ll be bored too. Don\u2019t come here! 38Blackfin \nFull disclosure: I am writing from the Southeast- \nThe comments written here about the Southeast could only have been from someone with zero first-hand knowledge of the area. I don\u2019t even know where to start\u2026 Twiinkles \nAfter reading this seems like there some good alternatives outside the USA . Obamistake \nDoesn\u2019t matter where I live\u2026I\u2019ve exercised my Second Amendment rights several times over. With my food supply I\u2019ll be just fine. mtguy \nSounds like great ideas, but also like we need some geography lessons. I\u2019m in E. Washington/N. Idaho area. It is the west side of the state that has most of the population (think Seattle) and the rain. East of the Cascades is much better for the things we\u2019re talking about -plenty of water, decent growing season, lots of wildlife (animals not bars)and fishing. Yes there\u2019s snow, but that clears out the \u201csnow birds\u201d who won\u2019t make it anyway in a big catastrophe. It also makes for a lot of fun during the winter months with skiing, snowshoeing, etc. Good luck everybody. DJ \nI live in Alaska. Moved heree from Kentucky because of all the people. I have acclimated to the environment now. Coal is on top of the ground in places and trees are abundant, I have a wood/coal burning stove in my log home. Its warm, I am oof the grind and I live at least 100 miles from the nearest population base of any size. \nHeirloom seeds, my own well, two years of dehydrated food and I am a fire arms instructor with lots of instructional equipment\u2026. Just like home. And if I am a Hillbilly then so be it. I will make it. Rod \nNot mentioned but should be considered is proximity to nuclear power plants. I wouldn\u2019t want to be within 50 miles downwind from one. Another good point about a northern climate is food storage is easier and pests can be less bothersome than a southern climate. Ben Dover \nI read the article with an open mind and came away with the thought that the author is of the opinion that all 300 million of us are doomed and should just eat a bullet\u2026it\u2019s why i do not often read this stuff\u2026common sense, it ain\u2019t common\u2026 mondobeyondo \nBut be warned, stock up on potatoes. Potatoes don\u2019t grow well out here in the desert. Don J \nRight. No perfect place, but I feel that where we live (East Texas) is perfect for us, primarily because my brothers and I inherited over 1,000 acres. We have lakes with fish, tillable garden/crop areas including areas close to our water wells, there are wild hogs that populate the area that are delicious and deer. We can butcher our own meat and cook it over hardwood fires, in an oven or deep fried. We can raise just about any vegetable and most fruit. We know how to prepare and can veggies and fruit. Not too sure how to can meat, but I feel that we could always have fresh meat either with fish, wild hog, or venison in season. There\u2019s no closed season on hogs. We have generators to keep our freezers going and house powered. We have diesel and gasoline stored in overhead tanks. We have guns and bullets and the ability to reload hunting and handgun rounds. Have we thought of everything? Probably not, but if we have to, we think we could survive some very hard times, if it comes to pass. I wish everyone the best. DJ Tom Hallett \nWhile the mid-atlantic does indeed have its share of exposed coastline, you failed to mention the very rural Susquehanna basin. \nFrom southeastern Pennsylvania to northeastern Maryland, the Susquehanna basin is quite rural, lush, and teeming with food on hoof and fin. \nThanks for keeping our little secret! Big Dave \nI live in Central Texas which is greener than most people think. Water has always been a concern, but now that I am collecting thousands of gallons off my roof I don\u2019t worry about it. Nothing tastes better. The freedoms we have in Texas are great and I know because I grew up in California. The economy is better here and though we do have money shortfalls we are not bankrupt. Yes it\u2019s hot, but I\u2019d rather have heat than extreme cold. God bless Texas! kebozarth \nThank you for your heads-up. DownWithLibs \n@ Vegas Bob: \nTY! Yes, we haven\u2019t quite caught the horrible, sad mental illness known as \u201cLiberalism\u201d. Our strong-rooted Conservatism genes seem to be fending it off quite well. Although I do fear the day that our defenses get weakened. DownWithLibs \n@ Gary2: \nI see when it comes to \u201cspreading the wealth\u201d in the property department, you suddenly don\u2019t feel like sharing. (I believe the word we are after here is Hypocrite!) Richard \nYou really need to leave the United States altogether and choose a country that is not about to be subjected to the horrors of a gut-wrenching depression. Asia is the obvious choice. They will suffer from the coming bust as well but thereafter they will pick themselves up, dust themselves off, bounce back and go from strength to strength. The Asians do not carry the crushing debts that will hobble the United States and Europe for generations to come. If you\u2019re looking for a country where they speak English, Malaysia\u2019s your answer. Ted \nNW NJ is overlooked. Much has been done to preserve the truly pristene waters and farmlands of this area. Please do not judge what you have not tasted.It is still known as the Garden State.Quality of life will continue to be good because the people have a spirit of survival and work ethhic.A challenge here is an everyday occurance. If you can make it here you can make it anywhere. Home is where you make it. What are you running from? Okie Dan \nIt is extremely difficult to predict what the fallout would be with an economic collapse. Will martial law take place? Will redistribution of wealth occur? Will military forces simply be used to round up unemployed masses especially in the city? Will the economic collapse have only marginally increased changes than the present situation? There can be no certainty in planning for the scenario. Obviously networks matter. I imagine Oklahoma to be for most people better than Illinois in such a scenario. But I have a sister and brother-in-law,and nephews in Illinois with a spacious house and they farm. I could move there, while in Oklahoma without a job, my network would likely not be nearly so solid nor certain. Lots to think about. metalurgy \nWelp, glad you are discouraging the Midwest. That is where I live. In MN. Happy to see the riff raff leave and move south to warmer climates. \nI know how to and have backpacked and camped in 80 below windchill in the middle of winter mutiple times in my life and was extremely warm and comfortable. \nEasy if you know how to live in this type of environment. \nThere is a ton of food to eat, even in the winter time. I don\u2019t need a job and I don\u2019t need uncle Sam to survive. \nNot for everybody here in freezing MN but then I like it that way. Doc Loch \nMontana is great. Been here all my 45 yrs. (Except short jaunts of a few years to Germany and Oregon). You are all welcome here, and the beauty is unsurpassed, but don\u2019t forget that if you can\u2019t handle 45 degrees BELOW zero for 2 to 4 weeks at a time and lots of snow, then you can\u2019t wear the badge! Bob \nMichael, \nThe safest place to be if Yellowstone goes, I\u2019m sorry to say, is Yellowstone. I would not want to be alive if and when it does go as the Earth will be nearly uninhabitable. \nBob Jack \nLindsey Williams did a good recent film of the elite\u2019s timeline for the destruction of the dollar, etc. \nThe main thing is be around family to pool resources, protect one another and be away from big cities. \nAlso, stock up now\u2026.and make sure your spiritual house is in order. Mcbain \nThe Northeast: NY City, Boston, etc\u2026..sure crowded, but has anyone driven straight across Vermont, NH, Maine lately? Crowded it is not! JD \nGood point about the hogs in the south. They are large in number and probably tasty. I mean where else can you find free bacon? Sabonim \nI live in a very rural area of Central Florida about 2 hours north from Tampa and Orlando. I have 1/2 acre over a great aquifer of fresh water with a 6 foot stockade fence, chickens, fruit trees and a garden. I am very well armed, have a Black Belt, am stocked with food, ammo and real money (not paper)and NO debt. I have a good fishing boat and a motorcycle (55 mpg) and am 45 minutes from the nearest coast and 300 yards to woods (a forest) and a huge fresh water spring fed river. I like Florida and where I am at for what is coming. BTW \u2026 I am 53 years old and lived hear all my life and have only had one hurricane hit this area, and other than a big mess and no elec. for a few days \u2026 no damage done. Good luck to you all. Paschall \nNickelthrower\u2019s argument is far more cogent than anything else I read here. Bunkers, stockpiles, gardens, and guns will not ease the terror and pandemonium. \u201cHide in a hole if you wish, but you won\u2019t live one instant longer. Fear profits man nothing.\u201d HT Liu \nDon\u2019t escape. Try not to allow the economic disaster to happen. Vote with your head but not your feet. Stop voting for immoral politicians who continue irresponsible wild spending, uncontrolled growth of debt, and irrational increases of taxes. The best solution is to never, never, never re-elected anyone. Check what politicians do but don\u2019t listen to what they have to say. If you can\u2019t do that, you deserve a disaster. Mark C \nOriginally from Texas but I\u2019m already on our family farm here in the Philippines. Better get busy folks, there\u2019s not much time left. Texas Tea \nBefore BO was elected I mentioned to a friend that I was considering moving back to Texas. She said I should do it soon, so I wouldn\u2019t have to go through Customs! Well, I moved and I\u2019m happy to say we\u2019re still a part of the good old USA. We\u2019re just different enough, however, that if the SHTF we would lock those borders down, become the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy, and feast on our oil, coal, forests, lakes, rivers, farms, wildlife, and football. Dang! Is Texas great or what? Rooster \nAre you kidding me\u2026.You can fivd problems in all areas of the U.S. Finding a place to go\u2026Now\u2026.it\u2019s way too late to think of relocating\u2026hunker down and prepare wherever you are; the finacial outlay for any move would better be used to have supplies. yes it is best to be out of a major populated area. Don\u2019t worry about the new madrid, worry about supplies like tolet paper\u2026.. Ben rhea \nThere is no place that you can consider best when economic collapse is already here. Doomsday scenarios rarely ever come true. I think this will iron out, but houses are not going to get really cheap any time soon if at all, and currency war still boiling, plus the riots in Middle East which has an indirect effect to all and natural calamities all over the world. I understand that our country is completely out of control. One would have to wonder if the truth even exists for people, much less corporations. The U.S.\u2019s unemployment stats are more manipulated, kneaded & massaged than the thighs on a world-class ballerina. \nHate applying to jobs? Let us do it for you. Human job search assistant \u2013 http://www.jobwaltz.com \nNorth Central and North West U.S. are good bets. They have tough cold seasons, but that will drive away those with not so good work ethics. \nPart of Americas problem is too many living off of those who are working. \nSouth California will be a lost cause as Mexico tries to take over. Texas on the other hand is not going to be very forgiving to those who have raped our system for years. I have worked with plenty of decent hard working Hispanics. But a good chunk of them don\u2019t care for America or the Gringos. \nNorth East will be bad when all the spent rod ponds at the nuke plants start going dry and you have radiation clouds down wind from them. \nThe coasts offer fish and water. It will be hard to over fish the oceans. You can also desalinate enough water to survive, especially if you have a hot day. Hurricanes can be prepared for, tsunamis, not so. So the East coast might be the better choice, unless you have a little elevation. There is historical evidence of major Tsunamis in Oregon AND SoCal in the last few hundred years.. \nLast bit of advice. If you have an acre or more, you absolutely should have a way to store 3 K gallons of water. No excuse if you have the rain. I hate seeing all that fresh water go down the ditch to the creek. \nSierra Dave coal \nWhat about being mobile with a camper of some sort. You would have to have access to a good supply of fuel? At any rate, too many variables to consider a place of safety. What looks good today could very well be the worst place to go after some event takes place. Being mobile, a better chance of being able to move swiftly as the situation dictates?? Hal \nGloom & Doom. Looks like we are in for some really bad times. Or not! USA has been through tough times before and bounced back every time. I don\u2019t expect this to be any different, but it may take a little longer. It would probably help if all you pessimists and doomsayers(cons or lib) would quit whining and speculating and get of your dead asses to do something positive for a change. OK, off the soapbox\u2026where to live\u2026.anywhere your heart desires No rules, but..buy property, preferably rural(at least one acre), if you can. If you can\u2019t afford or borrow, work, work , work till you have the means. Improve your credit and use it only for buying property(not for toys). Learn cycles\u2026do not buy during highs in the area. Do this and you will all at least survive any downturn and be better off than I am(retired, living in FL in an average house, on a small lot, close to the beach, but running out of money). Complaining? Nah. I have lived in many areas of the USA and UK and loved every minute. Endured tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and burglaries, all part of life. GET OVER IT!! Live your life!! Use good old American know how and innovation. Chris \nIf you agree with the premise that America is going to suddenly turn into Afghanistan over night then perhaps the rural/survivalist move is the way to go. If you believe that the descent will occur over 10-20 years you want to be urban. You want to be able to walk/bike to wherever you need. You need access to public transportation. You need access to jobs. Yes, there will still be jobs in the US and jobs equals money. We won\u2019t be bartering chickens for healthcare any time soon. You need public services such as fire and police as it is unlikely the suburbs will be supported by services or infrastructure improvements. Any further than the near suburbs will be completely out of the question for any support system whatsoever. Those areas will be sacrificed to the budgetary gods. Let\u2019s be honest, very very very few people are going to be capable of being self sufficient. \nObviously, most of the commenters think they they are the second coming of Grizzly Adams. Good for them. And good luck. You will need it. For the other 298 million of us, being close to the core and the support of friends and neighbors very close by is the best place to be for at least the next decade +. Larry Calhoun \nAt this time being very disabled I\u2019m living with family just East of Houston, TX. I WANT to move out of this present Hurricane endangered area & somewhere between Austin & Dallas. (Preferably in a high elevation area where a nice underground home can be built, and be protected from floods or tornados.) One great thing about living in \u2018the Republic of Texas\u2019s is that this State has reserved the right to secede from the USA ***if*** necessary. Also; establishing a residence that\u2019s not on the grid has its own unique appeal\u2026..doesn\u2019t it? Fed Up \n(Opps, I put this in the wrong article, belongs here) \nWe are planning on moving to Colorado. As \u201cJD\u201d said in another discussion, \u201cthe Rockies are the last best place.\u201d \nColorado already has lots of preppers, organized in various areas and they meetup as a group a few times a year. CO has low taxes, hardly any gun laws, and a history of independent thinking and self-reliance. If you live at lower elevations the weather is perfect four seasons, with LOTS of sunshine, no natural disasters (except forest fires), and NO BUGS. Water can be an issue, but there are lots of creeks, rivers, and good wells if you look for them. \nThere\u2019s plenty of wildlife, fishing, and firewood.

Quite and remote and plenty of resourses. Dee \nYou never mentioned Colorado? We have fresh mountain streams,plenty of game and not too many overcrowded areas. Plus, a large number of people who know how to survive off of the land and who are already starting to band together and plan\u2026 \nOur Gourmet Survival Food Business Opportunity \nThe best place to live is in Santa Cruz California. We\u2019re above any Tsunami levels. Earthquakes are fun here and have never killed anyone. The University of California provides much cultural things to do. The weather is PERFECT year-round and the population low. The Beaches are beautiful, AND you can get everything you need, including our Survival Food. No big cities even close. Xploregon \nIn 2-3 months I\u2019ll have two (2) two (2) acre remote wooded lots available for sale in south/central Oregon (Coos County)for sale (price not yet determined) on a very large fresh water lake about three (3) miles inland from the beach. Currently lake/water access only but may have seasonal road which can be developed to year round if desired. 30+ miles of nothing but deep Pacific NW forest (mostly state forest land)to the East and simular S, N & West. Sportsmans paradise in the \u201cbananna belt\u201d of Oregon. Septic and water well approvable. Badguy \nYes, the Midwest is a rust belt\u2026 but that may be an advantage! We\u2019re ALREADY poor.. so any hard economic times will only be \u201cmore of the same\u201d. Also, there\u2019s plenty of fresh water, woods and ground that can be cultivated easily. Also, it\u2019s hard to hold riots when the temperature is 20 degress F or below (5 months a year). Also, if an when, the government decides that bringing back manufacturing is a must if a military confrontation with China becomes eminent or to avoid a complete social and political collapse, we still have trained workers the can restart the process. Liz Michael \nIn the event of a collapse, you probably want to pick a place or a region which could survive on its own as an independent republic. To me, this means Texas, and any state relatively close to Texas. I am in Arizona, close enough to Texas. In a collapse, illegal immigration may no longer be a problem: no jobs means no immigrants. Phenius Barnham \nKetchum, Idaho. The rest of Idaho is not all that you\u2019d want. The Ski Folk come and spread smiles. Scott and Smith are headquartered here. The Sawtooth Mountains are some of the prettiest in the world and the populace are friendly and educated. Mountains are always the last to attract military. Yellowstone is not going to go off so relax. The homes are all well built and there ain\u2019t no junk. Crime is non-existant because most people have their own money and the poor always have jobs. MICHAELD \nNorthern and North Central Idaho has the advantages of rural life but access to several larger communities in Oregon and Washington, just across the Idaho border in the Panhandle. The Lewiston/Clarkston area at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers has a great climate (much warmer than the surrounding higher elevations) and access to any outdoor recreation you can think of. Coeur d\u2019Alene and Post Falls are very close to Spokane. All have great medical facilities. \nJobs are tough to come by, but self employment is a great option for anyone handy with tools. Lots of retired folk live here and they generally have resources to hire things done for them. Acreages are still cheap, too. BMOC \nI live on South Beach. I can eat pole dancers and foreign tourists. And their children. My tinfoil hat will keep me from sunburn. I live near a pharmacy to supply me my Prozac. In case of riots I can club people on their heads with a Cuban sandwich to defend myself. If things get too bad here I can grab onto an old tire and float myself over to the Bahamas.

March 14th, 2016 \nIf Americans are so happy, then why do we consume 80 percent of the entire global supply of prescription painkillers? Less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population lives in this country, and yet we buy four-fifths of these highly addictive drugs. In the United States today, approximately 4.7 million Americans are addicted to prescription pain relievers, and that represents about a 300 percent increase since 1999. If you personally know someone that is suffering from this addiction, then you probably already know how immensely destructive these drugs can be. Someone that was formally living a very healthy and normal life can be reduced to a total basket case within a matter of weeks. \nAnd of course many don\u2019t make it back at all. According to the CDC, more than 28,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2014. Incredibly, those deaths represented 60 percent of all drug overdose deaths in the United States for that year \u2026 \nA report released by the US Centers for Disesase Control and Prevention (CDC) in January revealed that drug-overdose deaths reached a new high in 2014, totaling 47,055 people. Opioids, a type of powerful painkiller that requires a prescription, were involved in 60% of those deaths . \nMany Americans that start out on legal opioids quickly find themselves moving over to heroin because it is often cheaper and easier to obtain, and the U.S. is now facing a tremendous epidemic of heroin abuse as well. In fact, the number of Americans that die of a heroin overdose nearly quadrupled between 2000 to 2013. \nFinally, the federal government has started to take notice of this crisis. A bill was recently passed to spend more than a billion dollars over the next two year fighting this problem. \nBut as long as doctors are writing thousands upon thousands of new prescriptions for these painkillers each year, this crisis is not going to go away any time soon. \nIn the Appalachians, these prescription painkillers are commonly known as \u201c hillbilly heroin \u201c, and all of the attention that the New Hampshire primaries received focused a lot of attention on how this crisis is destroying countless numbers of lives up in the Northeast. But one survey found that the states with the biggest problems with painkiller addiction are actually in the West \u2026 \nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a survey of approximately 67,500 people across the United States, found that the states with the highest rates of narcotic painkiller abuse were in the West \u2013 Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington. \nUnless you are about to die, I would very strongly recommend that you resist any attempt by your doctor to put you on these \u201cmedications\u201d. Just consider what happened to one stay-at-home mother named Norah Mangan \u2026 \nI am an educated, suburban wife and stay-at-home mother of four. Life had been good to me until a fateful visit with an orthopedic physician, my chief complaint being mild arthritic pain in my toes. My physician handed me the first of many monthly prescriptions for Oxycodone and what followed that appointment was a rapid descent into hell. Within six months, I had become a raving drug addict . \nBefore too long, Norah had to turn to means that were less than legal in order to keep fueling her addiction. Her life was turned into a complete and utter disaster by drugs that were legally prescribed to her\u2026 \nIt wasn\u2019t long before my legal monthly prescription fell woefully short in terms of keeping my life altering pain at bay. In the interest of not incriminating myself, I\u2019ll simply share that when procured through other means, Oxycodone generally sells for one dollar per milligram. I was draining our savings and was out of my mind. I was so tortured that I didn\u2019t care about the deterioration of my moral values, in fact, I didn\u2019t even notice. It\u2019s hard to imagine that in such a short period of time I had morphed from a Mrs. Cleaver, baking hot cinnamon buns in anticipation of my children\u2019s arrival home from school, to Scarface crushing pills on the glass top of the executive desk in our home office while thinking to myself as I heard them arrive from school\u2026why oh why are they home already? \nYou can read the rest of her amazing story right here \u2026 \nThe truth is that we are the most drugged people on the face of the planet. It has been estimated that 52 million Americans over the age of 12 have used prescription drugs in non-medical ways, and this problem gets worse with each passing year. \nAccording to research that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 59 percent of all U.S. adults are currently on at least one prescription drug , and 15 percent of all U.S. adults are on at least five prescription drugs . And the numbers are far worse for older Americans. The following statistics come from one of my previous articles \u2026 \n\u2013 According to the CDC, approximately 9 out of every 10 Americans that are at least 60 years old say that they have taken at least one prescription drug within the last month. \n\u2013 There is an unintentional drug overdose death in the United States every 19 minutes . \n\u2013 In the United States today, prescription painkillers kill more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined . \n\u2013 According to the CDC, approximately three quarters of a million people a year are rushed to emergency rooms in the United States because of adverse reactions to pharmaceutical drugs. \n\u2013 The percentage of women taking antidepressants in America is higher than in any other country in the world. \n\u2013 Children in the United States are three times more likely to be prescribed antidepressants as children in Europe are. \n\u2013 A shocking Government Accountability Office report discovered that approximately one-third of all foster children in the United States are on at least one psychiatric drug. \n\u2013 A survey conducted for the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that more than 15 percent of all U.S. high school seniors abuse prescription drugs. \nWe are a deeply unhappy nation that has been trained to turn to pills as a \u201cquick fix\u201d for our hurt and our pain. \nYes, there are medical situations that call for prescription pain relievers. But what we are seeing in America today goes far, far beyond that. We are a nation of addicts that is always in search of a way to fill the gaping holes that we feel deep in our hearts. This prescription pain killer crisis is just another symptom of a much deeper problem. \nSo what is the solution? \nPlease feel free to tell us what you think by posting a comment below\u2026 HeyAHuman \nIt\u2019s a combination of insane profits, population control, and keeping people zombified and distracted by addiction. SunnyFlaSnotress \nI admit that I don\u2019t understand the reasoning of painkiller addiction well, but I will guess that the pills provide some elation other than just pain killing. That sense of elation, coupled w/a local drug culture, likely creates community, albeit a pathetic one, and excuses not to participate in the real world. Of course there are also likely those who would rather be doped rather than to endure minor forms of pain. sistersoldier \nIt is extremely and immensely profitable for the drug companies. There will forever be more money in the treatment than in the cure. Holistic medicine is shunned by those who prefer to poison us with chemicals and some of the leading doctors in this field just keep coming up DEAD. \nThough some are for relief of major illnesses or surgeries its the abuse factor that is being discussed here. Drugs are great for two tings, altering reality and creating a temporary sense of euphoria. A population is much easier to control when they have nearly all of the population under control with controlled meds. Michael stated that 80% of all prescription medication is consumed by Americans. Pharmaceutical companies are also one of \u2013 if not the biggest lobbyists on the Hill. \nImagine what would happen if they pulled the plug? Make no mistake about it \u2013 drug use increase is no accident nor warp in a lost generation. It is a dark habit with deadly consequences and many have danced to its \u201cthorn bird\u201d song. \nThe dealers have their orders and they know exactly when to stop the supply. MK Ultra on steroids for an entire nation. \nCare for a little civil unrest anyone? Rick \nThere are many more people around the world who are being softly killed by governments, or the elite eugenicists such as Bill Gates and George Soros who control and manipulate governments. Check out GMO foods, flouride and poison additives in water, heavy metal jet emissions (chem trails) in our air, virus laden vaccines, electronic toxic radiation ( even from the iPad I\u2019m using to write this). The list goes on and on, and our cancer and chronic illness rates go up and up, regardless of what the PhRMA companies throw at us. I do agree with you, naturopathic medicine, proper nutrition, and other preventative measures are clinically significantly greater than the conventional money draining ways we\u2019ve been educated on. Thanks for your post. sistersoldier \nThank you and I agree with you. May the Lord use you to open even more eyes. God bless. Rick \nSunny, that\u2019s right on. We are all different, regardless of how the socialists, communists and depraved creepo politicians tell us we are the same. Not that I\u2019m a tough guy, but I recently had 2 wisdom teeth pulled, had Novocain and a few doses of ibuprofen, and was given a prescription for hydrocodone as well, but never needed it. It didn\u2019t pain me much to go thru this whole process. However, there are many others who have a very low pain threshold, and who do need and take the stronger drugs for the same procedure. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s just life\u2019s differences, and I actually appreciate them. James \nFYI: Novocain is not a painkiller, it is a regional anthestic. Just look at it\u2019s generic name (Procaine). \nIt ends in caine Rick \nDr. James, I appreciate the commentary. You seem to be inferring that I listed it as a pain reliever? Don\u2019t think I did, but again, for readers who might have taken it that way, thanks for the input. Think First \nBecause we\u2019re much easier to control when we\u2019re fat, sick, addicted, drug addled and complacent. Kent Harris \nYou know what would seriously put a huge dent in the amount of pill popping would be to attend church regularly. Unlike going to a bar or some other watering hole there is something about being around fellow believers that gives joy to the heart. To be in the presence of Almighty God along with your brothers and sister is truly a work of the Holy Spirit. \nTherefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others. Philippians 2:1-4 \nlol.. it was very long ago, but i still remember the pain of the boredom On a scale of 1-10, the chances of your idea catching on is -1 ALWAYSTOMORROW \nI too have bad memories from long ago of the boredom. sistersoldier \nFor any endeavor that we pursue it requires a call to maturity. I am not saying that you are not mature in life but rather it requires maturity in God to accept His beauty as he is all together lovely for those who seek His love. Everybody needs love I don\u2019t care who you are. But no one can come to Jesus unless the Father which is in heaven draws them. This is where you will either soften your heart or you will harden it for the day of judgement. \n\u201cFor in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.\u2026\u201d This is for those who accepted Christ but then went backwards again to be partakers of worldly desires. \nI won\u2019t to live forever Sunny, don\u2019t you? By that I mean I want to discover new worlds that I never knew. When God spoke the universe into existence it is still expanding today. I highly doubt that he would waste that much space. Age old mysteries that are locked because humanity cannot appreciate their intrinsic and holy value. I want to know the life I could of had if I had asked God for all the blessings I forfeited because of my disobedience. Blessings in the store room of heaven with my name on them. God is still good even if He does not do another thing for me. \nI want to live forever with God and the family of God. I want to see the angels that covered me while on earth and meet Michael the Arch Angel, the warrior of the saints and the Most High God. I just cannot understand how someone would pass that up because of arrogance or unbelief. If you don\u2019t stand for something (Godly) you will fall for anything. \nI want to spend eternity with those that I loved and they died in the Lord because even if you lose someone to hell you will not meet them there. It is an eternally dark place, because God is light. It is filled with pain of unimaginable proportions. I doubt that you will want to carry on a conversation. Even if it were possible for you to find them you will only know them by their suffering in the flames. \nI am praying for you everyday. SunnyFlaSnotress \nyou don\u2019t really think i read your stuff do u? sistersoldier \nYes, and even if you didn\u2019t God has a way of still holding you accountable as this is one of those moments where you used the free will He gave you to reject once again the gospel of His love. GSOB \n\u201cWe have the freedom to believe, but not the ability.\u201d SunnyFlaSnotress \nGod won\u2019t hold me responsible to read your windy unappreciated spiels. sistersoldier \nthat\u2019s your egotism talking sistersoldier \nBecause you don\u2019t believe God speaks? Or because of my confidence and boldness in His words? I just want what is best for you and that is for the angels in heaven to sign your name in the Lamb\u2019s book of life. I just don\u2019t want to see anyone throw away such a precious gift because it was paid for in blood. Who better to die for or die to than the One who has already died for you? Not only you but for the sins of the whole world. There is no greater love. nevergiveup \nI love how you continue to speak the truth in love. It is a less intense version of David Wilkerson sharing love and faith with Nicky Cruz. Keep up the good work Sister. sistersoldier \nHello Nevergiveup: Thank you and God bless you. My soul rejoices in knowing that you are well and still striving in the eternal knowledge of God. lincolnlincolnlincoln \nit sinks in, ever so slowly Jodie Lynn Gaeta \nI felt that way too, when I was a kid. But now that I am an adult who chooses to go to a house of worship to pray with others, I find that it is a source of strength and inner peace. Malcolm Reynolds \nI\u2019m sure sure the board members here will appreciate your pious clap-trap. Said the buffoon that\u2019s here to spread her pious claptrap about the boredom of socialism. sistersoldier \nI believe she said the boredom of church. Malcolm Reynolds \nYes, she said that about what you said. I\u2019m talking about her. She\u2019s a Hillary sycophant. sistersoldier \nYeah\u2026\u2026.ok, well I don\u2019t have a dog in this fight. Carry on. Malcolm Reynolds \nYea, she isn\u2019t what you could describe as self aware. sistersoldier \nI respectfully recuse myself from your conversation such as in like manner a challenge (a judge, prosecutor, or juror) as unqualified to perform judgmental duties because of a possible conflict of interest or lack of impartiality. My job is to disseminate the gospel to a dying world not assess one\u2019s political correctness. SunnyFlaSnotress \nMalcolm you search for crumbs to pick on like a maggot. Malcolm Reynolds \n\u201cI\u2019m sure sure the board members here will appreciate your pious clap-trap.\u201d \nwhat do you call this? \n\u201cyou don\u2019t really think i read your stuff do u?\u201d \nAnd this? \nSo then crumbs. You are indeed blissfully ignorant of yourself. Preacher62 \nI spent many years staring out the window and writhing in the boredom as well. Then one day God showed me that my life was not about me but about him. I find now that I am never bored because boredom can only come from an inward focus. For those who focus outwardly there is little time for boredom. SunnyFlaSnotress \nI just finally accepted the fact that there ain\u2019t no ruling guy sitting in the sky sistersoldier \nYes there is if He wasn\u2019t there then you would not be here SunnyFlaSnotress \nNo, no.. there isn\u2019t sistersoldier \nYou sound like you are convincing yourself? Having a little trouble with the God seed I planted? I plant, then one will come after me who waters and then God gives the increase! So even if you tune me out the seed is already there. SunnyFlaSnotress \ncause you\u2019re here and keep communicating sistersoldier \nSo you do or you don\u2019t want me to communicate with you? You do realize that this is a Christian based blog don\u2019t you? I\u2019m confused as to why you are here unless it is to look for answers. Please enlighten me. SunnyFlaSnotress \nI don\u2019t want you to communicate with me.. I don\u2019t hate you, but your words are unwelcome and the attention is gnat-like. This blog is under the category of an economic blog. Anything else is an unwritten supposition. sistersoldier \nYou cannot separate God from this blog. The author(s) are Christians. They even have a Christian Youtube Channel. Michael\u2019s assessment of the economy comes from his relationship with God. There are plenty of blogs that are not Christian based. But maybe God had you and those who agree with you to stop by here for a reason so you will be without excuse. \nAtheism is a lie. It is one of those lies where if we tell it often enough it becomes the truth to the non-believer. I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness calling, \u201cClear the way for the LORD in the wilderness; Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God\u201d dadelaw \nDon\u2019t even begin to try to reason with these people. They\u2019re all crazy. I just come to the blog to rip off information, that\u2019s all. The rest is just loony-toons\u2026 Preacher62 \nHe created everything that is, including you and I. To deny him would be to deny our own existence. sistersoldier \nThat makes perfect sense! flautistmaniac \nMaybe there isn\u2019t an imaginary ruler sitting over the sky. If there is a God in control of nature, it certainly isn\u2019t me. Would that I could tell a tree to move for me or my house to clean itself. I could will it all day and get no response. Nature follows it\u2019s own laws and if we have little control over those laws, then whose laws do they follow? sistersoldier \nI really appreciate you! Your reflections of who God is and what He means to you is pure poetry of the soul. May God bless you richly and even more so than He has blessed me. Simply humble and wonderful are your thoughts toward God. Preacher62 \nMy blessings are far beyond my ability to count. However you are one of them. sistersoldier \nand we love to pray for your salvation. thanks for the opportunity antonio \nThank you. Must read this often. sistersoldier \nYou have written the prescription to life though many refuse to receive it. Kent you are correct that worshiping God would circumvent allowing ourselves to be enticed by the wicked trappings of this present world. Yes, to be in the presence of God is all one needs to be whole. \nThe performer/actor behind drugs is Satan. Drug use opens you up to spiritual attacks because it is a stronghold and a vice. There are specific demonic spirits associated with drugs and alcohol abuse which leave you wide open for demonic possession and why it is so hard to \u201ckick the habit\u201d. \nDrug abuse was foretold to increase as another sign that we are approaching the end of days. In order to be used by God we must be sober minded and avoid intoxicating substances. But the deception is growing that drugs can make us feel better when in fact they are numbing a generation to the will of God. \nNo man can serve to masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will hold to the one and despise the other. The laws that apply to human nature subjugate and necessitate that our supreme and our utmost affections can only be fixed to one object. It is the way we are wired which is why I seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and I allow Him to fill me with His Holy Spirit and whatever the Holy Spirit accepts I accept and whatever He rejects I reject. \nJesus is the Great Physician because He is the Son of the Great I AM. El Shaddai \u2013 The God that is more than enough! Rick \nJehovah-Rapha. Amen! sistersoldier \nKeep calling on His name and may He manifest Himself in your life as Your Healer. Preacher62 \nTruth for life right there. Rdawg \nNonsense. Europeans are far more secular than Americans and do not have the same magnitude of problems with addiction. You will find that the religious are every bit as likely to become ensnared in drug addiction as non-religious persons. The problem is that Americans have become used to a culture of quick-fixes for everything; nobody wants to deal with their problems head-on. lincolnlincolnlincoln \nEuro\u2019s will be doing more drugs soon enough when they face their countries destroyed by the muslim hordes ProclaimingGodsTruth \nLet\u2019s make sure that the church you reference is a Bible-believing, Bible-teaching, Christ following church. Not all churches are true Acts 2 churches today. GSOB \nSome say I am of the faith, therefore I am of the elect. Others say I am of the elect, therefore I have faith. \nWhich came first, election or faith? ProclaimingGodsTruth \nOh I get it \u2026\u201criddle-time\u201d? sistersoldier \nIt is not a trap question just a soul searching question. ProclaimingGodsTruth \nOK, see my reply then. sistersoldier \nI have read and it appears that you agree that election comes first. As faith comes by hearing so then by hearing the word of God. We would of necessity need to exist to hear the word of God. By selection we were chosen as those who would have hearts to receive the word of God by faith. All be it that everyone is given a measure of faith but not all will exercise the gift for good. \nNow this is holy a conversation! ProclaimingGodsTruth \nOne stark reminder is what Jesus said in Matt 22:14 \u2013\u201cMany are called but few are chosen.\u201d These are tremendously stunning words that should awaken all Christians everywhere. Shalom sistersoldier \nYes, but too many are distracted with the \u201celections\u201d of politicians to care what God thinks. ProclaimingGodsTruth \nVery correct!!! They are distracting Americans away from the real issues..the Lord\u2019s return and the signs leading up to it. There is also a super abundance of deception in the rhetoric spewed from the lips of these candidates. \nJust a verse on the candidates, the election and America \u2013 Hos 8:4 sistersoldier \nYes Lord! That scripture is so good and so right it is of necessity that those who do not open the Bible read it and may they understand it for their own deliverance! Praise God indeed. May you keep proclaiming God\u2019s truth. \n\u201cThey have set up kings, but not by Me; They have appointed princes, but I did not know it. With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves, That they might be cut off.\u201d Mary Janis \nfaith sistersoldier \nElection came first as it is His spiritual blessing towards those who would inherit salvation. \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,\u2026\u201d God bless. ProclaimingGodsTruth \nFirst of all what is this \u201cfaith\u201d in that you ask here? Christ or \u2026? If Christ, let\u2019s use Heb 12:1-2 as the source text for our discussion. \nBut to clarify, are you talking The Elect? Or just the elect? \nSince the elect denotes one that has been chosen, our faith in Christ results in one being in the fellowship of the elect, meaning all those called and chosen and faithful. Matt 22:14; Rev 17:14 \nOk, what say you? You after a predestination type discussion? Maybe\u2026 \n*** Remember now that Christ was with the Father from the beginning. Rick \nKent, totally agree with your opinion here, in fact I was going to post something similar. Being a pharmacy doctor, I see it all too often, people suffering, and in pain. However, my wife and I recently joined the Catholic Church, and follow our theology, and teachings, and vows we took to join. We are regular weekly attenders at mass, and are deeply in love with Jesus Christ, yet I could easily be included in the group of 60 million abusers of alcohol that Michael talks about. So while I know I sin against God, and I know what I do is wrong, I still do it. And I struggle against it, I will never give up the battle as long as I am afflicted with this thorn in my side. We each have our \u201cthorn\u201d. I think the larger problem may be that many people are just waking up to the culture of death we live in, right here in the USA, and they don\u2019t want to face it. They do give up the struggle against sin. We kill over 3000 babies a day in this country, and yet we want Hillary Clinton as our next president?? The Queen of the Culture of Death?? And the very same people who will vote for her are the ones on the anti-psych, anti-depressants, and pain killers. They can\u2019t cope with what they are doing, how they are living day to day. They no longer have the ability, or desire to connect the dots, yet deep down they know it\u2019s wrong, and there will be that day! That day will be the moment they accept the door of Mercy, and totally confess and repent, and convert, or that day will be the day of judgement. I need not describe what that will be like. In my estimation there is no \u201cprogram\u201d, no education, no amount of dollars, gold or silver, no smart talk from slick politicians that can save us now, it will only be by the great mercy of God. flautistmaniac \nI think the key we are missing is to acknowledge our fallibility. We want to believe we are good, yet we would crucify Jesus for one pill or one drink. Until we accept our evil and love ourselves anyways, there is no way out. Of course, once you do this, you can no longer hate any sinner, knowing that you are just as fallible. Rick \nI believe you are right. We fail to acknowledge our fallibility, our humanness. We\u2019ve lost our sense of humility, of reverence toward God. We live in an era of entitlement think instead of greatfulness think. We buy into the programing of the media that it\u2019s all about us, someone owes us something. Government becomes god, and is the king of the culture of death. Liberty First \nGreat post, thank you Kent. MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse \nAfter a tremendous amount of work, my wife and I have finally completed the first episode of our new television program.

Illegal \nFfThe richest country in the world has a population that won\u2019t educate itself about living a healthy life. Peopl antonio \nNicely put. SunnyFlaSnotress \nSome may also be using the pills to fight boredom, depression, etc and the answer may be reverse.. to give the addict new challenges and means of achieving. goldminer \nSo what is the solution? Beer. Hops are a natural pain reliever. Works for me. Haven\u2019t seen a pill pusher for many many years. Don\u2019t need no bible thumpin either. Ricardo \nthat wine was grapejuice. The English for wine doesn\u2019t make any difference between fermented and unfermented but the original language tells you what was unfermented and what was fermented. Jesus turned water into unfermented wine. GSOB \nI will venture to guess that alcohol addiction far outstrips pain killer addiction. GSOB \n\u201cOur bodies have been redeemed from deserved condemnation and hopeless slavery by the atoning sacrifice of Christ. We are to be clean, as vessels fitted for our Master\u2019s use. Being united to Christ as one spirit, and bought with a price of unspeakable value, the believer should consider himself as wholly the Lord\u2019s, by the strongest ties. May we make it our business, to the latest day and hour of our lives, to glorify God with our bodies, and with our spirits which are his.\u201d\u2013 Romans 15:13 Priszilla \nGuns are good painkillers. No more pain after you shoot yourself. Chicken? How about suicide by cop? But not recommended. Buy a gun yourself. And have lots of training at the shooting range. The profit doesn\u2019t only come from gun sales but also ammo. billtheguy \nWhen people go to the doctor or the emergency room, the question is asked of them: \u201cOn a scale 1-10 how much pain do you have?\u201d This is where it hypothetically starts. Doctors use visuals too, but I believe people can endure some pain. Doctors only have one or two ways to deal with pain, and drugs are one. Do doctors get kickbacks from drug companies? Steeve Girard \nA lot of pains are dietary of origin. Like lactose intolerance, 1,3,7 methyl-xanthine intolerance, allergic reactions etc\u2026 Rather than telling the truth and put us on a path to modify our diet to fit the intolerances, they give you a prescription for pills to neutralize the problem. And they are rarely non-permanent, you are most likely to use them for the rest of your life. . Modifying a diet is not hard\u2026 you just have to accept sacrifices. I used to like milky cheese, yogurt, ice cream, dark chocolate, quik mix, chocolate syrup, etc\u2026 and now those products are either drastically reduced to my tolerance levels, substitued with a similar product without the intolerant substance or radically eliminated. sistersoldier \nYes, drug reps (representatives) visit doctor\u2019s offices regularly. I worked for a medical facility many years ago as an account representative. Every Wednesday and Friday we could expect very expensive \u201cfree\u201d lunches. The drug companies would spare no costs and would make sure everyone who worked in the office received a meal on the days they would visit the good doctors. They also provided plenty of free samples. This is where you get your samples when offered by your doctor. They come from the drug companies delivered by the reps to promote their product. Not because the doctor found them to be good but because the pharmaceutical company has been good to them. \nAnd yes again as the human body can tolerate pain and for good reason. Pain is nature\u2019s indicator to send signals to the area of the body that needs healing. This is why after major surgeries your doctor should advise you to get up and walk, almost immediately for some, so that you will kick start your own healing process. James \nPain is nature\u2019s indicator to send signals to the area of the body that needs healing \nNo it\u2019s not. Pain is an indication that you should stop whatever you are doing that is causing the pain. Ex, stop putting your hand in a boiling pot of water. sistersoldier \nPain starts at the source of an injury or inflammation, whether it\u2019s your toe or your lower back. When you injure yourself, the body\u2019s automatic response is to stimulate pain receptors, which in turn release chemicals, says Dr. Tongprasert. Sanjaykumar Jobalia \nI just went through the comments appearing before I sat down to write my own. Some of them are with a tinge of humour, sarcasm or comment on the current American way of living. \nThe solution lies in the biggest and most dreaded mafia of all times. \u201cthe pharma companies\u201d . They will put ISIS to shame. I used to say such things about INDIA which is my origin. But I think applies to whole world. 1) Big Companies including Pharma 2) Politicians 3) Senior Government Officers 4) Print & Electronic Media & lastly 5) Top Judiciary . There is nexus of these 5 almost anywhere in the world & the nexus is simply invincible. Unless we make a move in a direction to break this nexus, things are not going to change. \nAs far as drugs go, this nexus simply manages to suppress ill effects of such drugs, cheaper & far better alternate forms to cure available to mankind. \nIT IS ALL COMMERCE SunnyFlaSnotress \nI think that\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s all about addicts and addict culture. When my boyfriend had legitimate need for pain pills, he has always been given a very difficult time. antonio \nGood post. Steeve Girard \nThe main reason why the pill commerce exist, is the requirement of performance that exists today. Even when you are old and retired, you will be needed to be in shape to deal with the BS the system throws at them. And one way to do so, is by taking pills to numb pain, pills to boost metabolism, pills to control aging. Pills for this, pill for that. . People starting with the Baby Boomer generation have been indoctrinated in a mentality of the \u201cforever young\u201d. They want to be Superman forever (without falling from their horse and become cripple). However, the Mother of Us All, Nature makes sure we get old, weak and painfully disfunctional. Whence the need to consume fixes in the form of pills. . As long people will not accept their own mortality and leave the system knowing they can\u2019t cope with it. They will take those fixes. . The companies knows that, and all their publicity stunts are based on the benefits of taking their drugs. Giving them the money, and causing an addiction to the general public. Because the public is addicted, they can slowly increase the price of the fixes. And you know the rest of the story. sere \nStocks rebound. Change subject and talk about painkillers. Lol SunnyFlaSnotress \nYes, digressions are all too rampant on this board. Ted \nAgree with the folks who believe tptb have this all under control. Go live your life. Malcolm Reynolds \nAnd when they take a dump again in the next week? Should we come back and Lol at you? jox \nI don\u2019t remember your comments last year. And I can\u2019t access your history of comments. As Malcom asks you, \u00bfwill you come back in the next crash? VigilanteCaregiver \nWe get pain killers for the Wife\u2019s conditions. And neurotransmitter meds, dementia meds, seizure meds, diabetes meds, anti-spasm meds, etc. \nNot worried about addiction. Try the #$%&ing cost! Just the neurotransmitter meds, even with two insurances, still gouges us $200 a month! Same thing for the seizure meds. The diabetic meds are a little cheaper, but the test strips and syringes are ridiculous!! \nFeds force us to BUY insurance at gunpoint (still unconstitutional which makes it illegal for them to do); they didn\u2019t bother including language that says insurance will pay out! Just like paying for another useless, worthless, irredeemable bureaucracy (high-paid welfare recipients). Steeve Girard \nYes it is ridiculous to fight old age and death. It will eventually happen. Why pay for it? Orange Jean \nSteeve, my understanding is that his wife is quite young (I think he said in her 30s) but had a bad accident of some sort and has traumatic brain injury. Nothing to do with old age\u2026 from previous posts\u2026he sounds like a loving husband who tries very hard to take care of his wife, their young kids, and himself. You could have been a little more sensitive. \nBesides\u2026 you don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to get old?? Rick \nWell who do you think wrote obamacare? VigilanteCaregiver \nTruthfully: based on results, dire enemies did this. Rick \nThat certainly could be said. It was big insurance company lobbyist and lawyers who crafted the majority of the bill. Guess they insulated themselves with mandated profits forever? Or at least until some President with common sense comes to office, takes out HIS pen and phone, and abolishes this criminal piece of legislation that is slowly killing us all, and more rapidly killing our economy. VigilanteCaregiver \nThat bill was obviously crafted a long time ago. There were far more groups and usurpers involved than just lawyers and insurance folks. \nMy problem is this: what actually compels the next president and Congress to do what you\u2019re wisely stating above? \nI said to local candidate recently that if he\u2019d put up his personal fortune as security or take out a bond in their name, then I\u2019d be more inclined to believe what he\u2019s saying. He asked why he should; I said to cover my losses from his inevitable corruption and mistakes, and to punish him for not doing his job. He didn\u2019t like that; neither did the other candidates within earshot. These skunks won\u2019t ever do such a thing, obviously. It had to be said, though. c_chandler \nhave you sought another doctor to try to limit some of these? VigilanteCaregiver \nWe are seeing several doctors. They don\u2019t prescribe unless they have to. This isn\u2019t a normal situation; herbal medicines can\u2019t handle it anymore and pharmaceuticals are becoming less reliable with supply. Malcolm Reynolds \nI\u2019m \u201caddicted\u201d to prescrip painkillers. It\u2019s not hard and it doesn\u2019t happen because they\u2019re happy fun times. \nI have chronic and extreme pain in my back (2 blown and degenerative discs L1 and L5, and arthritis from L1 to L5) and hips (bursitis). \nDoing any activity where you\u2019re hunched over (like doing the dishes), sends my back into a tizzy. \nI throw out my back almost routinely. I threw it out last week and spent 3 days working from bed, and the other two moving realllly slow. I\u2019m extremely lucky I can actually do that. \nLast year was the first time I threw out my back and literally could not walk. It was so damn painful. \nI breeze thru 90 -10/325 Hydrocodone a month and have had to withdraw from them at least 3 times because the Doc wont write another script. Creepy Pedro \nBeen through opiate w/d\u2026.not really bad but still sucks\u2026Benzo w/d is from the devil. Wouldnt wish that on anyone. Malcolm Reynolds \n\u201copiate w/d\u2026.not really bad but still sucks\u201d Yep. That\u2019s about how I\u2019d describe it too. Creepy Pedro \nGet your liver tested if you plan to be on them along time. As long as you don\u2019t O.D, which is pretty hard to do (unless you are just plain crazy), you will be ok. Benzos w/d and alcohol w/d are the only two that can kill you. Benzo w/d feels like opiate times 100. GSOB \nNow\u2026 that\u2019s what I like to see\u2026 helping each other out and building each other up. Your experience lends itself in empathy to Malcolm R. Romans 8:28 \nIt\u2019s like a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.. at least I imagine.. SunnyFlaSnotress \nThere we go.. you are on SSDI and have walking issues.. Admit it.. I was sorta right. Malcolm Reynolds \nyou are on SSDI and have walking issues.. Mmmm, nope. Bet I can still outwalk your stupid a$$. But then you spend a great deal of time on your back so\u2026. SunnyFlaSnotress \nI make you angry because I am close to your sad truth. I just pretty much totally moved myself. Endurance is a strong point of mine. I doubt you could outwalk me. You just told us how frail you are. Malcolm Reynolds \nI make you angry because I am close to your vulnerabilities. \nYou\u2019ve never made me angry. I think you\u2019re a simpleton and I make fun of you because of it. But I\u2019m interested in hearing the whole \u2018close to my vulnerabilities\u2019 theory. \nused to be \nColor me impressed. I used to run at least 8 miles a day at lunch when I was in the Corps and lifted plenty of weights. But yea, that is definitely \u201cused to\u201d. \nThese days, DESPITE my pain, I do karate 3 times a week, do monthly campouts in Scouts with my sons, and did the 10 mile hike around Little Wild Horse Canyon/Bell Canyon loop in Goblin Valley, Utah this past fall with ease. WONDERFUL slot canyons, BTW. I highly recommend. DESPITE my pain, I maintain a very active life. \nThe pain is worse when I\u2019m sedentary. \nbut if you are going to criticize, I will point out the reality. \nThe reality is you don\u2019t know a damned thing about me, you just seem to think you do. Orange Jean \nI\u2019m sorry to hear you are struggling with both pain and addition. I also have degenerative disc disease, plus severe arthritis in my spine, knees, neck and hands. I can barely walk now (have to use a walker at all times). \nI do have a prescription for hydroconone but do not use it daily; I\u2019ve been able to keep the pain down to a tolerable level by alternating days when I use just Tylenol (cannot use asperin or Ibuprophen any more due to bleeding) and try to use the Vicodin only on weekends (because many more things I do with chores are painful) or when there are bad storms. I get that awful arthritis pain when storms come through, sometimes to the point I can barely walk from my bed to the bathroom. But so far that seems to work for me, you might want to consider giving that kind of regime a try. \nGood luck with trying to deal with it; people who don\u2019t have chronic pain really don\u2019t seem to understand at all. But it can happen to anyone, only a car crash away (and you don\u2019t have to be the one causing the crash\u2026 a lot of this started for me when I was tailgated hard by someone trying to run a red light\u2026 through me!). Malcolm Reynolds \nYikes! You\u2019re doing much better with the meds than I do. Good for you! Orange Jean \nAs someone said\u2026 it is individual. Probably in my case I am doing better with the meds than some because I have seen the bad effects of prescription drug addition in my mother, so I am seriously paranoid about taking drugs\u2026 \nOn the other hand you seem to be doing a lot better than I am with mobility. \nLest I go into pity party mode though.. there always seems to be someone worse off. I work in a MTF; the minute I seem to be feeling sorry for myself along comes some wounded warrior guy in his 20s, missing both legs. Puts things in perspective. REALIST \nRead 2 Books: \u201cWHEAT BELLY, by Dr. Davis\u201d and \u201cGRAIN BRAIN\u201d by Dr. Perlmutter. \nThe consumption of \u201cmodern food\u201d is at the heart of this. Add the fact we work too much, consume too much (creating stress with that cycle), and lack of exercise leads to this problem. \nWe have completely warped and deformed out biology. \nTo change you life you have to change your life.

Goldenpuff2 \nBeing a person with a pain condition requiring me to use pain meds in order to function on a daily basis, pain meds and their users get a bad rap. It is the PEOPLE who take these meds when they do not need them. It is the PEOPLE who steal from others who actually do need them. Most docs are compassionate people. By design, their job is to BELIEVE people when they tell docs they hurt. Of course, there are bad docs but most are not so again it is the PEOPLE who choose to beg, borrow, lie and steal to get these pills who are the problem. I also take an old anti-seizure med that works for pain by calming the nerve endings. It takes me a month or better to be able to increase this med yet I\u2019m snooping one day looking up dosing or something and run across a forum where people are talking openly about taking this med \u2013 and a heck of a lot more than I would EVER take in one dose \u2013 and then going to the freaking Mall!!!! to \u2018see what happens.\u2019 Now is that stupid or what?

Pain becomes chronic due to inflammation that does not resolve. Inflammation can be caused by injury, toxins, tumors, poor circulation and even eating the wrong food that sets off a cytokine storm in the body. Bad oils and grains can cause leaky gut that can lead to pain. People who live with pain are not bad people but they are miserable and suffering and they need relief from pain to have quality of life. Many things can be done to help pain to include herbs such as turmeric and boswellia and innovations such as tens units or earthing. But the Doctors do not advise of alternative and safer pain relief modalities, they only push narcotics or anti-inflammatories that mess up the adrenal glands or kidneys. Insurance will not pay for anything alternative, insurance only pays for prescription pain pills. After awhile pain pills cause tolerance, which means the body requires larger does to achieve the same amount of pain relief. People that need higher does \u201care not addicted\u201d but have developed \u201cnormal tolerance\u201d. Our health care system needs changed so that pain is treated at the root cause and not just a cover up of the pain symptom. Do not forget 1) the worst thing a doctor can do is to kill you. 2) The second worse thing a doctor can do is to cure you. SunnyFlaSnotress \nIf the people really need the meds, I don\u2019t consider them addicts.. just patients. Orange Jean \nI go to an ortopaedic clinic and they prescribe physical therapy a lot of the time, including many of the things you suggest as alternatives and my health insurance will pay up to 72 physical therapy visits a year. Most years lately I\u2019ve had to use that much and more, and much of what they do helps to a point\u2026 but are not permanent cures. \nIn addition to cortisone shots and various pain meds, I\u2019ve been given compression stockings (for lymphodema),. back traction, neck traction, a lot of excercises, heat and message, tens unit, cold laser therapy etc. Could have chosen chiropractor adjustments as well, but personally those made me feel worse. I\u2019ve also tried a number of herbs which you\u2019ve suggested, which also did nothing. \nJust sayin\u2019!! I do have both \u201cgood\u201d days and \u201cbad days\u201d\u2026 and I try to be thankful for the good ones. Traci \nreal. Acute pain caused by an injury can become chronic pain if the injury does not resolve. (think spinal pain). Often pain has no specific known cause but develops from generalized inflammation. Inflammation can be triggered by autoimmune disorders such as fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis and food allergies. Grains and bad oils can lead to leaky gut which allows non digested proteins to leak out of the gut and into the body which will then cause a cytokine storm and abnormal immune complexes, that leads to generalized pain. Sometimes pain is caused by nerve pain due to diabetes or lack of B12. Pain is multi-faceted and has numerous etiologies. But PAIN is REAL and people suffering from chronic pain need compassion and help not blame. Pain is helped by narcotics, steroids and herbs such as turmeric and boswellia. Alternative products such as tens units, earthing and DMSO can also provide amazing relief. When people go to doctors, (whom they trust to have their best interest), they are only provided with narcotics and steroids, not alternative products. The insurance company will only pay for prescription meds. The AMA and the prescription industry have a partnership. If a doctor dare suggests alternative pain relief they can be in legal trouble. A truth about opioids is that they causes \u201cdependence\u201d which means as the body adjusts to the pain med, a larger does is required to provide the same amount of pain relief. Many people confuse \u201cdependence\u201d with \u201caddiction\u201d. People need relief from pain and doctors whom they trust, let them down. I do not have pain now, but I have I have had it the past. I had to become my own doctor and heal myself. Praise God for the internet! I am also a registered nurse. Orange Jean \nThank you for your kind post\u2026 it is so strange to hear how many people blame someone for being in physical pain and have NO idea what that is about. Mark A. Kuntz \nPeople just don\u2019t get it. The true problem is \u201csin\u201d. Sin is killing us and we are trying to solve a spiritual problem through natural means, and it will not nor never can work. We will not solve any problems with money or programs. It never has worked and it never will work. Only one way to solve our problems. Be humble before God and repent for our sins. God said in 2nd Chronicles 7:14 that if we would humble ourselves and seek His face that He would \u201cheal our land\u201d. Its that simple. All of the worlds problems are rooted in our failure to trust in and obey God. We turn our backs on a loving Father who knows what is best for us and then wonder what went wrong and why things are always getting worse, in spite of the billions of dollars spent and the promises of politicians and every four years we really believe if we just can get \u201cour person\u201d elected, the country will all magically turn around. What a joke! Turn to God, that\u2019s our only hope. And just to be clear, I could care less what any of the haters of God think. Orange Jean \nSo you\u2019re telling me I have severe arthritis and chronic pain due to \u201csin\u201d? Somehow, I think you\u2019re wrong about that! CharlesH \nFor a very long time now, one of my biggest concerns has been what will happen in the U.S. should suddenly and without any warning there be a supply disruption of medications from the manufacturers to the doctors, hospitals and pharmacies? I have read \u2013 on many legitimate websites \u2013 that there is a maximum of a 30 day supply on hand at any given time. I\u2019ve seen first hand what a severe addiction can do to someone \u2013 it\u2019s horrible enough if they have their drugs (I don\u2019t sugar coat it by calling them \u2018meds\u2019) \u2013 but imagine suddenly they\u2019re not there. All hell literally breaks loose. John E \nBlame the pills, blame the doctors, blame the religions, blame pharma companies, blame everything\u2026..but don\u2019t ever look in the mirror and say I let these pills rob me of my soul for a little bit of relief from real life\u2026.because after all that could be a bit painful too and require some changes. \nLong gone are the days when people went to the dentist and had a tooth pulled with a little local anesthetic or shot of whiskey. Sure end of life or serious injuries can go a little smoother with pain killers but I have trouble believing that millions of Americans need that kind of pain relief from hard drugs everyday. \nThis is the new America, a nation of spoiled sissies and cry babies. boo.hoo\u2026hoo. Please don\u2019t ask for my sympathy, you did this to yourself. Dave of OK \nwhat is going to happen to this country once the pharmaceuticals are not there to fill the need? We are going to have a lot of near zombies roaming the land. This depression is going to be a lot worse than the last depression. Not as many people were on antidepressants in the 1930\u2019s. grumpyhillbilly \nI hope they become zombies. Unfortunately it will likely be mass psychotic episodes. HENK-2 \nIf Americans (I suppose you mean USA citizens) are so happy. \nI have trouble with that. \nHow can 100 million unemployed people be happy? \nOr the 45 million on food stamps? \nI think they are very unhappy and the circumstances they live in would account for taking drugs that lessen the mental pain. \nHow many drugs are prescribed for people in nursing homes or for prisoners to keep them in a mental fog to keep them quiet. \nNever trust the pharmaceutical industry. \nI am 81 years of age and am convinced that there are parts of drugs that MAKE you dependent on them e.g I am on 2 prescription drugs which I don\u2019t want or need but if I do not take them I lie awake for hours; this is not healthy as it is easy to think about things which are better left alone. Deal with problems but do not dwell on them. \nPainkillers: \nThe opium poppy is the king of painkillers even when synthesized. \nBecause of chronic pain I was on opoids from 1991 till last year. \nI was on codeine and progressed to methadone (no, I was never a junkie, this was for pain) and suboxone. \nThe latter is so restricted that the head of the alcohol and drug administration in the entire shire (county) treated me personally. \nI received 7 pills per week, pick up on Sunday but do not bother to come on Saturday because you are not due yet. \nI do not know if suboxone was responsible for what happened but a year ago I did a cold turkey on all painkillers and do not miss them, even when I suffer I can look at them and the memories of chronic constipation come back as horror stories and indignities. I am looking at them now. \nI should say that I have a history of doing cold turkeys with alcohol and smoking. \nIt is important to understand that you cannot give those things up to please other people, you should only do it because YOU want to. \nIn my case my first grandchild was due and I promised myself that no grandchild would ever see me drunk. This was in 1980. And none have. \nMany people have heard the expression: to hit rock bottom. But it is rarely defined. \nIn my case it means: I have reached the point beyond which I do not want to go. \nI hope I have been of some help and wish everybody all the best; not willpower because that is soluble in alcohol. James \nconvinced that there are parts of drugs that MAKE you dependent Yes, they activate dopamine reception and production. It is what happens if you try to inhibit opiate receptors. James \nsuboxone. \nUm, soboxone is the brand name for naloxone, and Buprenorphine. Two drugs that are used to treat opiod addiction. Deanna Clark \nWhy am I not surprised that this article about the suffering of millions gets only a bunch of religious arguments and cold judgement? This monster hurts families, friendships, whole towns. It drains money from businesses, savings, family, and brings sweet girls into prostitution\u2026boys too. Yet there\u2019s not a word here of sympathy or mercy. Shame\u2026 grumpyhillbilly \nI don\u2019t know. Seems like your average drug user feels sorry enough for themselves without my pity. Sorry, my user cousin is the master of exploiting empathy. Makes me the opposite any more. Deanna Clark \nBut they have families that can ruin themselves trying to help. Then there\u2019s the children and spouses of the addict\u2026the toll is horrible. All over the US are grandparents raising grandchildren, spending their savings, taking no vacations\u2026always worried their grown child will overdose. The current crisis in STDs is due to the drugs for sex habits. They say future addicts can be predicted as children\u2026they see every attempt to guide or advise them as an encroachment on their freedom. They have no docility\u2026pig headed and stubborn\u2026.and they quit only when they are good and ready. Why so many now? Like junk food, booze, hook-ups and all\u2026the answer is always, \u201cBut it makes me feel soooo good.\u201d So maybe it does trace back to the whole world view pushed in our culture. freethedacks \nthe solution is to legalize cannabis. Cannabis is a non-narcotic mood elevator and pain reliever without the inherent addiction problem of drugs. Problem is the control freaks have lumped cannabis in with very strong drugs, and have even labeled it as a gateway to things like cocaine and heroin. This has been proven to be completely false. Cannabis is not even technically a rug, but an herb in it\u2019s natural state. It is the totem herb of humanity \u2013 it has been a companion plant that has served mankind in many ways for centuries. It\u2019s prohibition has people seeking alternatives, which end up being all the bad stuff that is easier to get. Legalize cannabis and watch the heroin epidemic go away grumpyhillbilly \nC\u2019mon pot is easy to purchase. Nor is it the answer to a miserably unhappy populace. My cure would be to end the big old pity party. James \nA drug is anything that alters bodily function. Drugs can be herbs/plants.

Say no to your doctor some day, then sit back to avoid the subsequent head explosion. Chances are your insurance won\u2019t pay for no. Which all leads to a mind numbed populace. Now why do I think that is what our ruling oligarchs want? Orange Jean \nI\u2019m sorry to hear how many of you seem to mix up people who are drug addicts who got that way to have \u201cfun\u201d with people who may have become addicts through having serious chronic pain and bad advice on how to manage it. There are also plenty of people there who have nothing but chronic physical pain due to injuries or disease who are prescribed these drugs to control the pain. I\u2019m one of them. \nMy body is deteriorating and I have chronic pain\u2026 sometimes severe to the point where I can barely walk. I do use drugs when I need to, but try to keep it to a minimum. I do not believe I am addicted because I can still choose what to use when, but I do understand there are risks involved. The problem is for some of us, the pain levels can be so bad you cannot function at all in life. I have a job and I live alone, so I need to continue to function as there is no one out there going to do things for me I need all the time. \nAnd no, sorry\u2026 but I do not think going to church is going to fix it. True for some people if their problem is an addiction due to weak morals or something\u2026 but not if it\u2019s due to severe pain. It is unfortunate that there are NO totally safe drugs to use to control severe chronic pain. \nEver hear of Job? I don\u2019t think God promises us we will all be happy and healthy all of the time. Sometimes people luck out and sometimes they do not. And despite some people\u2019s assumption that you can stay in good health just by eating \u201cright\u201d and excercising\u2026 you never know if something will come upon you and ruin your health. It may be a disease you never saw coming, something you inherited, or something as unavoidable as someone crashing into you when you are driving or riding in a vehicle (or biking or walking for that matter). lincolnlincolnlincoln \nwhy? maybe because of the previous article\u2026. Willard Ferch \nUnder communism there is little to hope for. Russia became over-run with alcoholism and the abortion rate was through the roof. As our nation declines, hope will diminish. Placing our hope in the correct place is the answer, and that place is in the Lord. Fiddlin \nJesus Christ is the solution Buffet \nIf these weaklings just quit crying every time they have a hangnail, then the sissies would never have any problems. I\u2019ve had four orthopaedic surgeries and never taken so much as ONE pill of that rubbish!! It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t stop \u2013 they don\u2019t WANT to stop, because they\u2019re a bunch of strung out losers. DMCasey \nIn spite of so many abusing these drugs, please keep in mind that there are many who actually NEED them for serious pain relief\u2013for example, those who have terminal illnesses, incapacitating nerve pain, chronic severe pain that keeps them from any kind of normal life. \nWhat will happen to those who really need it if the government takes it off the market, for example? Because people abuse something why should those who are in desperate need suffer for their choices by perhaps having to come off the meds they need? Charlie Payne \nLet me think? We are an aging, success conscience society that in order to be successful, most of the time people have to work wy more on average than 40 hours a week, more like 10 \u2013 12 and sometimes 6 days or 7 days a week for periods of time, At very often back breaking work. For 20 or 30 or 40 years and now is living longer because we are what, the most successful Country on Earth\u2026 Now you wonder why so many people who are living longer have more diseases and injuries, but this weird man who is Surgeon General who thinks it is better for them/us to feel more pain, not less is healthier for all of us!

                              "text": "Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire Hillary Clinton is the architect of US foreign policy failures in Libya and Syria.   We ve heard that statement many times over the course of this US election cycle, but exactly how much truth is there to it? After researching this issue, one quickly learns that it s not only true, it s an understatement. She wasn t just an architect, she was a chief instigator. Clinton s main source of resume credibility is her tenure as US Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013. During that time, Clinton resided over the planning and conception of two devastating conflicts, Libya and Syria. These two disasters will ultimately define both the Obama and Clinton legacies, and not for the reasons one might think. I would like to stress that the case being made here is not a political one, it is a moral and ethical inquiry into the actions and conduct of a public official.Before we get into Libya, which itself is a detailed and grave tale of nation building gone wrong, let s look closely at Syria   a conflict (not a Civil War) which has been dominating the international conversation for the last 4 years, but even more intensely in the last 18 months. Thus far, the results of US policy are abominable.What ownership does Clinton have over today s Syria? Today, the conflict is still being fuelled by tens of thousands of US and Gulf-backed militants, mostly of foreign origin, who comprise multiple Takfiri terrorist groups which the US insist calling  rebels.  This conclave includes the Islamic State (ISIS/Daesh), Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria), Arar al Sham, Nour al-din al-Zenki, Jaish al-Fatah (The Army of Conquest), along with many others. These armed groups are occupying strategic civilian areas throughout Syria, and it is a statement of fact that these terrorists are using civilian populations as human shields.A US-led  Coalition  is currently flying over Syria and Iraq, supposedly  fighting ISIS,  but is also coming dangerously close to conflict with both the Syrian and Russian militaries.Although this situation is now way beyond the pale, there was a time back in 2012 when a genuine diplomatic intervention could have helped to alter a fatal course of events.Hillary Clinton played a crucial role in initiating the current disaster.During a presidential primary debate in Milwaukee in February 2016, Clinton was quick to boast about her many  achievements  as Secretary of State, especially in Syria: You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. It s a nice statement, but like so many of Clinton s policy eulogies, it has no basis in reality.Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development Solutions, sets Clinton straight explaining, In 2012, Clinton was the obstacle, not the solution, to a ceasefire being negotiated by UN Special Envoy Kofi Annan. It was US intransigence   Clinton s intransigence   that led to the failure of Annan s peace efforts in the spring of 2012, a point well-known among diplomats. Despite Clinton s insinuation in the Milwaukee debate, there was (of course) no 2012 ceasefire, only escalating carnage. Clinton bears heavy responsibility for that carnage, which has by now displaced more than 10 million Syrians and left more than 250,000 dead. Clinton s job, like most US diplomats, was to uphold the public facade that Washington is engaging in its usual list of honorable pursuits like cease fires,  peace plans  and protecting human rights   while simultaneously helping to advance a covert agenda that achieves the exact opposite: destabilization, escalation of violence, flooding the region with weapons, and of course, working to overthrow the government of Syria. We want to pay special attention to the weapons trafficking part. Clinton was pivotal   not only in coordinating with the Gulf states, but also giving political legitimacy to arming the  moderate rebels  (now commonly recognized as terrorists).Although the initial effort to fuel the armed insurgency in Syria was organized through Libya under the office of Secretary Clinton (which we ll demonstrate below), later efforts were formalized through a series of large weapons shipments out of NATO countries like Croatia, and then through other US-sanctioned covert smuggling projects like Operation Timber Sycamore, where the CIA, with the approval of President Obama, organized weapons shipments into Syria via Turkey and Jordan, but with Saudi Arabia footing the bill for that clandestine operation. The New York Times confirmed certain details of this in January 2016: American officials have not disclosed the amount of the Saudi contribution, which is by far the largest from another nation to the program to arm the rebels against President Bashar al-Assad s military. But estimates have put the total cost of the arming and training effort at several billion dollars. Perhaps the most important aspect of this story is this: it is absolutely illegal under International Law for foreign nations to conspire and trafficking arms into a country with the intent to overthrow the government of a nation-state.Now that might be a cause for concern for those wanting to recognize the international rule of law, but the United States, the Obama and Clinton regime has done this without any compunction at all. History shows however, that such overt flouting of international law places the entire basis of the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations at risk. Beyond this, it is also a running violation of US law in terms of providing material support (weapons, cash, supplies, intelligence and logistical support, and even political backing) to internationally recognized terrorist organizations. On those two points alone, Hillary Clinton should be not only disqualified for public office in the US, but should also face another criminal indictment for her role, along with every other US public official involved in sanctioning these operations, including Barack Obama, Senator John McCain, and a number of other US officials like Mike Rogers, former Republican Congressman from Michigan and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee when Timber Sycamore began.  FRIENDS OF SYRIA  : Secretary Clinton with Saudi and Qatari government officials in 2012, conspiring to destroy Syria.From 2011, Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was effectively the public-facing CEO of the cynically titled,  Friends of Syria.  This was essentially a lobbying tour, bringing together NATO members, the Arab League and the  Syrian Opposition  all together to promote a policy of regime change for Syria. In reality, it was really a vehicle for raising money and planning for war. Here Clinton was flanked by her Saudi Arabian and Qatari donors to the Clinton Foundation, along with then UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, Turkey s prime minister, Recep Tayip Erdogan, a hand-picked puppet government-in-exile called the  Syrian National Council,  and other  stakeholders    all vying for a piece of Syria.Behind the pomp and circumstance, however, all parties were openly conspiring to arm militants for the purpose of upending the government in Damascus. Clinton effectively steered this process throughout her time in the cabinet   a destructive process which has led to the bloodbath we see today. To any rational observer, the whole enterprise would be viewed as a failure; in terms of human loss, the refugee crisis, sectarian violence, and breeding terrorism for the next 30 or 40 years   and yet, somehow Hillary Clinton is counting this as one of her  achievements.  Here, Sachs offers an accurate take on Clinton s abysmal legacy in Syria: .. she joined Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and right-wing Israelis to try to isolate, even defeat, Iran. In 2010, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria to attempt to wrest Syria from Iran s influence. Those talks failed. Then the CIA and Clinton pressed successfully for Plan B: to overthrow Assad.When the unrest of the Arab Spring broke out in early 2011, the CIA and the anti-Iran front of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey saw an opportunity to topple Assad quickly and thereby to gain a geopolitical victory. Clinton became the leading proponent of the CIA-led effort at Syrian regime change.In early 2011, Turkey and Saudi Arabia leveraged local protests against Assad to try to foment conditions for his ouster. By the spring of 2011, the CIA and the US allies were organizing an armed insurrection against the regime. On August 18, 2011, the US Government made public its position:  Assad must go. Since then and until the recent fragile UN Security Council accord, the US has refused to agree to any ceasefire unless Assad is first deposed. The US policy under Clinton and until recently has been: regime change first, ceasefire after. After all, it s only Syrians who are dying. Annan s peace efforts were sunk by the United States  unbending insistence that U.S.-led regime change must precede or at least accompany a ceasefire. As the Nation editors put it in August 2012:The US demand that Assad be removed and sanctions be imposed before negotiations could seriously begin, along with the refusal to include Iran in the process, doomed [Annan s] mission.Despite the billions spent on arming and training  rebels , the millions of refugees and the hundreds of thousands dead   Assad did not  go  as per the grand plan.Things continue to go septic. A recently released WikiLeaks email from a 2014 exchange between Clinton campaign chair, then White House advisor to President Obama, John Podesta, where the pair openly discuss common knowledge that the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS terrorists. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region,  Clinton wrote. This effort will be enhanced by the stepped up commitment in the [Kurdish Regional Government]. The Qataris and Saudis will be put in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure. In his recent interview with Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange explains an unsettling criminal connection between Clinton and her family foundation: All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some  rogue  princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS. Aside from verifying what many already suspected, this proves that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepted millions of dollars in  charitable  donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria), and the rest.Taken as a whole, this represents a level of corruption that would preclude anyone from running for office, let alone the US Presidency and yet, this issue receives very little airtime in the US. The reason for this is simple: both Democrats and Republicans are up to their neck in Washington s Dirty War on Syria. Illegal Gun-running Out of Benghazi, LibyaWhen the initial Benghazi story broke in the US, the media and the Republican politicians focused almost exclusively on the US casualties during militant raids on a CIA annex and makeshift US embassy in Benghazi. Four men died on September 11th and 12th, 2012   U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. Ten others were wounded in the fighting.During the aftermath, US media and GOP opposition made the story all about Hillary Clinton and the White House s  failure  to send reinforcements which they argue could have  saved American lives.   While this may have been true, it ignores the real story. This diversion was done in order to steer the narrative away from the bipartisan effort to traffic massive amounts of illegal weapons from Libya, and into the hands of US-NATO and Gulf-backed  rebels  in Syria.We now know that Clinton s diplomat Christopher Stevens was providing diplomatic cover for a CIA operation to transfer ex-Libyan military weapons stocks over to Syria. Many islamist fighters who fought with NATO to bring down Gaddafi in 2011 were later transferred from Libya to Syria to fight against the Syrian government.Still, despite all of this the collapse of Washington s puppet government the National Transitional Council (NTC), and Libya rapidly descending into a failed state, and the emergence of a new ISIS beach head there   Clinton s inner circle remained clueless and only seem to be concerned with promoting  HRC  credentials in advance of her presidential run. Gateway Pundit adds: Hillary s team provides Clinton credit for her many actions that led to Qadhafi s toppling in Libya including, but not limited to: suspending the operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington; evacuating US embassy personnel in Tripoli and closing the embassy there; obtaining sanctions against Qadhafi and his family; working to suspend Libya from the Human Rights Council; appointing Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S. representative to Benghazi; engaging with UAE, Qatar, and Jordan to seek their participation in coalition operations; holding meetings with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the Libya operation; and lastly, it was noted that Hillary worked to construct a $1.5 billion assets package to the National Transitional Council or NTC. Hillary saw this email sent to her from Cheryl Mills because as noted at WikiLeaks she asked for it to be printed in a subsequent email to a colleague. This email proves that Clinton s team created a list to show her responsibility for being the architect behind the overthrow of Qadhafi in Libya and the subsequent horror as a result. It is now known that the NTC in Libya is no longer in charge but it is unknown what happened to the $1.5 billion Hillary pushed to prop up this group. Here is the email via Scribd:NeoCon BedfellowsWith all the hysterical rhetoric by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party this year about  Russia Hacking the US Elections,  it should be pointed out that Clinton s State Department engineered a complete overthrow of a foreign government in Ukraine.There is also the case of the foul-mouthed Victoria Nuland (photo, left), Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs   appointed by Clinton and charged with organizing Washington s 2014 coup d etat in Kiev.Clinton s appointee Nuland absolutely key in destabilizing the Ukraine, a move which effectively ruined US-Russian relations, leading us right up to the present geopolitical confrontation over Syria.During the m l e Nuland was also caught on tape with US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, discussing which hand-pick Washington-approved people would be filling which positions in their new unelected junta government, including the office of Prime Minister. Listen to this stunning call: Award-winning journalist Robert Parry adds,  The fact is that Clinton has generally marched in lock step with the neocons as they have implemented an aggressive  regime change  strategy against governments and political movements that don t toe Washington s line or that deviate from Israel s goals in the Middle East. So she has backed coups, such as in Honduras (2009) and Ukraine (2014); invasions, such as Iraq (2003) and Libya (2011); and subversions such as Syria (from 2011 to the present) all with various degrees of disastrous results. The No Fly Zone FantasyAnother big problem is that Clinton sees her path to war in Syria through a No Fly Zone, to  Save the poor children of Aleppo. Although it sounds good during a TV debate, it is very unrealistic in practical terms, and if implemented, it would place the US squarely at war with both Russia and Syria, and possible Iran by extension. Is that the best Clinton has to offer?  Prof Michel Chossudovsky explains the fundamental flaw in Clinton s proclamation:At the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president, she would implement a no-fly-zone, intimating that the objective was to  save lives : I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general,  Clinton said in response to a question from Fox News debate moderator Chris Wallace. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the Russians and Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground   I think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in Syria.  (Fox News, emphasis added)At present, under the Obama administration, the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the  No Fly zone .The Joint Chiefs of Staff are appointed by the Secretary of Defense.Under a Clinton presidency, a new Secretary of Defense as well as a new Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, firmly committed to  A No fly Zone  over Syria would be appointed.Mich le Angelique Flournoy, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is Hillary s choice for the position of Secretary of Defense, who favors the  No Fly Zone  option. Most considerate and informed commentators now accept that a No Fly Zone is an act of war. Clinton of all people should know this after Libya.Loosening Legal Requirements for WarLast week, vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, said that if elected, Hillary Clinton would press lawmakers to rewrite the Sept. 14, 2001, Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)   making it even easier to  go to war  without having the actually declare war with a Congressional vote. This bill has been a favorite of Obama who has used it as an open-ended executive path to multiple undeclared wars of aggression, and to make his war on ISIS appear legal, for now anyway.According to Kaine, Clinton believes that,  it s time for us to take that now-outdated authorization, and really think about what we are confronting, and work together to reach some legislative-executive accord about what it is we re doing.  Kaine told Axelrod.  It s time for Congress to get back in the game and refine and revise that authorization. This is nothing more than another Washington lawyer s parlor trick   to pass another AUMF bill to cover the old one. The script just keeps getting revised.This was reiterated by Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Lehrich in July when he told Yahoo News that Clinton agrees with Senator Kaine that if we are serious about confronting ISIS, Congress ought to express its resolve to stand behind our military and win this fight by passing a new AUMF. The legislation reflected his national security aides  desire that it not tie his hands. The document authorized airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in the following three years. It forbade the use of American ground troops in  enduring offensive ground combat operations    a term the White House described as deliberately vague. It also allowed strikes against  individuals and organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIL  anywhere in the world.Democrats have balked at supporting such a sweeping measure. Republicans have pointed to the three-year limit and the ground-combat language to argue that the AUMF improperly binds the hands of Obama s successor.The truth of the matter is that both sides see political peril in the president s proposal. Democrats recall how voting in favor of the Iraq War helped to doom Clinton s 2008 presidential ambitions. And Republicans, who could vote to remove the language they describe as objectionable, prefer to criticize Obama s handling of the conflict without taking any steps that might make them co-owners of the strategy. A lawyer s blueprint for a continuation of Washington s status quo: unconstitutional open-ended, undeclared wars of aggression, anywhere, any time.A Threat to World PeaceLike Obama, and Bush before him, and Bill Clinton before them, as president Hillary Clinton will be expected to expedite an establishment agenda written by transnational corporations and other nebulous international crime syndicates. The financial engine for this is the banking houses of Wall Street and the City of London. A basic review of the Clinton s intimate relationship with Goldman Sachs investment house should provide amble proof of Bill and Hillary s ties to that circle. This shows how, throughout their career, the Clintons have been owned and operated by these banking houses.SEE ALSO: PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall StreetSuffice to say, based on this and many other exhibits which we have left out here, Hillary Clinton is a clear and present threat to world peace.This is not to say the Donald Trump presidency will be a halcyon affair either, but we don t know that yet. This is another problem with this heavily politicized topic in the US. In order to derail any critique of Clinton s chequered past, many Clinton supporters and die-hard liberal Democrats will try to equate to words of private citizen Donald Trump with the actions of public official Hillary Clinton. If we are having a rational argument then that would simply be a false comparison.If Donald Trump were to assume the office of Presidency, then I would not hesitate to apply as harsh an analysis to his actions and policies.In terms of foreign policy and government corruption   Trump is an unknown quantity, while Hillary Clinton is very well-known one, as we have demonstrated. We have already seen her handy work in both Libya and Syria. Likewise, we have seen the fruits of Bill Clinton s misadventures in Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo, not to mention his menacing economic sanctions in Iraq which killed upwards of 1 million Iraqi civilians over a ten-year period, and sowed the seeds for future wars.It should also be noted that Senator Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq War in 2003   a war waged on a false pretense,  although she now claims the war was a  mistake. After a joint US-Terrorist operation that ended in the assassination and street lynching of Libya leader Mumaur Gaddafi near the town of Sirte in October 2011, during a CBS interview, a gloating Hillary Clinton made one of the most callous and disturbing remarks ever from a high-ranking diplomat when she said: We came, we saw, he died!  and proceeded to laugh on camera.This clip really sums up the attitude and moral vacuum we might experience with a Clinton White House:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dmp3Jndj_o . The evidence really speaks for itself.

The same is true in politics, and even more so in this historic election season. As the polls closed yesterday, Republican candidate and US Senator Marco Rubio took to the podium to announce he was finally bowing out the GOP presidential primary race. Front runner Donald Trump nearly swept the board starting with Rubio s home state of Florida, followed by Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and in US territory Mariana Islands, while Ohio governor John Kasich took the remaining contest winning his first primary race ,in his home state.With 99 delegates at stake in a winner take all contest, Florida was meant to be Rubio s gallant last stand. Even though the polls showed Rubio trailing in double digits before Tuesday, Rubio still insisted he was going to win, and even go on to win the nomination.Marco: A smile you can trust.. Quite frankly, I think a lot of people are going to be embarrassed tonight and are going to want refunds from the money they spent on those polls because we re going to win Florida,  said Rubio.  We feel very optimistic about that. When it was all said and done, Trump beat Rubio 46% to 27% in Florida. A blow out.By the end of his long drive, Rubio had only managed to win one state caucus in Minnesota, leaving him with no real primary victory. To his investors, the truth of the  matter might be almost too painful to comprehend  that beyond all the hype, their man was really a bottom tier candidate.Super Tuesday s humiliating loss was indicative of a Rubio rise  that never rose. Before Tuesday s defeat, no matter how poorly Florida Senator Marco Rubio showed in previous primary elections, and no matter how badly he was polling in his home state of Florida   the media, led by CNN and FOX News, still covered his campaign like he was winning the election. Clearly, there was a concerted and well-coordinated effort by the Republican establishment and major broadcast media outlets to promote Rubio s candidacy well above the actual candidate s weight division.Three weeks ago, in a last-ditch effort to elevate his poll numbers, Rubio tried to out-Trump Trump, by unleashing his own round of back-ally personal verbal insults at the front runner in the hope of pulling The Donald back down to earth. Rubio began publicly calling Trump a  con man  and asserted that Trump had not achieved anything in his business career and along with fellow competitor Ted Cruz, inferred that the billionaire property and entertainment mogul Trump had inherited $200 million dollars from his late father and therefore was not deserving of any accolades. When Trump would joke about Rubio s lack of height (Rubio is 5 8  and Trump is 6 2 ), Rubio hit back joking,  look how small Donald s hands are, and you what they say about men with small hands..  to his crowds roaring with laughter before the Texas primary three weeks earlier.Trump finally hit back with a moniker that Rubio could never shake, renaming him  Little Marco.  LITTLE MARCO: Trump s crude deconstruction of Rubio delivered the final blow.Although their cage match pulled more TV airtime and attention away from a Trump-obsessed media, in the end it backfired horribly for Marco, as America got an uncomfortable snapshot of a nasty and desperate Rubio   hardly the look of stability, moderation and  unity that Rubio marketeers were trying to project, and hardly presidential either.What was most telling about Rubio s response to a situation, partly of his own making, was that Rubio shirked any responsibility for ratcheting-up the rhetoric, and instead tried to blame Trump for the degrading  tone  of the election: This is a frightening, grotesque and disturbing development in American politics,  Rubio said of the violence.  We are being ripped apart at the seams now,  he continued.  I m sad for this country. This is supposed to be the example to the world of how a republic functions and instead people are watching third-world images last night coming out of Chicago. It was too late. The damage was already done. Some pundits were calling it  political suicide  by Rubio   a gross error of political miscalculation on his part. But this would be missing the point because in reality, beyond all the incredible marketing hype, Rubio s campaign never achieved any serious market penetration to begin with.It s important to remember that the establishment firmly believed, and still to this day, that Marco Rubio could be the Republican Party s answer to the marketing sensation that was Barack Obama in 2008. By capitalizing on his youth and his Latino profile, the GOP elite saw this as a  turn-key  marketing solution. Just like a soda pop brand, party and media operatives believed that by positioning Rubio s brand in a highbrow market tier, voters would make the necessary connections and move to act by casting their vote for him. DETATCHED: Darryl Issa throws himself under the bus,, desperate to inflate Rubio before Super Tuesday.On Super Tuesday, the transmission truly fell out of the Rubio marketing machine. After months of boasting about how he would win his home state, Rubio plugger and California Congressman Darryl Issa (R), insisted that,  Marco is leading in early (voting) returns in Florida. Seriously, Congressman Issa?Issa appeared to be carrying water for the GOP establishment by doing the last minute media rounds for kingmaker Mitt Romney, who weeks earlier dropped the gauntlet down on the Trump train during a speech at the University of Utah. Romney,  a former Republican presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor implored his GOP herd to join forces and stop Trump by splitting the votes by voting for Kasich in Ohio, and for Rubio in Florida. Romney hoped  that his divide and conquer strategy would rob Trump of the delegate majority needed to secure the GOP nomination before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio this July. JET-SET: Rubio taking instructions from elite off-shoring corporate raider Mitt Romney.Clearly, Romney had staked his claim behind Marco Rubio then, which means that Rubio s collapse in Florida has half deflated Romney s Revolt.Romney continued to dig a hole for himself in Florida before Super Tuesday by recording an automated  Robo-call used to phone prospective Marco Rubio voters in Florida, nearly begging voters to cast ballots for,  a candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton and who can make us proud. The recorded message went on:  If we Republicans were to choose Donald Trump as our nominee, I believe that the prospects for a safe and prosperous future would be greatly diminished   and I m convinced Donald Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton. Making Robo-calls for a candidate who people were already calling  a Robot , wasn t exactly a smart move by Romney.Far from swinging the election towards Rubio, what Mitt Romney really proved was that money and power can t buy common sense.Ghost RunFor anyone who actually bothered to look close enough, hints of Rubio s collapse were everywhere, but you wouldn t know if from media coverage over the last two months. If not for favorable network face-time on the GOP TV debates, along with Rubio s elite financier backers like billionaire Paul Singer and Cayman hedge fund raider Romney, it s safe to say that Rubio s numbers might had been well below those of his fellow non-starter, Ohio Governor John Kasich.Rubio-linked multi-million dollar Super PAC funds pulled out all the stops against Trump too, launching a social media tidal wave of anti-Trump messages before the Florida primary:If every Rubio supporter makes 1 phone call #MarcoRubio will win! Convince 1 voter to vote for Marco! #CallForMarco pic.twitter.com/d8wOKZWFA4  Stop Trump PAC (@StopTrumpPAC) March 15, 2016Last Wednesday, Rubio hired out a football stadium to stage a homecoming rally in his own state. Unfortunately, no one showed up. TV cameras had to be moved forward into a tiny area around the field s goal posts in order to make the rally look as if more than a few hundred people bothered to show up. Far from jovial and inspirational, the atmosphere was that of deflation and despondency. It was tragic.Rubio stadium event in Hialeah. Stands empty; crowd in one end zone. pic.twitter.com/9zj0xslwSA  Byron York (@ByronYork) March 9, 2016 And when the cameras zoomed-in, it looked like this:The crowd in Hialeah is fired up for @marcorubio tonight! #FLforMarco #FLPrimary pic.twitter.com/e34GsoWWwH  Team Marco (@TeamMarco) March 9, 2016CNN had dispatched one of its intrepid city-dwelling reporters, Jason Carroll, out to Hialeah, Florida to  cover the event. Carrol tried be nice about it, describing the event as  much, much smaller  than a  normal  Rubio event. So much for Marco s homecoming, and so much for Mitt Romney s plan to have Marco win his home state to force a brokered convention in July.If Romney s revolt was ever going to happen, it wasn t going to be in Florida. You d think Mitt s people would ve figured that one out, but there you go (millions are beginning to understand now why Romney performed so poorly in the 2012 election).Jason Carol s cameraman delivered a dim shot of the rally. If there was a church BBQ down the road, it would have drawn a bigger crowd than this.After this debacle last week, Rubio still found the gumption to go on national TV and more or less instruct his supporters to cast their vote for John Kasich in the Ohio primary. Never before in modern American history have we seen presidential candidates instructing their supporters to vote against them in order to derail the party frontrunner in the hopes of triggering a brokered Republican National Convention in July.In reality, a brokered convention means that even if Donald Trump wins the popular votes and the collects the most delegates in the GOP primaries   the Republican Party will call for a vote on the convention floor asking for all delegates to vote again, which in this case would mean that if the combined delegates of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich exceeds that held by Donald Trump, then Trump would be dumped by his own party s establishment insiders at the convention  in favor of another yet to be determined party elite selection. Most likely this would be Mitt Romney s former running mate, House Speaker Paul Ryan, or one of the other three aforementioned candidates.Great on PaperBefore he was cast-off by the Tea Party purists in favor of Cruz, Rubio had positioned his brand as one of insurgency, but the crowd didn t buy it. So the brand was repositioned as a  safe  choice for voters.When the Rubio vs Trump m l e first started, I had said that this was the inevitable result of the Republican establishment who were,  going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be Marco Rubio, with Wisconsin s Scott Walker throwing early innings in the bull pen. Orthodox RNC thinking last spring believed that Rubio, with less than one term in Senate and no leadership experience, would somehow repeat the  Obama effect  of 2008, and finally usher their party into the 21st century. Things looked very different for Hillary last spring too, where she seemed invincible on the Democrat side as well as in national polling. On paper at least, it seems that Rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the GOP elite presiding over a party in decline and disarray   young (44 years old, although you d put him at a decade his junior), and even more importantly, Latino, giving the GOP a shot at pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment: Hispanic-American, independents and moderate Democrats. On paper this all makes perfect sense, but running for President in the United States of America isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper. Case and point: Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson and, of course, Donald Trump. It was a truly devastating moment for the Rubio campaign who had raised no less than $70 million so far as part of a desperate establishment bid to market the  Rubio brand . According to a chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Rubio has been  more hyped than Crystal Pepsi,  in reference to Pepsi s 1992 marketing flop. Sen. Rubio has been more hyped than Crystal Pepsi, but he has flopped even worse,  said Weaver last week. Even a well-conceived, high-financed marketing campaign won t work if people don t want to buy the product. That s the Rubio campaign s problem . Behind the nice packaging, voters are discovering there is little substance. Not surprisingly, I don t really like Crystal Pepsi. No one does. But everyone remembers when Coca Cola tried to inflate New Coke, Cherry Coke, and finally Coke Zero, before it completely flopped. Millions were wasted in vain, and it seems that the only people who really benefited from this exercise in hype were the advertising agencies and the production companies who produced them   and also the media networks who sold the ad space to Coca Cola.The same could be said with Rubio, and of course with Jeb Bush and a few others, although Rubio may still live to run another day. Coke didn t give up on Zero. Zero eventually became a Hero (well, according to Coca Cola, anyway) after years and years of marketing capital was invested into that product  which no one was really interested in to begin with.Billionaire Boys ClubBillionaires love to gamble, especially in politics   and they gambled heavily   and lost, on Marco Rubio. One might question the establishment s efficacy in leaving an invisible Rubio in a primary race where he s taking votes away from a more promising challenger in Texas Senator Rafael Edward (Ted) Cruz. Ditto with Kasich.Maybe it s the egos, or maybe Trump is actually pulling the master strings. Either way, the establishment s anti-Trump obsession is tearing the Republican Party apart.Just when you thought it couldn t get any more like a true life black comedy, all three desperate GOP challengers found themselves courting the endorsement of election dropout and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, on the Thursday before the CNN debate began.As sexy goes, this endorsement hardly registers outside of a few select country clubs. If it were an endorsement from 90 year old Barbara Bush then it might mean something.So poor was Jeb s showing in the primary contest   even after burning through over $100 million in campaign donations (he raised over $150 million) and received around 7% of the vote   it s difficult to see why anyone among Rubio, Cruz and Kasich would be offering a stump for Mr. Excitement, a  low energy  dynastic nonstarter.On balance, this endorsement would probably garner less votes than an endorsement from David Duke. Such is the bizarre and sideshow-like nature of this 2016 presidential election. A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY: Rubio uses Neocon s PNAC and  Israel-first old marketing slogan.Why the Elite Loved RubioLike his globalist colleague Kasich, and despite his evasive comments on the campaign trail, Rubio seems very committed to Wall Street and Bilderberg principles regarding corporate-brokered trade pacts like TPP, TTIP, GAT, and the WTO.On foreign policy, Rubio is a pro-war Republican, calling for regime change in Syria, and even made the incredible comment during one of the GOP s February debates that,  We didn t overthrow Gaddafi, the Libyan people did , having not realized that months of US air bombardment, as well as arming and working with Islamist militants on the ground is what toppled the Libyan state in 2011. Many of these same militants packed up and moved the roadshow to Syria in late 2011 and early 2012. The CIA were active and involved in the repatriation of fighters to Syria and the trafficking of weapons into Syria after the fall of Gaddafi. It would be shocking if Rubio wasn t aware of any of this, especially if he wants to be president of the United States.The other obvious, if not bizarre indicator that the globalists billionaire, military industrial class were firmly backing Rubio was hidden in plain sight. His campaign slogan was  A New American Century , and of course, the significance of this was completely lost on the mainstream media. It seemed that Rubio had stolen his campaign slogan from the likes of Donald Rumsfeld and John Bolton (and Jeb Bush, who also signed the PNAC pledge in 1998) whose neoconservative pro-war think tank, Project for A New American Century (PNAC) was arguably the architect of America s post-9/11 foreign policy. PNAC was also an extension of Israel s foreign policy too, which makes sense considering how aggressively Rubio advocates for Israeli interests.When you actually look at Rubio s record during his time in the Florida legislature, it does not paint a pretty picture at all.Without too much effort, any member of the media, including CNN s Don Lemon, Jake Tapper or Anderson Cooper, could find a substantial trail of dirt behind the young Senator   if only for the fact that Rubio s record seems to be off limits by the media and newspapers like the New York Times   all of whom are devoted to only running critical exposes on Donald Trump. Rubio s dubious track record of scandals and other pieces of corruption are well-known in his home state, but almost invisible nationally. Top of that list might be one David Rivera, a long-time political ally and close friend of Marco Rubio   who also happens to be under investigation by the FBI.That s only the beginning. One of the most telling scandals involved Rubio selling his home to a lobbyist, and getting way over the asking price. On The Issues reports: Rubio s personal finances were questioned because he made a $200,000 profit selling a house he owned to the mother of a chiropractor who was lobbying for a change in state insurance rules. Rubio had been a holdout, but removed a block on the measure shortly after the home sale and voted for it. Rubio was criticized for failing to disclose a home equity loan he received from US Century Bank, whose chairman, Sergio Pino, was a political supporter. The house had been appraised for $185,000, more than the purchase price just 37 days after he bought it. Rubio s staff said the value jumped because he d locked in a lower preconstruction price and made improvements. US Century Bank a large recipient of federal bank bailout money denied making a sweetheart deal. There are a number of other sketchy scandals linking Rubio to Florida s organized crime syndicates, ponzi schemes, including shady deals involving cash payouts and dodgy lobbyists, some of which can be read here. The mainstream media never challenged Rubio on any of these reports, so Rubio never had to defend against them.Then there s the business of Rubio s  sugar daddy , Jewish billionaire and Israeli luminary Norman Braman. Not only is Braman bank-rolling the Rubio political machine (in return for ?), but Brahman s  charity  foundation also employs Marco s wife Jeanette Rubio too. ON BOARD: Rubio with Israeli luminary Shimon Peres.  Brahman is also Rubio s entr e into the Israeli Lobby. It was Brahman who flew Marco and his family to Israel in 2010 to be inducted into the Israeli mind-set. This is also evident through Rubio s pro-Israeli rhetoric, where during one debate he proudly announced,  There can be NO negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians right now In another recent speech, Rubio took things a step further by insinuating that anyone who criticizes Israel is racist, insisting that, All of this anti-Israel action going on globally, it s anti-Semitism. He could easily be speaking as an Israeli envoy, speaking straight off of the lobby s talking script.That s just a snapshot of what sort of political animal Marco Rubio is   not unlike the rest of the pack, and perhaps a lot more shrewd, pushy and cunning than many others. You wouldn t expect anything less by anyone who believes that they deserve to be elected President of the United States having served less than one term in the US Senate at the age of 44.It s not certain yet whether or not Rubio will be able to retain his Florida US Senate seat after announcing he would be campaigning for president last year. Maybe a run for governor in Florida is in the cards.One thing is certain though, at his young age and with powerful backers like the Israeli Lobby   we have not seen the last of Marco Rubio. His talent and ability as a speaker and his potential for a broad-based appeal is undeniable and you can be certain he will remain a key tool for the establishment for many years to come.Just like Coke Zero, with enough marketing muscle and money injected into it, every brand can have a second life.Rubio will return.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",

                              "text": "Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire Hillary Clinton is the architect of US foreign policy failures in Libya and Syria.   We ve heard that statement many times over the course of this US election cycle, but exactly how much truth is there to it? After researching this issue, one quickly learns that it s not only true, it s an understatement. She wasn t just an architect, she was a chief instigator. Clinton s main source of resume credibility is her tenure as US Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013. During that time, Clinton resided over the planning and conception of two devastating conflicts, Libya and Syria. These two disasters will ultimately define both the Obama and Clinton legacies, and not for the reasons one might think. I would like to stress that the case being made here is not a political one, it is a moral and ethical inquiry into the actions and conduct of a public official.Before we get into Libya, which itself is a detailed and grave tale of nation building gone wrong, let s look closely at Syria   a conflict (not a Civil War) which has been dominating the international conversation for the last 4 years, but even more intensely in the last 18 months. Thus far, the results of US policy are abominable.What ownership does Clinton have over today s Syria? Today, the conflict is still being fuelled by tens of thousands of US and Gulf-backed militants, mostly of foreign origin, who comprise multiple Takfiri terrorist groups which the US insist calling  rebels.  This conclave includes the Islamic State (ISIS/Daesh), Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria), Arar al Sham, Nour al-din al-Zenki, Jaish al-Fatah (The Army of Conquest), along with many others. These armed groups are occupying strategic civilian areas throughout Syria, and it is a statement of fact that these terrorists are using civilian populations as human shields.A US-led  Coalition  is currently flying over Syria and Iraq, supposedly  fighting ISIS,  but is also coming dangerously close to conflict with both the Syrian and Russian militaries.Although this situation is now way beyond the pale, there was a time back in 2012 when a genuine diplomatic intervention could have helped to alter a fatal course of events.Hillary Clinton played a crucial role in initiating the current disaster.During a presidential primary debate in Milwaukee in February 2016, Clinton was quick to boast about her many  achievements  as Secretary of State, especially in Syria: You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. It s a nice statement, but like so many of Clinton s policy eulogies, it has no basis in reality.Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development Solutions, sets Clinton straight explaining, In 2012, Clinton was the obstacle, not the solution, to a ceasefire being negotiated by UN Special Envoy Kofi Annan. It was US intransigence   Clinton s intransigence   that led to the failure of Annan s peace efforts in the spring of 2012, a point well-known among diplomats. Despite Clinton s insinuation in the Milwaukee debate, there was (of course) no 2012 ceasefire, only escalating carnage. Clinton bears heavy responsibility for that carnage, which has by now displaced more than 10 million Syrians and left more than 250,000 dead. Clinton s job, like most US diplomats, was to uphold the public facade that Washington is engaging in its usual list of honorable pursuits like cease fires,  peace plans  and protecting human rights   while simultaneously helping to advance a covert agenda that achieves the exact opposite: destabilization, escalation of violence, flooding the region with weapons, and of course, working to overthrow the government of Syria. We want to pay special attention to the weapons trafficking part. Clinton was pivotal   not only in coordinating with the Gulf states, but also giving political legitimacy to arming the  moderate rebels  (now commonly recognized as terrorists).Although the initial effort to fuel the armed insurgency in Syria was organized through Libya under the office of Secretary Clinton (which we ll demonstrate below), later efforts were formalized through a series of large weapons shipments out of NATO countries like Croatia, and then through other US-sanctioned covert smuggling projects like Operation Timber Sycamore, where the CIA, with the approval of President Obama, organized weapons shipments into Syria via Turkey and Jordan, but with Saudi Arabia footing the bill for that clandestine operation. The New York Times confirmed certain details of this in January 2016: American officials have not disclosed the amount of the Saudi contribution, which is by far the largest from another nation to the program to arm the rebels against President Bashar al-Assad s military. But estimates have put the total cost of the arming and training effort at several billion dollars. Perhaps the most important aspect of this story is this: it is absolutely illegal under International Law for foreign nations to conspire and trafficking arms into a country with the intent to overthrow the government of a nation-state.Now that might be a cause for concern for those wanting to recognize the international rule of law, but the United States, the Obama and Clinton regime has done this without any compunction at all. History shows however, that such overt flouting of international law places the entire basis of the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations at risk. Beyond this, it is also a running violation of US law in terms of providing material support (weapons, cash, supplies, intelligence and logistical support, and even political backing) to internationally recognized terrorist organizations. On those two points alone, Hillary Clinton should be not only disqualified for public office in the US, but should also face another criminal indictment for her role, along with every other US public official involved in sanctioning these operations, including Barack Obama, Senator John McCain, and a number of other US officials like Mike Rogers, former Republican Congressman from Michigan and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee when Timber Sycamore began.  FRIENDS OF SYRIA  : Secretary Clinton with Saudi and Qatari government officials in 2012, conspiring to destroy Syria.From 2011, Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was effectively the public-facing CEO of the cynically titled,  Friends of Syria.  This was essentially a lobbying tour, bringing together NATO members, the Arab League and the  Syrian Opposition  all together to promote a policy of regime change for Syria. In reality, it was really a vehicle for raising money and planning for war. Here Clinton was flanked by her Saudi Arabian and Qatari donors to the Clinton Foundation, along with then UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, Turkey s prime minister, Recep Tayip Erdogan, a hand-picked puppet government-in-exile called the  Syrian National Council,  and other  stakeholders    all vying for a piece of Syria.Behind the pomp and circumstance, however, all parties were openly conspiring to arm militants for the purpose of upending the government in Damascus. Clinton effectively steered this process throughout her time in the cabinet   a destructive process which has led to the bloodbath we see today. To any rational observer, the whole enterprise would be viewed as a failure; in terms of human loss, the refugee crisis, sectarian violence, and breeding terrorism for the next 30 or 40 years   and yet, somehow Hillary Clinton is counting this as one of her  achievements.  Here, Sachs offers an accurate take on Clinton s abysmal legacy in Syria: .. she joined Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and right-wing Israelis to try to isolate, even defeat, Iran. In 2010, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria to attempt to wrest Syria from Iran s influence. Those talks failed. Then the CIA and Clinton pressed successfully for Plan B: to overthrow Assad.When the unrest of the Arab Spring broke out in early 2011, the CIA and the anti-Iran front of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey saw an opportunity to topple Assad quickly and thereby to gain a geopolitical victory. Clinton became the leading proponent of the CIA-led effort at Syrian regime change.In early 2011, Turkey and Saudi Arabia leveraged local protests against Assad to try to foment conditions for his ouster. By the spring of 2011, the CIA and the US allies were organizing an armed insurrection against the regime. On August 18, 2011, the US Government made public its position:  Assad must go. Since then and until the recent fragile UN Security Council accord, the US has refused to agree to any ceasefire unless Assad is first deposed. The US policy under Clinton and until recently has been: regime change first, ceasefire after. After all, it s only Syrians who are dying. Annan s peace efforts were sunk by the United States  unbending insistence that U.S.-led regime change must precede or at least accompany a ceasefire. As the Nation editors put it in August 2012:The US demand that Assad be removed and sanctions be imposed before negotiations could seriously begin, along with the refusal to include Iran in the process, doomed [Annan s] mission.Despite the billions spent on arming and training  rebels , the millions of refugees and the hundreds of thousands dead   Assad did not  go  as per the grand plan.Things continue to go septic. A recently released WikiLeaks email from a 2014 exchange between Clinton campaign chair, then White House advisor to President Obama, John Podesta, where the pair openly discuss common knowledge that the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS terrorists. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region,  Clinton wrote. This effort will be enhanced by the stepped up commitment in the [Kurdish Regional Government]. The Qataris and Saudis will be put in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure. In his recent interview with Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange explains an unsettling criminal connection between Clinton and her family foundation: All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some  rogue  princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS. Aside from verifying what many already suspected, this proves that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepted millions of dollars in  charitable  donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria), and the rest.Taken as a whole, this represents a level of corruption that would preclude anyone from running for office, let alone the US Presidency and yet, this issue receives very little airtime in the US. The reason for this is simple: both Democrats and Republicans are up to their neck in Washington s Dirty War on Syria. Illegal Gun-running Out of Benghazi, LibyaWhen the initial Benghazi story broke in the US, the media and the Republican politicians focused almost exclusively on the US casualties during militant raids on a CIA annex and makeshift US embassy in Benghazi. Four men died on September 11th and 12th, 2012   U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. Ten others were wounded in the fighting.During the aftermath, US media and GOP opposition made the story all about Hillary Clinton and the White House s  failure  to send reinforcements which they argue could have  saved American lives.   While this may have been true, it ignores the real story. This diversion was done in order to steer the narrative away from the bipartisan effort to traffic massive amounts of illegal weapons from Libya, and into the hands of US-NATO and Gulf-backed  rebels  in Syria.We now know that Clinton s diplomat Christopher Stevens was providing diplomatic cover for a CIA operation to transfer ex-Libyan military weapons stocks over to Syria. Many islamist fighters who fought with NATO to bring down Gaddafi in 2011 were later transferred from Libya to Syria to fight against the Syrian government.Still, despite all of this the collapse of Washington s puppet government the National Transitional Council (NTC), and Libya rapidly descending into a failed state, and the emergence of a new ISIS beach head there   Clinton s inner circle remained clueless and only seem to be concerned with promoting  HRC  credentials in advance of her presidential run. Gateway Pundit adds: Hillary s team provides Clinton credit for her many actions that led to Qadhafi s toppling in Libya including, but not limited to: suspending the operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington; evacuating US embassy personnel in Tripoli and closing the embassy there; obtaining sanctions against Qadhafi and his family; working to suspend Libya from the Human Rights Council; appointing Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S. representative to Benghazi; engaging with UAE, Qatar, and Jordan to seek their participation in coalition operations; holding meetings with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the Libya operation; and lastly, it was noted that Hillary worked to construct a $1.5 billion assets package to the National Transitional Council or NTC. Hillary saw this email sent to her from Cheryl Mills because as noted at WikiLeaks she asked for it to be printed in a subsequent email to a colleague. This email proves that Clinton s team created a list to show her responsibility for being the architect behind the overthrow of Qadhafi in Libya and the subsequent horror as a result. It is now known that the NTC in Libya is no longer in charge but it is unknown what happened to the $1.5 billion Hillary pushed to prop up this group. Here is the email via Scribd:NeoCon BedfellowsWith all the hysterical rhetoric by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party this year about  Russia Hacking the US Elections,  it should be pointed out that Clinton s State Department engineered a complete overthrow of a foreign government in Ukraine.There is also the case of the foul-mouthed Victoria Nuland (photo, left), Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs   appointed by Clinton and charged with organizing Washington s 2014 coup d etat in Kiev.Clinton s appointee Nuland absolutely key in destabilizing the Ukraine, a move which effectively ruined US-Russian relations, leading us right up to the present geopolitical confrontation over Syria.During the m l e Nuland was also caught on tape with US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, discussing which hand-pick Washington-approved people would be filling which positions in their new unelected junta government, including the office of Prime Minister. Listen to this stunning call: Award-winning journalist Robert Parry adds,  The fact is that Clinton has generally marched in lock step with the neocons as they have implemented an aggressive  regime change  strategy against governments and political movements that don t toe Washington s line or that deviate from Israel s goals in the Middle East. So she has backed coups, such as in Honduras (2009) and Ukraine (2014); invasions, such as Iraq (2003) and Libya (2011); and subversions such as Syria (from 2011 to the present) all with various degrees of disastrous results. The No Fly Zone FantasyAnother big problem is that Clinton sees her path to war in Syria through a No Fly Zone, to  Save the poor children of Aleppo. Although it sounds good during a TV debate, it is very unrealistic in practical terms, and if implemented, it would place the US squarely at war with both Russia and Syria, and possible Iran by extension. Is that the best Clinton has to offer?  Prof Michel Chossudovsky explains the fundamental flaw in Clinton s proclamation:At the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president, she would implement a no-fly-zone, intimating that the objective was to  save lives : I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general,  Clinton said in response to a question from Fox News debate moderator Chris Wallace. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the Russians and Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground   I think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in Syria.  (Fox News, emphasis added)At present, under the Obama administration, the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the  No Fly zone .The Joint Chiefs of Staff are appointed by the Secretary of Defense.Under a Clinton presidency, a new Secretary of Defense as well as a new Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, firmly committed to  A No fly Zone  over Syria would be appointed.Mich le Angelique Flournoy, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is Hillary s choice for the position of Secretary of Defense, who favors the  No Fly Zone  option. Most considerate and informed commentators now accept that a No Fly Zone is an act of war. Clinton of all people should know this after Libya.Loosening Legal Requirements for WarLast week, vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, said that if elected, Hillary Clinton would press lawmakers to rewrite the Sept. 14, 2001, Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)   making it even easier to  go to war  without having the actually declare war with a Congressional vote. This bill has been a favorite of Obama who has used it as an open-ended executive path to multiple undeclared wars of aggression, and to make his war on ISIS appear legal, for now anyway.According to Kaine, Clinton believes that,  it s time for us to take that now-outdated authorization, and really think about what we are confronting, and work together to reach some legislative-executive accord about what it is we re doing.  Kaine told Axelrod.  It s time for Congress to get back in the game and refine and revise that authorization. This is nothing more than another Washington lawyer s parlor trick   to pass another AUMF bill to cover the old one. The script just keeps getting revised.This was reiterated by Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Lehrich in July when he told Yahoo News that Clinton agrees with Senator Kaine that if we are serious about confronting ISIS, Congress ought to express its resolve to stand behind our military and win this fight by passing a new AUMF. The legislation reflected his national security aides  desire that it not tie his hands. The document authorized airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in the following three years. It forbade the use of American ground troops in  enduring offensive ground combat operations    a term the White House described as deliberately vague. It also allowed strikes against  individuals and organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIL  anywhere in the world.Democrats have balked at supporting such a sweeping measure. Republicans have pointed to the three-year limit and the ground-combat language to argue that the AUMF improperly binds the hands of Obama s successor.The truth of the matter is that both sides see political peril in the president s proposal. Democrats recall how voting in favor of the Iraq War helped to doom Clinton s 2008 presidential ambitions. And Republicans, who could vote to remove the language they describe as objectionable, prefer to criticize Obama s handling of the conflict without taking any steps that might make them co-owners of the strategy. A lawyer s blueprint for a continuation of Washington s status quo: unconstitutional open-ended, undeclared wars of aggression, anywhere, any time.A Threat to World PeaceLike Obama, and Bush before him, and Bill Clinton before them, as president Hillary Clinton will be expected to expedite an establishment agenda written by transnational corporations and other nebulous international crime syndicates. The financial engine for this is the banking houses of Wall Street and the City of London. A basic review of the Clinton s intimate relationship with Goldman Sachs investment house should provide amble proof of Bill and Hillary s ties to that circle. This shows how, throughout their career, the Clintons have been owned and operated by these banking houses.SEE ALSO: PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall StreetSuffice to say, based on this and many other exhibits which we have left out here, Hillary Clinton is a clear and present threat to world peace.This is not to say the Donald Trump presidency will be a halcyon affair either, but we don t know that yet. This is another problem with this heavily politicized topic in the US. In order to derail any critique of Clinton s chequered past, many Clinton supporters and die-hard liberal Democrats will try to equate to words of private citizen Donald Trump with the actions of public official Hillary Clinton. If we are having a rational argument then that would simply be a false comparison.If Donald Trump were to assume the office of Presidency, then I would not hesitate to apply as harsh an analysis to his actions and policies.In terms of foreign policy and government corruption   Trump is an unknown quantity, while Hillary Clinton is very well-known one, as we have demonstrated. We have already seen her handy work in both Libya and Syria. Likewise, we have seen the fruits of Bill Clinton s misadventures in Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo, not to mention his menacing economic sanctions in Iraq which killed upwards of 1 million Iraqi civilians over a ten-year period, and sowed the seeds for future wars.It should also be noted that Senator Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq War in 2003   a war waged on a false pretense,  although she now claims the war was a  mistake. After a joint US-Terrorist operation that ended in the assassination and street lynching of Libya leader Mumaur Gaddafi near the town of Sirte in October 2011, during a CBS interview, a gloating Hillary Clinton made one of the most callous and disturbing remarks ever from a high-ranking diplomat when she said: We came, we saw, he died!  and proceeded to laugh on camera.This clip really sums up the attitude and moral vacuum we might experience with a Clinton White House:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dmp3Jndj_o . The evidence really speaks for itself.

                              "text": "Adapted from the latest Radio Derb, available exclusively on VDARE.com  If you followed the recent hysteria about our cruelty to illegal alien children on non-Main Stream Media, you'll be familiar with the depth of nonsense and dishonesty behind it all.  You'll know that the policy causing all the shrieking and fainting has been in place for years, long before Donald Trump showed up. You'll have seen the old clips from not-that-many years ago of Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and both of the Clintons telling us what a great evil illegal immigration is and how we need to take a strong stand against it.  You've probably also heard the numbers. You know that of the 12,000 minors detained in the six weeks of our zero-tolerance policy, only 2,000 were actually with a person claiming to be a parent. That's seventeen percent. You probably suspect, as I and Attorney General Sessions do, that if DNA testing were to be applied, that percentage would drop into low single figures.  You likely know that Mexico, through which these Central American invaders passed, has a well-equipped U.S. embassy and nine, count 'em nine, consulates scattered across that country from Yucatan in the south to Tijuana in the north. Any Central American seeking asylum in the U.S.A. could apply at any of those places, without any fear of being separated from his children.  You probably also know that Mexico is a nation addled with criminality and corruption. Much of what happens there is dictated by crime syndicates who depend on smuggling narcotics into the U.S.A. Those syndicates obviously have a keen interest in keeping our Border Patrol busy with other matters\u2014like, for example, detaining and processing illegal border-crossers.  As of last Friday, you're probably acquainted with the backstory behind Time magazine's current cover picture of a weeping tot who, according to Time, had been ripped from her mother's arms.  The true story\u2014uncovered by the British press, of course, not by our own worthless hacks\u2014is that the child comes from a comfortable middle-class family in Honduras; that the child's mother long fantasized about living in the U.S.A.; and that she at last acted on her fantasy, paying six thousand dollars to people traffickers and heading north without telling her husband, who is left in Honduras with their other three children, aged fourteen to six.[ Honduran father reveals daughter was never separated from her mother, By Daniel Bates and Karen Ruiz , Daily Mail, June 23, 2018]  The husband tells us that to the best of his knowledge child and mother have not been separated \u2026 though child and father obviously have, by several hundred miles, at the mother's initiative.  This whole thing, this whole hysteria, is in other words bogus from top to bottom, just like all the other Progressive hysterias of recent years: Charlottesville, Russian election meddling, Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, the savage racism of asking for voter I.D. at polling stations.  If you pay any attention at all, if you care at all about actual facts, if you're willing to privilege\u2014pardon the word, please: it's the correct word\u2014if you're willing to privilege objective truth over your own surging emotions and personal resentments, you know that it's all one Big Lie.  It's a usual thing for people suspected of a crime to be detained by law enforcement. If they have kids, this perforce separates them from their kids, since no humane society wants kids placed in adult detention facilities.  That's been true in the case of U.S. citizens for ever. To say it should not pertain to non-citizens is to privilege\u2014again, that's the mot juste here\u2014to privilege foreigners over our own people. And foreigners have a straightforward way to avoid this particular peril: They can stay in their own countries.  \"But they're desperate!\" wail the hysterics. \"Their countries are so messed up! And it's OUR FAULT they're messed up!\"  The first thing to be said about that is, that a very great many countries are messed up. Billions\u2014that's \"billions\" with a \"b\"\u2014of people live in messed-up countries. A handful of outliers excepted, all countries are messed up except the few established and majority-populated by Ice People\u2014Europeans and East Asians.  Getting and keeping a not-messed-up country seems to be a difficult, an extraordinarily difficult achievement. Not even Ice People can always pull it off. For a non-messed-up country, iciness is necessary but not sufficient. Russia is quite badly messed up; so is China. Check out Albania. Check out North Korea. Being an Ice People country doesn't guarantee you're not messed up, nor vice versa, but that's the way to bet.  As for the notion of it being our fault that Central American countries are messed up, I don't buy it. For one thing, messed-up-ness is the normal state of affairs for countries not populated and run by Ice People, as just stated.  Take Latin America. It's hard not to notice that the general level of messed-upness down there is greatest where Ice People are least numerous. The southern \"cone\" countries\u2014Chile, Argentina, Uruguay\u2014with mostly Ice People populations, have their problems, no doubt; but none of them is Guatemala or El Salvador. They are the least messed-up Latin American countries.  How is that? Did we evil Gringos just forget to go and mess them up? Please.  I'm put in mind of the reply the Mexican made to the Texan when Tex asked why Mexicans are always so mad at the U.S.A. and blame us for everything. The Mexican's reply, according to P.J. O'Rourke: \"You stole half our country. And not only that, Se\u00f1or, you stole the half with all the paved roads.\"  And then, if your country messed up my country, why would I spend my family's savings and risk life and limb to break into your country, the great messer-upper?  One of the blessings of living in Central America is that if you are dissatisfied with your country, there are lots of countries close by you can flee to for refuge. A citizen of Honduras is closer to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Panama, Colombia, and the Bahamas than he is to the U.S.A., and not much further from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil.  Refuge-wise, he's spoiled for choice. Why would he want to come here, to the Great Satan, with all our cruelty and racism and xenophobia and white supremacy and toxic masculinity?  Mrs. Hernandez, the mother in the Time magazine cover story, doesn't seem at all mad about Uncle Sam messing up her country.  Listings of the Four Cardinal Virtues generally put prudence at number one.  In the realm of the National Question\u2014the question of what kind of nation we wish to be, and of what kind of nation we wish our children and grandchildren to inherit\u2014prudence is surely appropriate.  If getting and maintaining a non-messed-up country is as difficult at it seems to be, and as dependent as it seems to be on a healthy supermajority of Ice People, prudence consists in a strict attention to demographic stability and the avoidance of wild demographic experiments.  With all my heart, and with as loud a voice as I can raise, for the sake of my children and their children, I urge prudence upon our nation's leaders.  But what our nation's leaders are actually doing is \u2026 nothing much.  There are plain political reasons for this. Some of them, some of those reasons, have been the motivations behind this week's hysteria over illegal aliens. Others are more longstanding and baked-in to our system.  Our national legislature is quite finely balanced between the two big parties. The Senate is Republican by 51 percent; the House is Republican by 54 percent (55 percent if you factor in currently vacant seats). Under these circumstances, with midterm elections just twenty weeks away, both parties are of course strategizing like crazy.  The Democrats' strategy is to run out the clock: doing nothing either positive or negative while striving to make President Trump look as bad as possible in the eyes of their base\u2014GoodWhite ethnomasochists and racial minorities. The Main Stream Media are totally on board with this, and pushing the strategy for all they're worth.  That's what this week's hysteria has been about. Random comment from a random media shill, this one actually Charles Blow [Email him] at the New York Times June 17th:  Trump is lying, as he often does. This barbaric policy is an outgrowth of his own personal cruelty \u2026 This practice of family separation must end, and Trump and every other politician who was silent about it or worse, endorsed it, must be held to account at the ballot box.[Trump and the Baby Snatchers]  That puts it as plainly as you could want. Trump is an evil person! Vote Democrat!  Godwin's Law\u2014which states, just to remind you, that as an internet discussion thread grows longer, the probability of someone mentioning Hitler approaches certainty\u2014has been much in evidence in this week's hysteria: so much so, in fact, that even some of the Open-Borders people have felt moved to protest.  Here for example was John Podhoretz, an old-school Jewish immigration sentimentalist and race denialist:  Hitler wanted all Jews dead. Trump wants non-Americans who are here in violation of US law out of the United States. Dislike that all you wish. I do. I do not think this is the right policy. But it's not the systematic elimination of the Other. Stop cheapening the Holocaust to score political points, June 22, 2018  Which might be a bit more persuasive if Podhoretz had not himself done a bit of Holocaust-cheapening five months ago when he compared either Presidential advisor Stephen Miller or our own Steve Sailer\u2014it's not clear which\u2014to Joseph Goebbels.  Still, it's a sign of how crazy things have gotten that even Podhoretz, a neocon's neocon, thinks the Godwinization of our public discourse has gone too far.  That's congressional Democrats and their MSM shills. What about congressional Republicans?  Well, there have been signs of sentient life in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Goodlatte Bill was voted down on Thursday, but it got 193 GOP votes, that's 82 percent of the House Republicans who voted\u2014much better than forecast. Praise and blessings from Radio Derb to all 193 of those House Republicans; a pox on the 41 Republican Nays (except those who, like Rep. Steve King, were voting against the Amnesty provision that the bill was trying to trade for patriotic reforms).  Speaker Paul Ryan himself did not vote. This is customary and not at all remarkable.  Ryan does, however, seem to have taken that better-than-expected 193 vote count to heart. He's been working up a bill of his own, a much cuckier, more donor-friendly bill. He'd planned to bring his bill to a vote this week right after Goodlatte's, but that vote has now been postponed to next week so that Ryan can jiggle the bill a bit to make it more acceptable to the 193. [House Rejects Hard-Line Immigration Bill and Delays Vote on Compromise, By Thomas Kaplan and Nicholas Fandos, The New York Times, June 21, 2018]  There is very little prospect that Ryan's jiggling will make this second bill anything other than what it currently seems to be: a huge mass Amnesty for alien scofflaws garnished with some vague, easily-reversed promises on border security and internal enforcement. That's what GOP donors want, and that's what Ryan will give them. After all, six months from now he'll be working for them openly, full-time, as a lobbyist.  The Senate is as usual immigration-shy and effectively inert. Even if Ryan's bill passes the House, it will die in the Senate. Everybody, including Paul Ryan, knows this.  So it's all kabuki theater. Democrats want to go into the midterms saying to their base that the President is Hitler; Republicans want to go in saying to their base that, heck, we know you want something done and we tried to do something, we really did, but there are just too many darn Democrats in Congress to get anything through.  The actual mood of the Republican base seems to be strongly pro-enforcement, even after this MSM blizzard of stories about howling toddlers being ripped from their mothers' arms. The strong vote for the Goodlatte Bill reflects this: GOP congresscritters have been hearing from their constituents.  My own thumbnail gauge of GOP voter sentiment is, as I mentioned last week, the Letters columns of the New York Post, which I have reason to believe actually reflect the feelings of readers of this conventionally center-right newspaper in a not-very-Republican region.  The Post actually ran an editorial about border detentions as the hysteria got under way, taking quite a stern line against President Trump's policy. [Stop breaking up families at the border, June 17, 2018] I waited patiently to see what the Letters column showed.  That editorial ran on Sunday, June 17. Monday, June 18, nothing. Tuesday, June 19, seven letters. Five of the seven were hysterical. The words \"ripping,\" \"ripping,\" \"kidnapping,\" and \"ripped\" showed up in four of the five. Godwin's law of course kicked in, quote from a Manhattan letter-writer: \"I now feel like I'm living in Nazi Germany,\" That's from the heart of New York City, current mayor Comrade Bill \"Honeymoon in Castro's Cuba\" de Blasio.  Even then, though\u2014on Tuesday, as the hysteria was cresting\u2014two of the Post's seven reader letters were non-hysterical. One blamed the illegals for putting their children at risk. Another calmly suggested using FEMA facilities\u2014Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2014to house the detainees.  Friday the Post ran another batch of readers' letters, nine this time. Only one followed the hysterical line. Incredibly, it refrained from invoking Godwin's Law; but it did include the phrase, quote, \"ripped from their mothers' arms,\" The other eight wanted better border control and scoffed at the hysteria. Seven of the eight supported current policy. The eighth opposed it from the right, deploring, \"President Trump's executive order flip-flop,\u201d which the writer blamed on Ivanka and Melania.  I don't say this is definitive, certainly not any kind of scientific survey. Those letters do show, though, that even here in New York\u2014the beating heart of Left-liberal lunacy and Republican cuckery\u2014there are plenty of people not taken in by the hysteria.  I agree, by the way, with that eighth New York Post reader that Trump's Executive Order was a blunder. The policy that caused all the hysteria\u2014separating kids from their parents or pretend-parents and keeping them in HHS facilities for a few days\u2014was perfectly legal, defensible, and humane. What's supposed to happen now? We put the kids in Border Patrol lock-ups? How is that better?  The logic is inescapable. An adult who crosses the border without authorization is liable to arrest and detention, quite rightly so. If there are children with him, those children need to be detained and cared for, too; though since it's the adult who broke the law, not the child, this is a child-care issue, not a law-enforcement issue.  If child-care detention in HHS facilities is unacceptable, and detention of children in Border Patrol lockups with their parents is unthinkable, the only possibility is to let the kids go. So thousands of children\u2014including a lot of teenagers and likely some adults posing as teenagers \u2014with no proper claim to U.S. residence, have gotten it. And when the accompanying adult really is the child's parent, they'll get to stay too.[\u2018Unaccompanied Migrant CHILDREN\u2019 Arrive at NY Airport -Appear to be GROWN MEN With SCRUFFY BEARDS and Shaving Kits (VIDEO), Gateway Pundit, June 23, 2018]  Our courts will make sure of that. Our courts are in fact a big part of the problem. Michelle Malkin many years ago stated the Prime Directive of immigration jurisprudence: \"It ain't over until the alien wins.\" That will probably be the governing factor in the fate of these Central American border-jumpers going forward.  A friend who knows much more about our laws and Constitution than I do tells me that Congress could in fact bar the federal judiciary from considering these cases.  That's nice, supposing my friend is right and I've understood him correctly; but the chance of Congress actually doing anything that imaginative, or that patriotic, is so small you'd need an electron microscope to see it. So this idea is like\u2014to leap to the other end of the cosmic scale\u2014is like the Heat Death of the Universe: kind of interesting, but not actually relevant to anything likely to happen in our lives.  The President could anyway have spared himself all the wrangling his administration's in for with the judiciary, and could also have spared us this last few day's screeching hysteria, by just doing what he was elected to do: build an effective border barrier.  It's not that hard. Israel's done it; Hungary's done it; Saudi Arabia and India have done it. China did it two thousand years ago.  What, you want to tell me we can't do it until Congress appropriates the funds? I don't believe it. I understand about checks and balances, but the President doesn't have that little power. If we can bomb wedding parties in Afghanistan without a Congressional declaration of war, surely we can put up a decent border barrier.  This has been Trump's greatest failure. Those of who voted for him, campaigned for him, and turned out on freezing winter mornings to show our support for him, need to keep telling him this.  Build the damn wall, Mr. President!

                              "text": "Posted on October 28, 2016 Media Self-Destruct over Trump Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, October 28, 2016 Their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired. \nFrom the start of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, the media have covered him dishonestly. They have consistently portrayed him as a closet \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d who deliberately appeals to \u201cracists.\u201d They have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the \u201cAlt-Right.\u201d They are now working on another dishonest angle: that Donald Trump is \u201cmainstreaming hate\u201d and bringing \u201cracism\u201d into public discourse. The media clearly want to stampede voters into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s camp so as to spare us the agony of a \u201cracist\u201d in the White House. \nThe demonization campaign has backfired. By trying to hang racial dissidents around Donald Trump\u2019s neck, the media have given American Renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before. At the same time, constant shouts of \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cbigot\u201d don\u2019t seem to hurt Mr. Trump: instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility. The biggest irony, though, is that Donald Trump is probably not one of us at all. But even small deviations from the cast-iron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about Donald Trump as a secret David Duke fan. \nMedia dishonesty started immediately. When Mr. Trump pointed out that some immigrants from Mexico were criminals, the press acted as if he had said all Mexican immigrants are criminals. Then, when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call \u201chaters\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d liked Mr. Trump, there was no end of articles with titles such as: \u201c Meet the Horde of Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders Endorsing Donald Trump ,\u201d \u201c Top Racists And Neo-Nazis Back Donald Trump ,\u201d \u201c \u2018Heil Donald Trump\u2019: Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists Show Support ,\u201d and \u201c The White Nationalists Who Support Donald Trump .\u201d \nThese articles had a simpleminded purpose: discredit Mr. Trump by parading before the reader any Nazi, Kluxer, or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate. The implication was that if \u201cracists\u201d were going to vote for Donald Trump he must be \u201cracist,\u201d too. \nThis was deceitful and one-sided. When the chairman of the American Communist Party endorsed Hillary Clinton , no one suggested this meant she was a communist. \nIt is true that Mr. Trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet \u201cbigot\u201d because he did not repudiate \u201cracists\u201d with the snorts of indignation respectability requires. There was the famous exchange in February when a reporter pushed Mr. Trump to disavow an endorsement from David Duke. As The Hill reported it: \u201c \u2018David Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK?\u2019 Trump said, seeking to quickly move on to another question.\u201d \nThat same month, there was another famous exchange with Jake Tapper of CNN : \nTapper : Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don\u2019t want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election? \nDonald Trump : Well just so you understand, I don\u2019t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, did he endorse me, or what\u2019s going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. \nThe media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy. \u201cTrump refuses to disavow white supremacists! That\u2019s because he is one!\u201d \nThere are far better explanations. First, Donald Trump is a pugnacious man. He doesn\u2019t like being pushed around by anyone, especially not by journalists who hate him. If Mr. Tapper had belligerently demanded that Mr. Trump agree that the sky is blue, Mr. Trump would have bridled at that. \nSecond, Donald Trump probably doesn\u2019t know anything about David Duke or white supremacy. I would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of David Duke or any other alleged \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d It is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers, not some carefully concealed racial consciousness. \nThe press has also pounced on Donald Trump\u2019s retweets of \u201cracist\u201d material, which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist. Business Insider, for example, published this shocking story: \u201c 5 times Donald Trump has engaged with alt-right racists on Twitter .\u201d Not one of these tweets is obviously \u201cracist,\u201d and it would be surprising if Mr. Trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets @realDonaldTrump has sent during the campaign. \nNow the press is working on another smear-Trump angle. Recently, I have been contacted by journalists from such places as Bloomberg News, Reuters, and the New York Times , who clearly want to write that Donald Trump is \u201cmainstreaming hate,\u201d that he is responsible for a huge surge in the Alt-Right. They want to know about all the people who have been flocking to AmRen.com because of what Donald Trump says. They want me to tell them about people who have been \u201cemboldened\u201d to \u201cspeak out against minorities\u201d because Donald Trump has led the way. They would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting \u201cnigger!\u201d because Mr. Trump wants to take a hard look at Muslim immigrants. \nI have explained to them as patiently as I can that they have it the wrong way around. No one comes looking for AmRen.com because Donald Trump wants to build a wall. They come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that Mr. Trump is a \u201cracist.\u201d They come looking for us because Mrs. Clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the Alt-Right and her \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d I also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold Donald Trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him, few people would have heard of the Alt-Right. In their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors, they are promoting the Alt-Right, not Donald Trump. \nI explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before, for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign. It is Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Black Lives Matters, and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way\u2013 not Donald Trump. This will not change whether Mr. Trump wins or loses. The top landing pages on AmRen.com are analyses of race and crime\u2013something Mr. Trump never talks about. \nI also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think Mr. Trump has mainstreamed \u201chate,\u201d by which they mean sensible observations about race. I ask them to name a single person who has been \u201cemboldened\u201d to say something \u201cracist\u201d just because Donald Trump is the GOP nominee. Of course, they can\u2019t. If anything, it is the opposite. Mr. Trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest, most common-sense observations about Muslims and immigration. Anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever. Things could change if Mr. Trump becomes president, but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas. \nWhat Donald Trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that Mitt Romney and John McCain are no different from Barack Obama when it comes to preserving whites, their society, and their culture. I know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in November. I know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the Trump campaign. \nI point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about: giving the voters real choices. I note that the Trump/Clinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election. Haven\u2019t our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement, especially among the young? Well, now they have engagement, alright, but they don\u2019t like it. They don\u2019t like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a \u201c threat to democracy .\u201d Liberals are such transparent hypocrites. They claim to love democracy, but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to. \nThe whole Trump-is-a-racist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become. I may be wrong, but I have no reason to think Donald Trump thinks at all as we do. He has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary American with normal instincts: He doesn\u2019t want criminals sneaking across the border, he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy, he doesn\u2019t see why we need more Muslims, and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare. Millions of ordinary Americans clearly agree with him, and not because they are racially aware. It is because they are decent, fair-minded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways. \nI am convinced that Mr. Trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race. So far as I can tell, he doesn\u2019t have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything. He has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time, but not because he is one of us. \nMaybe\u2013just maybe\u2013he will move in our direction. It\u2019s not impossible to imagine a President Trump asking, in an offhand way, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the United States?\u201d Or he might casually note that you can\u2019t expect as many blacks as Asians in AP classes because they don\u2019t have the same levels of intelligence. But I can imagine the opposite, too: President Trump so bogged down in Beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall. \nThere is one thing that Donald Trump has changed. He has proven that Republican bromides about taxes and small government don\u2019t excite people. He has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties. He has proven that Americans do want their country to come first. They don\u2019t want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries. \nAnd even if he has not \u201cmainstreamed racism,\u201d he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an American. On October 11, Roger Cohen wrote in the New York Times that Donald Trump is a \u201cphony, liar, blowhard, cheat, bully, misogynist, demagogue, predator, bigot, bore, egomaniac, racist, sexist, sociopath,\u201d and a \u201cdictator-in-waiting with a brat\u2019s temper and a prig\u2019s scowl.\u201d This must be one of the most unhinged, hysterical outbursts in the history of American political journalism. And it is unusual only for its wordiness, not its tone. \nDon\u2019t the editors of the Times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more Americans believe in Bigfoot (29 percent) than trust newspapers (20 percent)? Virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at Donald Trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself. Open, petulant bias is driving more and more Americans to social media and to sites like AmRen.com for their news. \nDespite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire American ruling class, Donald Trump is going to get close to half of the vote on November 8. Some 60 million people are going to vote for a man for whom Roger Cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult. Only one major newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump. Only one . And this is a man whom the American people might choose as their president. What better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion, between what Americans think and what our rulers want us to think? Donald Trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity. \nWhether he wins or not, whether he is one of us or not, Donald Trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors. Voters\u2013finally\u2013have a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system. On November 8th they could bring it crashing down, but even if it still stands, it is visibly weakened, badly discredited. These are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before.",

                              "text": "Like nearly every issue of political importance to Americans, the problem of illegal immigration has been buried under such a load of histrionic horse manure that what isn\u2019t all that complicated a question is now harder to solve than the Riemann Hypothesis. Thanks to a series of inexplicable policy directions and legal decisions dating back to the 1997 settlement in the case of Flores v. Reno, itself a continuation of Flores v. Meese, we have managed to tie ourselves in a Gordian knot over the question of how to untangle the law on immigration.  According to the supporters of immigration policy that would throw open the doors to every Tomas, Ricardo and Jorge who manages to sneak across our southern frontier, President Donald Trump is meeting potential immigrants at the border and literally tearing their children from their arms. The darling little moppets are then warehoused in cages like stray dogs. No one knows what happens to the kiddies next, but their fates probably involve either slavery, forced medical experimentation or outright murder in one of the concentration camps set up under the Trump regime. It\u2019s only thanks to the tireless efforts of Hollywood actresses, television comedians and other liberal activists that anyone even learned of Trump\u2019s twisted machinations. As for their parents, they\u2019re either summarily executed out back or stuffed into railroad cars and shipped off to fates often worse than death.  Of course, like every narrative constructed by the Left, all of that is ridiculous. In accordance with federal law, anyone caught trying to sneak across the border is charged with unlawful entry. If they dragged their kids into their ill-fated caper, the government, thanks to Flores, has no real choice other than to shuttle the kids to a detention center. The people shrieking about \u201cconcentration camps\u201d are essentially arguing for sending children to adult jails. Since some of the people in those facilities are fun guys like MS-13 narcoterrorists, the separations are the most humane approach available.  Furthermore, none of this would have been necessary if the parents hadn\u2019t dragged their kids into journeys which are as fraught with peril as wearing a MAGA hat in Detroit and as well planned as \u2014 well \u2014 also Detroit. The \u201cconcentration camp\u201d rhetoric ignores the fact that the Jews didn\u2019t deliver their children to Auschwitz. Moreover, faked and/or incorrectly cited pictures notwithstanding, the facilities to which illegal aliens\u2019 children are sent are hardly the animal control-style kennels the pro-amnesty forces would have you believe.  Parents who deliberately put their children in harm\u2019s way are bad parents. If they wish to escape their current circumstances, the United States graciously offers a program under which people have regularly dived into our melting pot for a long time. It\u2019s worth noting that the so-called \u201cfamily separations\u201d about which the open borders crowd don\u2019t happen to immigrants who follow established, legal, procedures and present themselves to U.S. authorities, rather than dash through the desert in the dark.  No one outside Planned Parenthood enjoys separating kids from their parents. But the guilt lies with the parents who risk their children and the people in this country who encourage them to try. Those who lure people into breaking the law, only to turn their kids into supporting characters in their shrieking tableaus are not only cravenly exploiting children, they\u2019re putting Trump and the immigration enforcement authorities squarely in God\u2019s little acre. Offering only the alternatives of closing the borders entirely or giving up having borders entirely puts not only Trump and the authorities, but all of us, east of the rock and west of the hard place.  Unfortunately, thanks to the usual muddying of the issue by liberals who would rather exploit easy headlines and the leftist culture of perpetual \u2014 albeit, misinformed \u2014 outrage, the simple issue of border control is buried in the muck. By the time we dig it out, we\u2019ll be nothing more than a buffer zone between Canada and Mexico.  \u2014 Ben Crystal",

Personal Liberty Digest\u00ae presents: The WIRE!  President Donald Trump suffered through what may have been his worst week in the White House when his former minions Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort both hit the wall over tax and financial crimes. Of course, liberals immediately began shrieking about impeachment, as if being a pig who associates with other pigs is an impeachable offense.    \u201cImpeachable? Sure. Convictable? We sure hope not.\u201d  Cohen arranged a hush money payment he didn\u2019t make. Manafort got popped for crimes he committed while Mueller was director of the FBI and Obama was president. How is this going to end the Trump presidency, exactly?    Details are only important to MAGA rubes.  Trump crony David Pecker of tabloid publisher American Media International has reportedly received immunity in return for information he provided to investigators looking into the Michael Cohen case.    How is anyone surprised that a story involving porn stars and playmates also involved a Pecker?  With Manafort and Cohen going down, and Pecker getting immunity, President Trump \u2014 as usual \u2014 took to Twitter to vent his frustration over \u201cflipping,\u201d which he called \u201cunfair.\u201d    Little snitches get bigly stitches.  While liberals cheered the Cohen and Manafort cases as \u201cproof\u201d that Trump is dirty, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that two years of special counseling, and still no Russian collusion, just Trump acting like Bill Clinton. In the interest of fairness, Trump should have to marry Hillary.    He would resign tomorrow.  Even if they manage to impeach Trump, getting 2/3 of the Senate to vote to convict is more of an uphill battle than getting Nana Hilldawg elected. And even if that works out, guess what happens next? Say hello to President Pence.    Didn\u2019t think this one all the way through, did ya, Dems?  Speaking of illegal campaign contributions, given her campaign\u2019s unprecedented violations of campaign finance laws, it\u2019s a damned good thing for Nana Hilldawg that she lost.    It would be plain old weird if she wore her prison jumpsuit in the Oval Office.  Of course, no one seems to notice that paying hush money to a girlfriend may not be an illegal campaign contribution \u2014 or even illegal. But hey, good luck proving it.    Ought to be wrapping up that investigation by the time Ivanka is sworn in for her second term.  Anyone else notice that the \u201cresistance\u201d seems kinda overwrought about throwing Trump out of office? Almost like they still don\u2019t have someone to beat him in 2020.    There\u2019s always \u2014 never mind.  Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions got into it again this week with Trump complaining about Sessions\u2019 lack of control over the Department of Justice and Sessions proclaiming the DoJ wouldn\u2019t be improperly influenced.    One more public spat like this and they\u2019re not going to the prom together.  Liberals were quick to voice their outrage over the murder of Mollie Tibbetts by an illegal alien, whining about pro-border security people \u201cpoliticizing\u201d Tibbetts\u2019 murder. Right\u2026 because politicizing tragedy is wrong.    Up next on CNN: a town hall blaming the NRA for Parkland.  When Senator Elizabeth Warren sees the murder of Mollie Tibbetts, she sees what she calls \u201cthe REAL problem\u201d: so-called \u201cfamily separations\u201d at the U.S. border with Mexico.    Sorry Mollie, Lieawatha says you\u2019re \u201cfake news.\u201d  Liberals ratcheted up the outrage when an illegal alien was grabbed by ICE while taking his wife to the hospital for a c-section. None seemed interested in why ICE arrested the guy who was wanted for skipping out on a warrant for murder.    As we learned from their Tibbetts reactions, illegal aliens\u2019 comfort > human life.  The \u201cresistance\u201d cheered as multiple Democrat Senators have refused to meet with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as if refusing to meet with a guy they already promised to no-vote is brave or noteworthy.    It\u2019s gonna be super awkward when Justice Kavanaugh sits down in front of them at the next State of the Union.  It\u2019s worth noting that the Democrats wouldn\u2019t be throwing such an impotent tantrum if they hadn\u2019t rigged the nomination process themselves.    That high horse looks an awful lot like a petard.  Nana ain\u2019t going away quietly. The 2016 loser announced that she\u2019ll be headlining Democrat fundraisers in Chicago, New York and San Francisco this fall. (But probably not Wisconsin.)    With polls uncertain, Hillary will do her part to boost Republican fortunes in time for midterms.  Hillary isn\u2019t the only Clinton planning to \u201chelp\u201d the Democrats. Chelsea Clinton is saying she\u2019s considering a run for office. Democrats have Clintons like locker rooms have shower mold.    Chelsea 2032: Hey! What\u2019s That Smell?  Disgraced former intelligence analyst Reality Winner was sentenced this week to five years in prison for stealing classified information and mailing it to a media outlet; which serves to remind us all: If you\u2019re gonna leak classified intel, do it from the server in your bathroom.    It makes a big difference.  Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has had enough of the Trump show, whining about Republican refusal to betray the president and claiming the GOP mantra should be \u201cput your head in the sand.\u201d    It\u2019s catchy, but I like the Democrats\u2019 mantra better: \u201cLose.\u201d  And that\u2019s your week in review! For the Personal Liberty Digest\u00ae, I\u2019m Ben Crystal saying, \u201cSee you next week, on The WIRE!\u201d",

The media clearly want to stampede voters into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s camp so as to spare us the agony of a \u201cracist\u201d in the White House. The demonization campaign has backfired. By trying to hang racial dissidents around Donald Trump\u2019s neck , the media have given American Renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before. At the same time, c onstant shouts of \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cbigot\u201d don\u2019t seem to hurt Mr. Trump: instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility. The biggest irony, though, is that Donald Trump is probably not one of us at all. But even small deviations from the cast-iron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about Donald Trump as a secret David Duke fan. Media dishonesty started immediately. When Mr. Trump pointed out that some immigrants from Mexico were criminals , the press acted as if he had said all Mexican immigrants are criminals. Then, when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call \u201chaters\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d liked Mr. Trump, there was no end of articles with titles such as : \u201c Meet the Horde of Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders Endorsing Donald Trump ,\u201d \u201c Top Racists And Neo-Nazis Back Donald Trump ,\u201d \u201c \u2018Heil Donald Trump\u2019: Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists Show Support ,\u201d and \u201c The White Nationalists Who Support Donald Trump .\u201d These articles had a simpleminded purpose: discredit Mr. Trump by parading before the reader any Nazi, Kluxer, or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate. The implication was that if \u201cracists\u201d were going to vote for Donald Trump he must be \u201cracist,\u201d too . This was deceitful and one-sided. When the chairman of the American Communist Party endorsed Hillary Clinton , no one suggested this meant she was a communist . It is true that Mr. Trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet \u201cbigot\u201d because he did not repudiate \u201cracists\u201d with the snorts of indignation respectability requires. There was the famous exchange in February when a reporter pushed Mr. Trump to disavow an endorsement from David Duke. As The Hill reported it: \u201c \u2018David Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK?\u2019 Trump said, seeking to quickly move on to another question.\u201d That same month, there was another famous exchange with Jake Tapper of CNN : Tapper: Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don\u2019t want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election? Donald Trump: Well just so you understand, I don\u2019t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, did he endorse me, or what\u2019s going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. The media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy . \u201cTrump refuses to disavow white supremacists! That\u2019s because he is one!\u201d There are far better explanations. First, Donald Trump is a pugnacious man. He doesn\u2019t like being pushed around by anyone, especially not by journalists who hate him . If Mr. Tapper had belligerently demanded that Mr. Trump agree that the sky is blue, Mr. Trump would have bridled at that. Second, Donald Trump probably doesn\u2019t know anything about David Duke or white supremacy. I would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of David Duke or any other alleged \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d It is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers, not some carefully concealed racial consciousness. The press has also pounced on Donald Trump\u2019s retweets of \u201cracist\u201d material, which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist. Business Insider, for example, published this shocking story: \u201c 5 times Donald Trump has engaged with alt-right racists on Twitter .\u201d Not one of these tweets is obviously \u201cracist,\u201d and it would be surprising if Mr. Trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets @realDonaldTrump has sent during the campaign. Now the press is working on another smear-Trump angle. Recently, I have been contacted by journalists from such places as Bloomberg News, Reuters, and the New York Times , who clearly want to write that Donald Trump is \u201c mainstreaming hate ,\u201d that he is responsible for a huge surge in the Alt-Right. They want to know about all the people who have been flocking to AmRen.com because of what Donald Trump says. They want me to tell them about people who have been \u201cemboldened\u201d to \u201cspeak out against minorities\u201d because Donald Trump has led the way. They would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting \u201cnigger!\u201d because Mr. Trump wants to take a hard look at Muslim immigrants . I have explained to them as patiently as I can that they have it the wrong way around. No one comes looking for AmRen.com because Donald Trump wants to build a wall. They come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that Mr. Trump is a \u201cracist.\u201d They come looking for us because Mrs. Clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the Alt-Right and her \u201c basket of deplorables .\u201d I also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold Donald Trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him, few people would have heard of the Alt-Right. In their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors, they are promoting the Alt-Right, not Donald Trump. Rioting in Ferguson after Michael Brown was shot dead. Click to enlarge I explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before, for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign. It is Trayvon Martin , Michael Brown , Black Lives Matter , and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way\u2013 not Donald Trump. This will not change whether Mr. Trump wins or loses. The top landing pages on AmRen.com are analyses of race and crime\u2013something Mr. Trump never talks about. I also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think Mr. Trump has mainstreamed \u201chate,\u201d by which they mean sensible observations about race. I ask them to name a single person who has been \u201cemboldened\u201d to say something \u201cracist\u201d just because Donald Trump is the GOP nominee. Of course, they can\u2019t. If anything, it is the opposite. Mr. Trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest, most common-sense observations about Muslims and immigration. Anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever. Things could change if Mr. Trump becomes president, but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas. What Donald Trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that Mitt Romney and John McCain are no different from Barack Obama when it comes to preserving whites, their society, and their culture. I know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in November. I know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the Trump campaign. I point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about: giving the voters real choices. I note that the Trump/Clinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election. Haven\u2019t our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement, especially among the young? Well, now they have engagement, alright, but they don\u2019t like it. They don\u2019t like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a \u201c threat to democracy .\u201d Liberals are such transparent hypocrites. They claim to love democracy, but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to. The whole Trump-is-a-racist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become. I may be wrong, but I have no reason to think Donald Trump thinks at all as we do. He has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary American with normal instincts: He doesn\u2019t want criminals sneaking across the border, he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy, he doesn\u2019t see why we need more Muslims, and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare. Millions of ordinary Americans clearly agree with him, and not because they are racially aware. It is because they are decent, fair-minded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways. I am convinced that Mr. Trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race. So far as I can tell, he doesn\u2019t have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything. He has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time, but not because he is one of us. Maybe\u2013just maybe\u2013he will move in our direction. It\u2019s not impossible to imagine a President Trump asking, in an offhand way, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the United States?\u201d Or he might casually note that you can\u2019t expect as many blacks as Asians in AP classes because they don\u2019t have the same levels of intelligence . But I can imagine the opposite, too: President Trump so bogged down in Beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall. There is one thing that Donald Trump has changed. He has proven that Republican bromides about taxes and small government don\u2019t excite people. He has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties. He has proven that Americans do want their country to come first. They don\u2019t want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries. And even if he has not \u201cmainstreamed racism,\u201d he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an American. On October 11, Roger Cohen wrote in the New York Times that Donald Trump is a \u201cphony, liar, blowhard, cheat, bully, misogynist, demagogue, predator, bigot, bore, egomaniac, racist, sexist, sociopath,\u201d and a \u201cdictator-in-waiting with a brat\u2019s temper and a prig\u2019s scowl.\u201d [ Trumpism After Trump ] This must be one of the most unhinged, hysterical outbursts in the history of American political journalism. And it is unusual only for its wordiness, not its tone. Don\u2019t the editors of the Times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more Americans believe in Bigfoot (29 percent) than trust newspapers (20 percent)? Virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at Donald Trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself. Open, petulant bias is driving more and more Americans to social media and to sites like AmRen.com for their news. Despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire American ruling class, Donald Trump is going to get close to half of the vote on November 8. Some 60 million people are going to vote for a man for whom Roger Cohen [] has emptied his dictionary trying to insult. Only one major newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump. Only one . And this is a man whom the American people might choose as their president. What better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion, between what Americans think and what our rulers want us to think? Donald Trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity. Whether he wins or not, whether he is one of us or not, Donald Trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors. Voters\u2013finally\u2013have a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system. On November 8th they could bring it crashing down, but even if it still stands, it is visibly weakened, badly discredited. These are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before.

As I've had nothing. I'll Maki. This move it to give Glenn you gotta stay positive and suitcase bombs and is. This is a ceremony and we have to protect what we have here and that's our prayer. And this is one thing that. Can't stop. For months standing rock Sioux and their allies have camped out. On the banks of the Campbell River in North Dakota. Their mission. To stop the Dakota access pipelines. A three point seven billion dollar project slated to deliver crude oil from North Dakota to southern Illinois. The proposed route comes within 15100 feet for the current standing rock reservation and the tribe. Here's the pipeline will contaminate it's drinking water and destroy its sacred sites. It's a cause that's drawn the support of thousands from across the globe. But at the heart of it all there's a little known group of indigenous youth who was helped steer the movement from the very beginning. They are known as the international indigenous youth council. Four I allied YC. I didn't ever really I know he leaving them. People think kids these days again. Night at a nine nothing in Italy takes it seriously really the whole on the lineal deal and it well like we're really Lisa Meyer. I believe that these started this moment so we would be the lens to make that last and to finish this movement. Because none of us. Are here to losing. Go back home you know. You thank you think those Lexington everybody's gonna help us. It's going to be nice. We're gonna celebrate. I. These started this movement. With Jason charge and then you know dapper image NE two DC in Omaha and they ran a long way that's a long way friend Ken Ambon like Dakota to Washington DC. But they did it. Yeah. The big club. There I was pretty cruel a kind of problem in Gottesman spiritual being and that risks they would do as many people as there was on the run because you're just bringing awareness. I'll might expect the political infants ideas but this plane. I didn't and elegantly too with the specifics. This on massive ceremony. And welfare. And that soon meaning. He is Karen slowly started it cute Stanley. I people they came to the face me. His me my brother Alex in our friend Jason chargers Tyrrell. And a very freeze counseling. Now we're are currently twenty you know kind of wish people fainting coming term meetings between thirty and fifty people. It's powerful to see. Hello no just a small group of people and when there was really no news less than ten of us when we started. Now we have this this whole movement. You know we we laugh together and we kind I didn't know who won big fan me. In its awesome. Because a lot of us here in youth counseling you know me being Andrew who had been a fan like this before. Never had people cared about them you know the way we care about them and it's it's healing. It's historic. We've proven that ended his kids were ripped from their families and cleansed of everything that we had we cut a cutter handy fetus and he spoke our language we weren't allowed to pray we weren't allowed to Wear clothes. We we're not allowed to be who we are. It. And so. Where are finally coming back in where healing with one another and allowing ourselves to become the leaders that we know we are. There's a La in my life that I learned from. I grew up brown. American Indian movement leaders. I come from a long line of land protectors and water protectors. My ancestors no irons Q is to achieve through the whole. Tee time through each side. We've been silent for so long with the historical trauma that we face aren't identity used it for months voices were taken from us. Now we have them that we in the stand further broken she's. Political prisoners and more in this is you know we're in the seventh generation. Simply put to even begin to understand what's happening it's standing rock. You have to go back centuries. The ancestors of the standing rock Sioux originally inhabited the Great Lakes region. The by the seventeenth century an influx of white fur traders and competition among other tribes dwindling resources. Push them west onto the great plan. But the 1840 discovery of gold in California. Unleashed a wave of white fortune seekers who crossed into territory on route. Setting off a series of complications that resulted in the signing of the historic fort Laramie treaty of 1851. In exchange for seating all of their territory east of the Missouri River the Sioux were promised land extending from outside modern day Bismarck, North Dakota. All the way to southern Nebraska. An area that now includes the current code access pipeline route. 1950 when treating entered into a piece. With the federal government before the ink was dry. Question this story coming through. The federal government. Did little to stop white settlers from encroaching further into some links. And a subsequent treaty in 1868. Followed by several congressional acts resulted in the suit losing most of the land originally set aside for them. There's not one senator. One. Back and say our lands were not illegally taking. By the close of the nineteenth century. This you had endured abuse of assimilation schools the outlawing of their religion dependence on government aid. And one of the worst massacres in American history. We live with so many broken promises. There's all these things that happened T tribes over time. Where in just. Were not right and today we're saying no. We'll put this I think it enough is enough respect our lands. Respect our people respect our rights. The companies in the try to ran around this thing through our throats. It's buses they can and they're doing it. Representatives from Energy Transfer Partners parent company to code access pipeline. Declined to be interviewed. But in the past they have claimed the pipeline is a safer alternative to truck in real transportation of crude oil and that it poses no significant threat to the tribes drinking water. Or sacred sites. Likely in reference to a series of 2015 public hearings on the project the tribal officials did not attend. Kelcy Warren the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners told the Wall Street Journal. I really wish for the standing rock suit that they had engaged in discussions way before they did. We could've changed the route he could've been done but it's too late. There's but monitor. Might just push and there's agreement this coma. But according to a newly released audio recording from the first meeting between the tribe in pipeline officials in 2014. A full year before the permitting process began Energy Transfer Partners has known all along of the tribe felt about their project. Network. Good morning thank you so much for allowing us to be here today I am Tammy about what's a code access pipeline and I know that one. The representatives from them from standing rock has and has contacted. The parent company Energy Transfer Partners who owns to put apps has pipeline. With some environmental questions amenities that we're here tend to teach other projects and to answer questions and. And just between this plea is project two don't understand. We recognize our our treaty boundaries. Before they reach he. 1850 when an 1868. Because of that we we oppose the local pipeline we have a spending resolution that was past few dolphins while. That opposes any. Pipeline. Within that treaty bone. Food mostly at all common common in. This is something that the tribe has supporting. The thought that type of not. Which. Vicki Chan. From the beginning it's known by the picks the PUC it's known by the company. Known by an Army Corps of Engineers. That we do not want this pipeline comes. The standard feature has always. Maintain the position that we're about protecting one. We're about protecting there are sacred places where about protecting their sovereign state revolved protecting. On the future. Are our future generations with the children who are not yet born. And we have always opposed the sprightly. Not for any other reasons. Move those our our reasons. But on July 25 2016. Despite pleas from three different federal agencies urging them to consult further with the tribe. The Army Corps of Engineers issued the environmental assessment needed for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River claiming they had adequately consulted with the tried. A month later the tribes in the army corps for not properly consulting them eleven days after that. Energy transfer sued the tribe for blocking construction the fight. Was just getting started. This whistles than that. Created a rising pension and business people spirit plea. And across the world to support is overwhelming and there. Saying enough is you know. Beginning in the spring 2016. The first protest camps begin to take shape just south of pipeline construction sites. He started out small. About 300 people. And after a couple weeks and went to thousands. Tonight everything grew so fast. Winona cast so established the first kitchen at the ocean. Extended Ellis one kitchen and as the Tribe's KM. They created their own kitchen for their people final at one time there was eight non I don't even on how many now. Kitchens aren't the only service found in camp there's an art supply ten. A legal services and a donation center as well as 24 hour medical services and. We have excellent medical services there was doctors nurses and native and herbal medicines lots of skilled. Personnel care. The perhaps the most important service in camp can be found at the indigenous peoples power project. This is stationed. Cars and strength sessions are being offered and then at ten. The orientation goes over a set of principles and about her condition has seen some time here so these senate action that came up. One Texas. If we do our best returns many people's Newton. Mentioned that says. We won't even though it's. It is. A full. Obama is definitely or aspect of it and win this movement starting. Ceremony was held and that ceremony as spiritual guidance him. Experience. As long as people peaceful and careful in this fight that. Went. When this camp started the spirits told us you know. We have to to follow behind the youth and we have to stand prayer. And so you know as a youth council and and you know beings. You know spiritually here for in the youth. No we try to keep people knowing that a state of mind. Where young you know on the front lines there would every on the column we always remind people to stay in prairie enough we see people getting. You know worked very very you know they have and they look like they're having a hard time you know we talk to them we pull them aside. Just because that's kind of their old that we could and we placed ourselves and you know the you know I really empowers people known to to see young people doing this we want people to to see yes than know who we are and know that we're there to help. Nowhere in the seventeen nation. We're not here to to change the world. We're here to. Ignite the flames start. The sport's first for the generation and a fifth of that they'll have this strong sense of unity you know have the strong sense of sovereignty. No from a young age and me personally. And I'm willing to send my life on the line to protect smother. To protect this way of life from human commandeered. And so I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I hope it doesn't come down to that no known. Crazy Horse. In one sentence in today's a good day today. On September 3 2016. Dakota access pipeline construction crews began bulldozing ground that had only a day earlier been identified by the tried in court as containing secret sites. In response hundreds of people climbed the fence to confront the construction workers. Among them the machinists upwelling and I YC member. When we first got there. Anything about what looked to be about seven individuals. Having these dogs than holding on to them and it looked at this dogs because. She got. Mean dog and with the in two. Traditionally is sick so I leaned down and it crowds. Can liken us locked position going conscience. Two in the current. When I try to going to petted the woman. Then. Tap the Syed that and had the dog in between relayed you know short leash on it. And then that don't hesitate. When it looked at me. It didn't actress than she did it again and then lunch and being fit me right on my right breast. You know I kinda sat back. And they did fill it just the committees and Philip. And then somebody turned the means they said your bleeding and they looked down and my whole breast was full blood. In there is hope and simmered in mind teacher. And construction crews eventually left the scene that day. Police reported that several private security officers were injured during the confrontation. Everything you've been here hands and social media social media that this is has been peaceful. And they wanted to do it by fair this is not too weak to do this Disney's Cuba come to an end he's in agreement that needs to go with throttle. Leadership. And get together and put an end to this an issue that has done properly in the courts and not done this. Yeah. Tribal officials claimed twelve people were bitten by the security dogs. The dog handlers did not respond ABC news' request for comment but a subsequent investigation by the local sheriff's office found. They were not properly licensed. That Dave I got bit by a dog. With only the beginning of their violence. Now today's. Were shot at with all rubber bullets. May starting spot with its big cans and peppers very. Smoke canisters thrown at us. When we did not when we're doing nothing but wanting them kick it off ticket plan. I'm Tobin turning back and we wind says stand in solidarity and pain. Fire Brothers and sisters that headlock down arms and equipment. They seem like we're just surrounded by riot police and army vehicles tonight. And it officers standing train that runs in Chicago and then I'll list on this select students for a peaceful people like you know we are praying. Or. As law enforcement closed in on her group. Lauren says she began trying to convince the officers to let a small child seeing. I was speaking to an off stage and I have noticed. Member of the National Guard behind him he was in military fatigues as and had to face mask on in. He was head of the turn in his hand and he was like. Right behind them like just staring at me I would just noticing an announcement Texas office. So my name grabbed the Blaine name motioned for the officers take him so he can. And a scene that Cobb. I just think he was back there and then this speculating as in friend my face with that the turned. Town meeting get the F bag. And he this site. Started in like bashing my hand. Well it's aim them and in the boy I was still with me. And I had to push the blame back in my friendly and Danny that the plane returned the console of women. Like the cut just came at me gain get that back in. I had to put my hand dipped to protect my hang. And he just like asses like three or four different times and I guess I didn't notice it offers is adrenaline. But as those walking away just felt it really hurting and you know appendages was like oh yeah guy Kidd. He had a happy and then that's a real thing that just happens. It. Boren says she was first rushed back to the medic tent to camp then to a nearby reservation hospital. This senate this mother's body small fractures in the night tiny little bottles of Marius. Because I can't. Can't end it like it's patriots' maintenance. Mosaic okay. Although the hills and I can't really stop it and doing you know this could have bodies at risk it lives. October 22 marked the first mass arrests carried out by the Morton county sheriff's office which denied boring story in an email to ABC news. More than a 140 people were rested. Including several journalists. Lauren returned to the front lines the next day. And less than a week later on October 27 police forces would clear a newly established winter camp on land owned by decode access pipeline. It was known as sacred grounds. All of us that in. You see these military vehicles as humvees. Slowly inching towards us with men. Both sides and then there are under the cops there and they were coming out us. And we didn't know it's do. Or I. Are you can count they learned a rescue people laughed and I knew there may mean people. Mailers hitting people at the time and you know win this thing on this it's scary. It's not easy because my sister likes to down in the Frontline. Yeah officer at that. Actions handed grab my areas in case some terrorist Osama look NN -- intends. Right away went from there is student misses again. Let's take care and their rents and a couple people from behind grabbed me. So I can't get away and I just got to back that they went back. Mean. It's gonna hang any league either way I could either be her at can't feeling sorry for his where can be at the front lines hurting him. Helping people. How far council members were. Arrested that day. We were on nine minutes we were in he's been weavers and prayers. People. We're also getting out of hand and archives by by us now. I don't blame them you know this has happened for so long that it's not gonna happen right now in this tender age. You know after we were arrested they how this on the side of their road. For hours. While bulldozers. Known win over there. The burial sites known they were working you know full force behind us. And we had to say there you know with restraints on and watch that happen. It was. It was a sad day. And clearing of sacred grounds can could result in more than a 140 arrests. Police claimed rocks and other decree were thrown at them due to the outbreak of several fires nearly all of those arrested were charged with a felony count of conspiracy to endanger by fire or explosion. But those charges were later thrown out by a judge. Most of those who arrested that day were first brought the Morton county law enforcement center for processing. Before being shipped out to jails all across the state. They would which you re in holding cells as they call on all of us have our rests just referred to him as dog kennel. Her basically. Chain link fence wire mesh cells. Bought ten feet by twelve to fourteen feet long. And I know that the sheriff departments come out and said that these holding cells. As they call him were approved by the department of corrections the dog kennels again refer them to or in their parking garage for the or via. County jail so here you have guys with just their hats. Coal concrete floor. In a parking garage and sighed dog kennels with the ambient air temperature being around 4045. Degrees. They call that approved by the department corrections. Well we call it a humane. Like everyone else arrested that day a number was written on Ron's arm for identification purposes. And so the idea that that's the only way they can recognize you with buy your number. We find that very offensive. To be right keepers keeping us in and you mean dog kennels and writing numbers on us. Doubts that's just not a -- get treated in America are not supposed to get treated. Morton county sheriff Kyle Kirch Meyer told ABC news in a brief interview that the protest activities that standing rock and put a tremendous amount of strain on his officers. Well as we go through this and you know as this has started back since August 10. And so it's been on it's going on for. A time now and it definitely is very. Taxing and straining as we continue to. To find the very peaceful resolution to you know to go to the protest into the activities soul. You know you just gotta take it and I take it dated date if you go to work. You see what happens in you you go from there but the number one thing here is maintaining the public safety. And that goal is not between. The sheriff has long claimed the protests are not peaceful. And that his officers have behaved professionally in an extremely difficult situation. Law enforcement isn't the aggressor here and we are not the attackers the only time that law enforcement is responding. To these situations. Is win the aggression is taken out against law enforcement. And we have the right and the lawful duty to make sure that the pieces maintain. And that's what we're doing. When we aren't confronted me. We don't want to become the very thing that is hurting. Front yeah. And in the aftermath of the confrontations at the sacred grounds camp the international indigenous youth council feared the movement might lose its grounding in peaceful ceremony. It's along with other groups that can't be helped organize an action they hoped would restore a sense of harmony. They called it the forgiveness march him. That forgiveness for actions or if I loved how it happened because that in violated any traffic. I remember walking through this the tunnel a tunnel that went across the bridge. And I'm really looking back and theme. The Clinton people here on tunneling through with little those little path. They were on there to pray. On the air district and an ambulance. Own way. You know was just like. I felt really felt really really good about that day soon. When we yeah. I didn't go out. Okay. Again. Oh. This is a great opportunities grass really to connect with. The police officers on a human to human level I don't think the police officers are horrible people the people that are here like we're not. We're not fighting against. For peace initiatives department you know like grace period to stop crying in here to protect water. I hope it touches some of their heart. News it. On average let me having. Eaton. I severely hard. At this time we must also say that we are not perfect. People I've gotten. We did things and he's got things on that that pay. Or not find this. All issue up humility. Lucky to stay. Somewhat mild she told me. Not only mean. I forget it. It also means I'm asking you to give me. So we stand here today. Acknowledged. Pit bulls eyes and how to parent. And dinner. I. Back to camp the next day DI YC let another action aimed at bringing the movement back to its center. We want and to do not just a prayer march. Just to keep you remind people why we're here. So we did a silent march. Was it. No silence ourselves and we've we've already been silenced for so long over the past few centuries. But it was more to showed discipline. You know and humanity. It was kind of hard to believe that you know. There was 400 people locking behind me because you couldn't here's thing. When the marchers reached the barricaded the back water bridge to row another highway C members had the rest of the group wait for they approached the police line. Today bridge. And we prayed with the police there we offered them on her that that we prayed with music you know ceremony. Known there was five of them on the and one of them you know except in offered. Not only us that de officers are also humans. But it also showed you know a lot of humility. And period should on the officers part knowing that you're known by taking that liberian. By a crane with us he knew that the other officers there would know would treat him differently. And something that I'll never forget just because. Of how together we Wear in you know unified we were. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the arrival of winter did little to persuade people to leave camp. And wood and propane continue to pour in that's pence gave way to hard structure. Yeah yeah. It's. But on the night of November 20. The movement would get its first taste of what the winter meant for direct action on the high planes. Extradite here to the new flashpoint in the pipeline showdown North Dakota hundreds of protesters clashing with police and right here. Trying to block the pipelines construction. After seven demonstrators tried to move burnt out vehicles from the backwater bridge they were joined by hundreds of others who lined up in front of the police they're. Letters saying that with play. Two high pressure hoses. They would try to get someone's go down. And then once there and go down there just to act this very canons of right after them. By then there are due. Shooting tear gas at us. Garrity using water hose third shooting everybody with rubber bullet defendants. I'll let tear gas in my chest her flight maybe a week is pretty traumatized and you know monitor to see all that in. There is hard to see anything in hard to talk about it right now. Police described the night of November 20 as the riot. Heart. Quote data shot him. For speaking. Shot. The standing rock medic in healing council reported over 300 injuries that evening with when he six haven't been taken to hospital. Okay. Three days later on November Toney fifth the army corps issued what amounted to an eviction notice. By December 5 their lands would no longer be open to the public meaning everyone at the ocean Jessica we campus had to leave. Out. The announcement was quickly followed by an evacuation order issued by the governor and the more in county sheriff's department warned that anyone carrying supplies to camp. Would be subject to a thousand dollar fine. And yeah. I mean yeah. Ronnie. Hanging. That. Really hinging insight. Telling people who are already extremely annoyed that if you're really annoyed about it on this we'll have army tents over their sad. And if you really paranoid about viewing your kids we'll have those ready for use the you can go ahead sleep in there until that time passes. There going to do these companies. From the few about it. I phone carrier. You know this is my life in the past demons and connect with people in. To me. You know when I. And it's getting. And the DI YC and the winter was off to a bad start. But then an opportunity arose due. Sheriff's department and put out a list of donations. That police officers are asking for. And specifically the police officers who have been. Nexus barricade and up here. And so day youth council as the senate we're gonna take them those donations. Are saying hey you know like you my. Chang cut off the supplies that wears. Give an end but. Regardless of what you do we're still here and prayer and we're still gonna be you know giving our heart and are solace to those who are in need and if you guys need stuff like here it is. They. Now need to move. Apparently from bank. We give this year we're going to be very scared because we'll open the door and I message saying they didn't have anything on it. We'll. If capsule. Has always been and will always continue to be about prayer and peace in no matter how violent they get you know like. Wait we don't hate them the cops and he's seen the pet plant workers and me they're just ended and we pray for everybody and one in monetary means careful and peaceful. This that's that's how we get we're not gonna win be inviolate back to him. OK. Yeah. Yeah. I. Okay. And now a major development in the long running standoff over the Dakota access pipeline a major victory for the Sioux tribe it's standing rock. The Army Corps of Engineers halted construction of the Dakota access bloodline. On December 4 2016. The army announced it would not approve the easement needed for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River. Pledging to consider alternative routes and a full environmental impact statement. It. Excludes food and rent it now goes a little bit of yeah I'm not. Oh. It's an indigenous person sometimes growing everything nobody sees you as. Killing people don't want you around him feel like if you just disappeared everybody would just be happy and it feels staved. To be acknowledged as a human being. This is just a small victory but what we're saying is that if you think you're gonna endangered. The lives and any human being indigenous or not. You have to go through us first we protect this earth and you will have a very difficult time doing that. People have been fighting for so long you know it is indigenous people. And vehemently. That is. A at. It's done their purpose has been. There. By then. Staying there is only jeopardizes. People's lives than that puts people in harm's way. In the wake of the army's announcement. Dave arch invoke the chairman of the standing rock Sioux pleaded for people to leave the camps as a brutal winter storm approached. But many occasions including DIY scene the vowed to continue the fight. I know that in a way it seems say this isn't over. This is part. I believe that we have had an easier way that we still have a lot of work to do to ensure that it stops. As far as downtown goes and other things that's where our problem. I'll indigenous people. Our indigenous resources are going to be at risk. Govern our land. From this day forward. It's going to be only America. First. Maric. Hours. Prior to his election Donald Trump's presidential campaign received more than a 1 dollars from Kelsey ward the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners. Trump also held significant investments in the companies involved with the construction and operation of the code access pipeline. And although trump claimed to have since purged himself of such investments he has offered no substantial proof of that claim. And in the meantime is selected Rick Perry who is sat on the Energy Transfer Partners board to head the Department of Energy. This is with respect to the construction of the Dakota access. Pipeline. Dakota axis. Again. Subject. Terms and conditions. To being burned here. It. Less than a week after taking office trump signed a memorandum ordering the Army Corps of Engineers to review and approve the pipeline. In an expedited manner. I just blind. People term member and not just. Turn a blind I after this. This is it today's hot news this is it at trending topic. My biggest fears that people will just see this as a Woodstock. See this as as festival hours show it as soon as it's over there's gonna go. Back to their ignorant lives and pretending everything's all right now we got our pictures with the Indians. Now we come back home. Indeed house couple of months have been. A painfully beautiful experience. But that's in my hand is. How much we as a people have grown. How much we as a people have read dean our power have regained her voice. How much music people now how. Power to influence and other cattle people can begin to bring back back hope bring back that.

                              "text": "With votes continuing to be counted in very close elections in Florida, Georgia and Arizona, President Donald Trump and some other Republicans have been crying foul, making false and misleading claims of supposed election fraud perpetrated by Democrats in an attempt to \u201csteal\u201d the elections.There is no evidence of\u00a0an organized effort by Democrats to \u201csteal\u201d elections,\u00a0and the ballot counting is proceeding in due course. It often takes more than a week for counties around the country to count mail-in, absentee and provisional ballots. What\u2019s unusual is that these ballots could tilt the results one way or the other. And in Florida, a mandatory recount has already been triggered in the elections for U.S. Senate and for governor.Nonetheless, the president and other Republicans have been muddying the national dialogue and spinning the facts:In his claims, the president has alleged the Florida vote count has been \u201cmassively infected\u201d with \u201clarge numbers of new ballots\u201d showing up \u201cout of nowhere\u201d while other ballots are \u201cmissing or forged.\u201d And he has claimed election officials are suspiciously \u201cfinding votes in Florida and Georgia\u201d after the election. But there is no evidence of any of that.In Florida, where Trump has focused much of his ire and Gov. Scott warned \u201cthere may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties,\u201d election officials say there has been no evidence to date of any criminal tampering with election results.On Nov. 12, a\u00a0spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, which supervises elections,\u00a0reiterated\u00a0that it was overseeing the certification of election results and to date had seen \u201cno evidence of criminal activity.\u201d The department is headed by Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican appointed by Scott. And despite Scott and State Attorney General Pam Bondi urging the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to look into potential voter fraud,\u00a0FDLE says\u00a0so far it hasn\u2019t seen anything to investigate. That doesn\u2019t mean there haven\u2019t been some problematic election issues in Florida. For example,\u00a0CNN reported\u00a0that a North Florida county hit by Hurricane Michael allowed about 150 ballots to be submitted by fax and email, contrary to Florida Department of State guidelines. And it is possible that some incidents involving fraud may come to light, such as a person with a felony conviction voting even though their voting rights have not been restored, said\u00a0Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers University and author of \u201cThe Myth of Voter Fraud. But Minnite said that she is not aware of evidence of any kind of voter fraud in Florida, Georgia or Arizona.During an emergency hearing on Nov. 12,\u00a0Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter\u00a0said he had seen no evidence of illegal activity in the vote-counting in Broward County, and he urged both sides to \u201cramp down the rhetoric.\u201d\u201cEverything the lawyers are saying out there at the elections office is being beamed out across the country,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cWe should be careful what we say. These words mean things these days.\u201dTrump says that the races in Florida for Senate and governor were \u201cwon\u201d on election night by the Republican candidates, Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, respectively, and now the Democrats are trying to go back and \u201cSTEAL two big elections.\u201d But the president simply got out in front of the final tallies, which won\u2019t ultimately be known until all of the absentee and provisional ballots are counted.And, because the races are so close, an automatic recount also has been triggered.\u201cRick Scott \u2026 won by a comfortable margin,\u201d Trump told reporters on Nov. 9. \u201cHe easily won, but every hour it seems to be going down.\u201dTrump echoed those sentiments on Twitter.Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him \u201cback into play.\u201d Bill Nelson conceded Election \u2013 now he\u2019s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018Asked on\u00a0ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d\u00a0on Nov. 11 if the president had any evidence that Democrats are trying to \u201csteal\u201d the elections, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said, \u201cWell the evidence is that Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have won. In fact, Andrew Gillum conceded on the night of the election, now we\u2019re going backwards.\u201d (Gillum\u00a0withdrew\u00a0his concession a day earlier on Nov. 10. )But election night results are always preliminary, and provisional and absentee ballots take more time to process. When elections aren\u2019t particularly close, the public doesn\u2019t notice that it usually takes more than a week to certify election results.\u201cThe count is never final on election night \u2013 each state has a deadline for certifying the election, and counties (and in some states, towns) are crossing i\u2019s and dotting t\u2019s until then,\u201d Loyola Law School Professor Justin Levitt, an expert in election fraud, told us via email.\u201cMore generally, what is happening in these three states\u00a0[Florida, Georgia and Arizona] is that various elections for Senator and Governor were really close, and so a lot of attention has focused on absentee ballots and particularly provisional ballots, and on checking the tallies of ballots from election night,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cBut that same process is going on in elections all across the country: election officials are assessing absentee and provisional ballots to see whether they were properly cast by eligible, properly registered voters each voting once, and double-checking the tallies of regular ballots cast at the polls.\u201dNever mind that some networks will project the winner of a close race, as some did for DeSantis on election night.\u201cWhen the networks \u2018call\u2019 the election on election night, what they\u2019re doing is assessing the likelihood of a final result based on exit polls and early tallies from polling places (and from absentee ballots that the jurisdiction may have already counted), and making statistical assessments of the likelihood that once all ballots are cast, the person who won could have actually lost,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cBut election results are never instantaneous, and every single one of the network\u2019s announcements is a preliminary estimate. \u2026 [T]he results from election night for some of the races were really close \u2026 and so crossing each \u201ct\u201d and dotting each \u201cI\u201d may matter a lot in who wins. But the process that\u2019s going on in Florida and Georgia and Arizona is pretty much the same thing that\u2019s happening even for races where the result is more certain, all across the country.\u201dLorraine Minnite, at Rutgers University, said most people probably pay little attention to election administration, such as the \u201coften intricate rules that govern election procedures, including ballot counting.\u201d\u201cIn addition, most elections are not tight nail-biters,\u201d Minnite told us via email. \u201cI can understand why the average citizen might be confused about why the elections in Georgia, Florida and Arizona have not yet been decided. But, no one should worry yet \u2013 close elections take longer to count, and all ballots must be accounted for.\u201dAt this point she said she has seen no evidence of election fraud.Trump has repeatedly referred to election officials suspiciously \u201cfinding\u201d votes for Democrats. But there is no evidence to date that vote counts have been influenced by anything other than legally cast ballots. Indeed, most of the changing vote totals have been due to officials tallying mail-in, provisional and absentee ballots not counted on Election Day.Trump told reporters\u00a0on Nov. 9 that in Florida, \u201call of a sudden, they\u2019re finding votes out of nowhere.\u201d In Arizona, he said, \u201call of a sudden, out of the wilderness, they find a lot of votes.\u201d And, Trump said, \u201cDo you notice, the votes never go the other way [in Republicans favor]?\u201dTrump raised similar concerns about \u201cfound\u201d votes on Twitter:You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia \u2013 but the Election was on Tuesday? Let\u2019s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u201cfound\u201d many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \u201cThe Broward Effect.\u201d How come they never find Republican votes?\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018In the case of Arizona, it simply takes longer to count ballots because about 75 percent of Arizona voters cast ballots by mail. Although Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally appeared to be winning the race on election night, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema pulled ahead by about 2,000 votes after Maricopa County released the results of 120,000 outstanding ballots available two days after the election. By Nov. 12, Sinema\u2019s lead had grown to more than 32,000 votes, CNN reported. That night, the Associated Press projected Sinema as the winner of the race, and McSally called Sinema to concede the race.In Florida, the vote differentials have changed as counties began to submit tallies from provisional and absentee ballots.\u201cThe election officials aren\u2019t finding votes \u2013 they\u2019re counting votes that were not cast as regular ballots on election day,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThe ballots were already there: they\u2019re revealing for whom those ballots were cast. That\u2019s a whole lot different from \u2018finding\u2019 new votes.\u201dIn fact, it is possible that not all ballots have even arrived. The state accepts ballots from military and overseas voters until Nov. 16, provided they are postmarked Nov. 6.The president is also wrong to say election officials have not been \u201cfinding\u201d Republican votes as well.\u201cThere are many tens of thousands of ballots being evaluated, some of which reveal votes for Republicans, some of which reveal votes for Democrats, some of which reveal votes for both (for different offices), some of which reveal votes for neither,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThe reports in the press generally only give the net differential margin, and in this case the Democratic candidates have been narrowing the margin as more votes are counted. But that does not mean that only votes for Democrats have been counted. In reality, there have been many votes for Republicans counted since the election as well.\u201dIn Florida, a teacher at Miramar Elementary School in Broward County said she came across a box labelled \u201cProvisional Ballot Box.\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio retweeted a report of what he called the \u201cleft behind\u201d box and criticized Broward County officials for \u201capparently\u201d misplacing ballots. \u201cJust let that sink in for a moment,\u201d Rubio tweeted. But county election officials say the boxes at the school contained no ballots \u2014 just election supplies. Election experts say mismatched signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots, compared with voter registration documents, are actually fairly common, and aren\u2019t necessarily evidence of fraud. Rather, handwriting can change over time, so a legal voter could be deemed to have a mismatched signature from when he or she registered to vote years before.But in a tweet, Trump said reports that \u201cSIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH\u201d on some ballots in Arizona meant there had been \u201celectoral corruption\u201d and\u00a0may be grounds to consider a new election.Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON\u2019T MATCH. Electoral corruption \u2013 Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018And on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Nov. 11, Scott alleged his Democratic opponent has \u201cgone to court to say that fraudulent ballots, fraudulent ballots that were not properly delivered, sign, whatever should have \u2014 should be counted, OK? Senator Nelson is clearly trying to find \u2014 to try and commit fraud to try to win this election. That\u2019s all this is.\u201dStates have different procedures to check if the signatures on absentee and provisional ballots match the signatures the voters gave when registering to vote, and what to do about it if they don\u2019t.A lawsuit filed by the Nelson campaign against the Florida secretary of state argues that tens of thousands of Floridians who voted via provisional ballot are at risk of disenfranchisement due to a \u201cstandardless signature matching process.\u201d The suit seeks to prevent the state from rejecting ballots with mismatched signatures. It is scheduled to be heard this week.According to the suit, the state\u2019s \u201centirely standardless, inconsistent, and unreliable signature matching process\u201d has \u201ca disparate impact on People of Color and young, first time voters, violates the prohibition against undue burdens on the right to vote \u2026 and subjects Florida voters to disparate treatment and inconsistent standards in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.\u201dAccording to a 2016 survey by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1 percent of absentee ballots nationally were rejected in the 2016 election, and \u201cnon-matching signature\u201d was the top reason (27.5 percent). See Table 1.\u201cIt is not unusual to find signatures that don\u2019t match,\u201d Minnite said. \u201cHandwriting can change over time, and a voter who has been registered at the same address for many years who votes irregularly may find him or herself in a situation where the elections office asks for an updated signature.\u201dStates have different procedures to check signatures on ballots. Some states have automated systems that do initial screens of signatures, followed by a human review of rejected ballots due to mismatches. In some states, Minnite said, if a signature on a mail ballot doesn\u2019t match, the voter may be contacted to come into the election office to provide an updated signature.In Arizona, only a handful of counties allowed voters to verify their signatures after the election, and a legal battle between Democrats and Republicans resulted in a settlement that will allow all Arizona counties to verify ballot signatures until 5 p.m. on Nov. 14.In Florida, it\u2019s misleading for Scott to call ballots with mismatched signatures \u201cfraudulent ballots.\u201d Indeed, former Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy tweeted on Nov. 9 that he discovered his absentee ballot wasn\u2019t counted in Palm Beach County \u201cdue to \u2018invalid signature\u2019 match.\u201d\u201cPeople\u2019s signatures change over time, and in different situations,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cYour signature on a supermarket checkout machine is probably not the same signature as on the deed to a house.\u201dIt\u2019s also important to note, Levitt said, that \u201cthe signatures on provisional and absentee ballots are all evaluated before anyone knows who the ballot is cast for: the signature is on the outside of an envelope, and the ballot is on the inside, and you can\u2019t tell who the votes were cast for looking at the outside of the envelope. So the decisions on counting or not counting provisional or absentee ballots are made independent of the identity of the voter\u2019s preferred candidates.\u201dOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Scott claimed, \u201cSen. Nelson\u2019s lawyer said that a noncitizen should have the right to vote.\u201d\u00a0But that\u2019s not clear from the evidence.In a brief exchange during a canvassing board meeting, a lawyer representing Nelson objected after a provisional ballot was disqualified because the voter was deemed to be \u201cnot a citizen.\u201dThe Nelson campaign\u2019s lead recount attorney later said the lawyer was \u201cnot authorized to make such an objection\u201d and that \u201cnoncitizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\u201dScott\u2019s claim came during an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d on Nov. 11. Host Chris Wallace asked him, \u201cYou\u2019re accusing Bill Nelson of trying to commit fraud?\u201dScott responded, \u201cHis lawyer said that a noncitizen should vote.\u201dFox News,\u00a0Daily Caller and The Blaze all obtained a transcript of a Palm Beach County Canvassing Board proceeding on Nov. 9 when officials were reviewing provisional ballots. According to the transcript, provided by a court reporter hired by the Palm Beach County GOP, when one provisional ballot was discarded, Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher explained, \u201cNot a U.S. citizen; not counted.\u201d The transcript states that lawyer Jack Scarola responded, \u201cObjection Nelson.\u201dNo explanation was provided for the objection, and the ballot was quickly disallowed after a 2-1 vote in which Bucher and\u00a0Judge August Bonavita voted not to count it. We could not reach Scarola to determine why he objected, or if he was attempting to argue the person was misidentified as a noncitizen. It is a leap from that brief exchange to claim the attorney \u201csaid that a noncitizen should have the right to vote.\u201dAs the stories note, Marc Elias, recount attorney for the Nelson campaign, later issued a statement saying, \u201cThe lawyer who was present was not someone we had authorized to make such an objection. Noncitizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\u201dThe president suggested that\u00a0Fusion GPS, a research firm that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to investigate Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, had something to do with the vote counting in Florida. It doesn\u2019t.The tenuous connection is that the attorney for Nelson\u2019s campaign in Florida, Elias, also represented the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016, when he hired Fusion GPS to research Trump.Trump made the claim during remarks to reporters before he departed for Europe on Nov. 9.Trump, Nov. 9:\u00a0And Rick Scott, who won by \u2014 you know, it was close, but he won by a comfortable margin \u2014 every couple of hours it goes down a little bit. And then you see the people, and they were involved with that fraud of the fake dossier, the phony dossier. And I guess I hear they were somehow involved or worked with the GPS Fusion people, who have committed \u2014 I mean, if you look at what they\u2019ve done, you look at the dishonesty.During his remarks, a reporter asked if Trump had any evidence of fraud. The president responded: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, you tell me. It\u2019s always the Democrats. It\u2019s always GPS Fusion. It\u2019s always crooked stuff.\u201dFusion GPS was\u00a0founded by former\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporters\u00a0Glenn R. Simpson\u00a0and\u00a0Peter Fritsch. In 2016, the law firm Perkins Coie, and specifically Elias, represented Clinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC and\u00a0hired\u00a0Fusion GPS, which subsequently hired Steele. (Previously,\u00a0the conservative\u00a0Washington Free Beacon\u00a0had hired\u00a0Fusion GPS to investigate Trump and other Republican primary candidates. )Steele\u2019s research made up the dossier, a series of memos on\u00a0supposed contacts between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign. It alleged the Kremlin has compromising information on Trump.It\u2019s no surprise that Nelson would want to hire Elias during the recount. Elias\u2019 bio says \u201che is a preeminent counselor in the areas of federal and state campaign finance law \u2026 as well as recounts and election contests. He is also a nationally recognized authority and spearheads litigation efforts in the areas of voting rights and redistricting.\u201d",

                              "text": "FILE \u2013 In this Thursday, Feb. 2, 2012 file photo, Donald Trump greets Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, after announcing his endorsement of Romney during a news conference in Las Vegas. Trump is endorsing Romney in Utah\u2019s Senate race, another sign that the two Republicans are burying the hatchet after a fraught relationship. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File)  The Washington Examiner has a substantive piece on Mitt Romney and his attempt to close his political career as Senator from Utah. Romney is probably a lock for the seat despite him coming in second in the GOP nominating convention. The big question is how Senator Romney will interact with President Trump after the rather disastrous relationship they had during the 2016 campaign.  This is how CNN reported on it:  Mitt Romney delivered a sweeping broadside against Donald Trump on Thursday, laying into the Republican presidential front-runner with a sharper attack than any of the party\u2019s 2016 contenders have made against the billionaire business mogul. \u201cHere\u2019s what I know: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,\u201d Romney said. \u201cHis promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He\u2019s playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.\u201d Romney said that \u201cdishonesty is Donald Trump\u2019s hallmark,\u201d pointing to his \u201cbullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics.\u201d  There\u2019s irony in Romney\u2019s speech: Just four years ago, he courted Trump\u2019s endorsement \u2014 even after Trump had led the \u201cbirther\u201d controversy against President Barack Obama, insisting that Obama release his birth certificate to prove he is an American citizen.  (Here is my critique of Romney\u2019s critique of Trump at the time of the speech.)  And let\u2019s not forget the spectacle of Romney interviewing for and being rejected as Secretary of State. (My post on why he was a terrible choice.)  Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state https://t.co/HDtpjeJTc3 \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016  Via the Washington Examiner:  Indeed, in conversations with voters who visited his booth at the Utah GOP convention, Romney crowed about a personal relationship with Trump that goes back decades, before either were politicians. Romney paid Trump perhaps the ultimate compliment when he said that the president\u2019s achievements are similar to what he would have done had he won the White House six years ago. \u201cHis first year is very similar to things I\u2019d have done my first year,\u201d Romney said in response to one of the many questions he received regarding how he plans to work with Trump given their complicated history. \u201cThe things he\u2019s actually done have been better than I expected.\u201d Romney isn\u2019t the first Republican to be tied in knots discussing his support for the president. In one exchange, he added a verbal inflection on the word \u201cdoing\u201d as he attempted to distinguish between Trump\u2019s rhetoric and his actions, and explain how he reconciles his opposition to the troubling things he says (and tweets) with what has turned out to be a pretty traditional GOP governing agenda that any of his opponents in the 2016 presidential primary would have pursued. \u201cIf he says something which I believe is racist or divisive and serious, then I\u2019ll point out that I disagree with that,\u201d Romney told one voter. \u201cBut I\u2019m an honest enough person that if he does something right \u2014 and by the way he\u2019s done a number of things right \u2014 I\u2019ll be fully supportive of those things. I will support the president\u2019s agenda when it\u2019s good for Utah, and good for the country, and so far that\u2019s been the case.\u201d  It is hard to see some of this as being anything other than Romney reverting to his well know Pander-Bear persona. There is a chance that Trump is more popular in Utah than Romney and so a close attachment to Trump is needed if he is to get the nomination. But seriously, does anyone think a party apparatchik (NTTAWWT) like Romney would have Trump\u2019s record on the nomination of conservative judges? Would guys like Pruitt and Zinke be at EPA and Interior? Would a pro-abstinence activist be heading up HHS\u2019s Title X Family Planning program? Would he have bullied Kim Jong Un to the peace table? Would he have left the Paris Accord? Would he have betrayed his Chamber of Commerce brethren and cracked down on illegal immigration? No. None of that. He would have been a more respectable and aesthetically pleasing President, for sure. But would he have appointed similar people to top positions? No way possible.",

                              "text": "Warning: Prilosec Can Cause Serious Stomach Infection February 15, 2017 | 1,118   \nHeartburn medications in the class of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most commonly used drugs in the world. Once available only by prescription, Prilosec, Prevacid and Nexium are three of the PPIs now available over-the-counter. \nCommonly prescribed to relieve symptoms of acid reflux and indigestion, they have a number of unintended consequences that negatively impact your health. \nHeartburn occurs when acid refluxes up your esophagus, burning tissue not designed to withstand the lower pH fluid in your stomach. Acid is necessary for digestion, and protects you against bacteria. \nThere are a variety of reasons acid may pass the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and trigger heartburn, but most are related to a hiatal hernia or an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). \nSimple lifestyle changes will often treat occasional heartburn effectively, but chronic pain over many weeks may require making a few more changes. It's important to realize that PPIs may actually do more harm than good, as they are associated with a greater risk of bone fractures, kidney disease, cognitive dysfunction and more. \nAn editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2010 espoused the idea that less health care may result in better health. 1 In the coming years other editorials advocated the same approach, 2 , 3 , 4 as it is difficult to deny the results people get when they eat the foods their body requires to stay healthy. Digestion Requires Acid \nDigestion of food begins in your mouth as the food is broken into smaller pieces and mixed with saliva before traveling down your esophagus and into your stomach. As food passes into your stomach, it mixes with hydrochloric acid required to breakdown food into even smaller pieces from which your small intestines can extract nutrients. 5 \nYour body absorbs nutrients through the small intestines before passing waste products into the large intestines and out the rectum. PPI medications are designed to inhibit the proton pump that produces acid. \nPPIs do not specifically target the cells in your stomach, and stomach acid is usually not the primary trigger behind chronic heartburn. Stomach acid is necessary for digestion, and most of the time a lack of stomach acid is the trigger for heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) and chronic indigestion. \nIn such cases, PPIs can actually exacerbate the problem by decreasing acid further. Unless an endoscopy has confirmed high levels of stomach acid, it's more likely you don't have enough. \nThere is a simple test you can use to determine if your level is low and this knowledge will help you develop a natural plan to reduce your chronic pain. This simple test is a rough indicator of how much acid your stomach produces. \nMix a teaspoon of baking soda in 8 ounces of cold water and drink it first thing in the morning, before eating or drinking anything. The combination of baking soda and hydrochloric acid in your stomach creates carbon dioxide gas, causing you to belch. 6 \nTime yourself for up to five minutes for how long it takes you to form enough gas in your stomach to belch. Belching in two to three minutes is normal; earlier and repeated belching indicates an excess of acid. If you don't belch after five minutes, you likely don't produce enough acid. Lack of Acid Changes Nutrient Absorption and Increases Risk of Infection \nTogether with pepsin, hydrochloric acid is necessary to break down protein in your intestinal tract, so a reduction in acid from a lack of production or from use of PPIs changes nutrient absorption. \nWithout adequate breakdown of protein , you increase potential of experiencing dysbiosis, 7 or an imbalance in gut microbiome between pathogenic bacteria and friendly bacteria. \nAs these protein molecules ferment in your intestines they become food for pathogens such as H. pylori, C. difficile, and candida. An overgrowth of these bacteria may also lead to leaky gut . \nThere are a number of secondary effects from leaking molecules from your intestinal tract, including a rising number of children suffering from autism , difficulty losing weight , increasing number of neurological disorders and allergies. \nA recent study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology once again confirms the risk of infection when taking PPIs. 8 \nCompared to those not taking PPIs, participants who did had a 1.7 to 3.7 times increased risk of developing C. difficile or campylobacter infection. Among hospitalized patients, those numbers increased to between 1.4 and 4.5 times the risk. \nAlthough both of these bacteria trigger abdominal pain and diarrhea, C. difficile may become more serious. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 500,000 were infected in 2011 and 29,000   month. 9 \nThis study was not the first to raise concerns about the increased risk of contracting these infections. \nC. difficile triggers significant diarrhea and is associated with morbidity and rising healthcare costs in hospitalized patients. 10 A meta-analysis performed using research between 1990 and 2010 found a significant increase in the number of people using PPIs and the risk of contracting C. difficile. 11 Heartburn Medications Affect Your Brain Function \nStudies consistently demonstrate PPIs are being over prescribed, 12 and now used in excess as they are available over-the-counter. Researchers estimate up to 70 percent of people using the medications have no   indication. \nThat number is likely much higher as many may not receive or follow recommendations to make lifestyle changes that may reduce their symptoms. \nOne devastating effect of the medication are the cognitive changes individuals can experience after even short-term use. One study evaluated the effect of five different PPIs over the course of only one week of use in 60 healthy participants. 13 \nUsing neurophysiological testing, the study found statistically and clinically significant impairments in the participants' executive functions , visual memory and planning function, each of which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. \nTwo studies published the following year concluded those taking PPIs   developing Alzheimer's disease. 14 , 15 \nThe study published in JAMA also found a strong statistical link between regular use of PPIs and developing Alzheimer's in their pool of nearly 74,000 participants, who did not have dementia at the start of the study. 16 \nOne characteristic of dementia is the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain that provoke inflammation and ultimately kill brain cells. There is now strong scientific evidence that use of PPIs not only increases production of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain but slows the ability of the body to eliminate them as well. 17 , 18 , 19 Prolonged Use of PPIs Carries Further Risks \nA large data-mining study performed by researchers from Stanford University discovered long-term use of PPIs were also associated with a 16 percent increased risk of heart attack, while other heartburn medications were not. 20 \nThis short news video gives you an overview of the findings. Another study published by Stanford Medicine evaluated data from nearly 3 million people. It too found that those using PPIs were at higher risk of heart attacks. 21 \nFurther evidence exists that PPIs are associated with the development of chronic kidney disease . 22 One study evaluated over 10,000 users and found an association between chronic kidney disease and all users. There was a higher incidence in those who took the medications twice a day. \nResearchers from Houston Methodist Hospital may have discovered the reason why PPIs can affect the brain, kidneys and other systems. When different cells were grown in culture and exposed to PPIs, cells that line blood vessels demonstrated significant change. 23 PPIs are taken orally and affect the proton pump in more than just your stomach walls. \nBlood vessels also produce small amounts of acid in order to break down and eliminate damaged protein molecules. When acid levels drop, microscopic debris begins to build up on the arterial walls, and may result in particularly severe problems where many blood vessels are found, such as the brain, heart and kidneys. 24 Lead author Dr. John Cooke, chair of cardiovascular disease research at Houston Methodist Research Institute, commented: 25 \n\"I'm perplexed that the pharmaceutical industry didn't run across this first. This is something that should have been apparent a long time ago and should have been investigated.\" \nAn increased risk of fracture is attributed to an increase of gastrin in your stomach, inhibiting the absorption of calcium and thus altering the function of osteoclasts in your bone. 26 Data from nearly 80,000 women only added to the body of evidence that PPIs increase the risk of fracture, even after adjusting for body mass index, calcium intake and physical activity. 27 Researchers did discover the risk returned to normal after being off the drug for two years. \nReduction of gastric acid secretion is also associated with a vitamin B12 deficiency. This may lead to anemia, nerve damage, psychiatric problems and even dementia. Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in elderly people whose stomach naturally has reduced gastric acid secretion, but also in people who take medications, like PPIs, that reduce stomach acid. How to Properly Wean Yourself Off PPIs \nIn the above NPR interview a patient describes the rebound effect she experienced as she tried to stop taking a PPI. Although the medication does relieve symptoms, the side effects from the drug and the difficulty you may have discontinuing the medication make them a poor choice to treat GERD, indigestion or chronic heartburn. \nIf you have been using PPIs to manage heartburn, it's important to spend time detoxifying and eliminating the drug from your system. You should NEVER stop taking a PPI cold turkey. You have to wean yourself off them gradually or you'll experience a severe rebound called rebound acid hypersecretion, and the problem may end up being worse than before you started taking the medication. \nTo minimize your risk of rebound acid effects, gradually reduce the dose of PPI you're taking. Once you're down to the lowest dose, start substituting with an over-the-counter H2 blocker , like Cimetidine, Zantac, Raniditine or Tagamet. Once you've been taking the H2 blocker for a couple of weeks, you may start weaning yourself off these drugs as well, while introducing the alternative options to reduce your heartburn outlined below. Effective Alternatives to Treat Heartburn, GERD and Indigestion \nFortunately, there are alternatives that are both safe and effective. Since most people who suffer from reflux do not have an issue with too much acid, but rather with too little, or with a hiatal hernia, it is important to reduce any treatment that inhibits the production of acid. Remember, suppressing acid increases your risk for infection with H. pylori, a common cause of peptic ulcers with symptoms that closely mimic GERD. Before risking your health with medications, try these natural options \u2713 Address Your Diet \nThe answer to heartburn and acid indigestion is to restore your natural gastric balance and function. To do that, eat lots of vegetables and other high-quality, ideally organic, unprocessed foods, and make sure you're getting enough beneficial bacteria from your diet by regularly consuming fermented foods. \nThis will help balance your gut microbiome, which can help eliminate H. pylori bacteria \u2014 which is a common cause of heartburn \u2014 naturally. Research 28 also suggests sauerkraut or cabbage juice stimulates production of stomach acid. Another benefit is it can provide you with valuable bacteria to help balance and nourish your gut. \nHaving a few teaspoons of cabbage juice before eating, or fermented cabbage juice from sauerkraut, will do wonders to improve your digestion. Fresh raw cabbage juice can also be very useful to heal resistant ulcers. \u2713 Add Acid \nIt might seem counterintuitive to add acid to an acidic environment, but as you've already discovered, many cases of heartburn are triggered by low acid production. \nOne strategy is to take 3 teaspoons of raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar in 6 to 8 ounces of fresh water before each meal. 29 For a list of other alternatives that can help promote acid production, please see my previous article, \" 15 Natural Remedies for the Treatment of Acid Reflux .\" \u2713 Work With Gravity \nHeartburn tends to be worse at night, and/or after you lie down. Rather than lying down right after a meal, stay seated or standing for at least three hours, as food pressing on your lower esophageal sphincter (LES) will increase your risk of heartburn. Elevate the head of your bed using blocks sold for that purpose so your bed doesn't slip and cause injury. 30 \nAvoid stacking pillows to elevate your head, as this can increase pressure on your LES. High pillows also cause poor alignment of your neck and spine, increasing your risk for neck pain. \u2713 Ginger Root Tea \nGinger root has been traditionally used against gastric disturbances since ancient times. Its gastroprotective effect comes from blocking acid and suppressing H. pylori. To make your own tea, simmer three slices of raw ginger root in 2 cups of water for about 30 minutes. Drinking it 20 minutes before your meal can help prevent heartburn from developing. \u2713 Avoid Tight-Fitting Clothing \nTight clothing increases the pressure on your LES and increases the risk of an acid leak into your esophagus. \u2713 Maintain a Healthy Weight \nExcess weight around your middle places excess pressure on your LES. Even losing 15 pounds can make a positive difference in your symptoms. \u2713 Avoid Triggers \nFood allergies or triggers may also be a problem, so you'll want to completely eliminate items such as caffeine, alcohol and nicotine products. Track the foods that increase your personal risk of heartburn. It might take some time, but it is well worth the effort. \u2713 Organic Coconut Oil \nCoconut oil is a natural antibacterial, helping to reduce any overgrowth of bacteria in your stomach. It also helps to soothe your esophagus on the way down, and is a very healthy fat that is good for your overall health. \nStart with 1 teaspoon to see how your body responds. Common side effects are headache and slight nausea. Gradually work up to 3 tablespoons a day. You could also try adding 1 tablespoon to a cup of tea or coffee. 0",

                              "text": "How BPA and BPS Are Making People Sick February 22, 2017 | 2,851 views Please 0 \nBy Dr. Mercola \nJust when you thought you knew how dangerous bisphenol-A (BPA) was to your health, research demonstrates both BPA and substitute chemicals are able to cross the placental barrier, increasing the toxic load on a growing infant. 1 When tested, over 200 chemicals were found in umbilical cord blood of newborns. 2 \nFirst created in 1891 by a Russian chemist, BPA didn't make an appearance in the manufacture of products until the 1950s, when it was used to produce resilient, and often transparent plastics. \nDespite strong scientific evidence that BPA has a negative effect on health, the industry was valued at over $13 billion in 2013, and is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. 3 \nToday, BPA is found in countless personal care and plastic products, from the lining in canned goods to plastic wraps, water bottles and cashier receipts. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claims BPA is safe for human consumption, it has been banned from sippy cups and other baby products. \nUnfortunately, substitute chemicals being used to increase the strength and resiliency of plastics are probably no safer than the BPA they replaced, as they are near-identical chemical compounds. BPA and BPS Cross the Placental Barrier Increasing Risk to Children \nIn 2010 researchers discovered BPA does cross the placental barrier. 4 , 5 But, more importantly, the researchers found while the active form of BPA stays active in the developing infant, the inactive form can be converted to an active form, indicating pre-birth exposure to BPA was greater than originally anticipated. \nIn the movement toward removal of BPA from products, manufacturers have been using bisphenol-S (BPS) and bisphenol-F (BPF) instead. These substitute chemicals are as hormonally active as BPA and are both strong endocrine disruptors. 6 Both demonstrate adverse effects on the physiological functioning of humans and rats. 7 \nCanadian and Chinese scientists have now demonstrated what environmentalists have long believed \u2014 BPS and BPA can both cross into the placenta, affecting the pre-birth growth of infants. 8 BPS had already been found in urine samples of over 80 percent of infants from China, U.S. and six other Asian countries. 9 \nPrevious studies had reported behavioral differences in rodent mothers exposed to BPS during pregnancy and in their female offspring. \nThe most recent study measured levels of BPS and BPA in 61 pairs of maternal and cord blood samples, proving \"the first evidence that BPS crosses the human placenta.\" 10 BPA metabolites in cord blood were also higher than found in maternal blood. \nCurrent biomonitoring usually relies on detection of total BPA in the urine and not the metabolites, BPA-sulfate and BPA-glucuronide. Monitoring metabolites of BPA is limited and even less is known about the metabolites of substitutes BPS and BPF. Lead author Dr. Jonathan Martin from the University of Alberta explained: \n\"The [fetus] has more difficulty excreting BPA than the mother. The mother can easily pass metabolites through urine, whereas the [fetus] excretes to the amniotic fluid and, to some extent, back to the mother's circulation. The human [fetus] is known to have a different metabolic capacity. \nIt's known to have a very immature glucuronidation pathway, whereas sulfation begins earlier. So it's not uncommon for the human [fetus] to produce more of the sulfate than the respective glucuronide.\" How Endocrine Disruption Works \nBPA metabolites may not have the strong estrogenic chemical activity of total BPA, but they are also not biologically inactive. Several studies have identified different types of biological activity between cultured cells and one BPA metabolite, and total BPA is a known endocrine disruptor. \nThrough widespread exposure and multiple effects on human cells, BPA represents a complex risk to human health. 11 Exposure to rodents in the perinatal period, during the weeks just prior to and after birth, BPA had a significant effect on the neuroendocrine stress response. 12 \nResearchers theorized this exposure may be associated with the development of stress-related disorders later in life. Endocrine disruptors work by mimicking, or partially mimicking, hormones that occur naturally in the human body. This may produce overstimulation. \nSome interfere or block the way receptors or hormones are made or controlled. This interruption in the endocrine system may produce negative results in infant development or in the reproductive, neurological and immune systems of children and adults. \nThere is a wide range of chemicals and substances that may cause endocrine disruption , of which bisphenol chemicals are only one. \nPesticides, pharmaceutical interventions, dioxin-like compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls are just a few of these endocrine disruptors that are found in products, water supply and food supply affecting your health. \nAccording to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), research demonstrates these endocrine disruptors carry the greatest risk when humans are exposed during prenatal and early childhood development. 13 This is the point during which organ and neurological system formation is being completed. Increases Long-Term Risk of Illness and Adds Billions to Healthcare Cost \nWhile exposure during prenatal and infancy periods may hold the greatest risk, adolescents and adults are also at risk from endocrine disruptors and the subsequent health conditions that may develop. \nA recent study of the healthcare cost impact in Europe demonstrated endocrine disrupting chemical contributed to the development of disease and illness. 14 \nThe study found the subsequent health care cost from only the chemicals with the highest probability of causation resulted in a cost of at least $175 billion each year. The researchers estimated a broader analysis would have resulted in a greater burden of disease and healthcare cost. \nThe research detailed costs related to obesity , neurological disorders, and male reproductive disorders. The study evaluated the effect of only 5 percent of the known endocrine disruptors, making this only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Linda Birnbaum, Ph.D., microbiologist and director of the NIEHS, commented: 15 \n\"The point is that there is a wide variety of effects being seen in the general population related to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We have increasing amount of data raising concerns about their use. We are seeing effects from [chemical] levels that are present in the general population.\" \nAs your endocrine system is instrumental in regulating mood, growth and development, tissue function, metabolism, as well as sexual function and reproductive processes, it is not surprising BPA and substitute chemicals are associated with a number of different health conditions, including: \n\u2713 Structural damage to your brain; hyperactivity, increased aggressiveness and impaired learning \n\u2713 Early puberty, stimulation of mammary gland development, disrupted reproductive cycles, ovarian toxicity and infertility 16 \n\u2713 High blood pressure and heart disease 18 , 19 , 20 \n\u2713 Increased fat formation and risk of obesity \n\u2713 Increased prostate size, decreased sperm production, hypospadias (penis deformation), 21 erectile dysfunction 22 and stimulation of prostate cancer cells \n\u2713 Altered immune function \n\u2713 Reduced efficacy of chemotherapy treatment 24 BPA and Substitutes Increase Your Risk of Obesity and Diabetes \nAs obesity is a primary factor in the development of many of the health conditions listed above, it is important to note that nearly 67 percent of women and 75 percent of men are either overweight or obese today. 25 These numbers represent a rising trend and significant public health risk. \nWhile it is tempting to blame an increasing waistline on one or two factors, metabolism and weight control is complex and is dependent on different influences. In a recent study, researchers discovered that in order to maintain the same weight in 2006 as in 1988 you would have to eat less and exercise more. 26 \nThe logical conclusion is that an environmental factor more prevalent after 1988 is influencing your metabolism. Research from Health Canada demonstrated the human body doesn't safely metabolize and excrete BPA, but instead transforms it into something that grows fat cells. 27 This confirmed the results of multiple past studies linking BPA to increasing obesity. 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 \nOne study was also able to demonstrate BPA not only increased the number of fat cells that differentiate from pre-adiposity cells, but also increased the amount of fat inside the cells. 32 \nRecent research now demonstrates the nearly identical BPS has some of the same characteristics. Interestingly, in this study, all cells exposed to BPS created fat, but those exposed to the least and greatest amount grew greater amounts of fat than those exposed to moderate amounts. 33 Senior author of the latest study on BPS, Ella Atlas, Ph.D., of Health Canada, commented on the results, saying: 34 \n\"Our research indicates BPS and BPA have comparable effects on fat cells and their metabolism. The study is the first to show that BPS exposure can induce the formation of human fat cells. \nSince BPS is one of the replacement chemicals used in consumer products that are marketed as BPA-free, it is important to examine whether BPS acts as an endocrine-disrupting chemical. This study shows that BPS and BPA have similar effects on fat cell formation, lipid accumulation and expression of genes important for lipid metabolism.\" Is 'BPA-Free' Meaningless? \nConcerns about the health effects of BPA have caused many consumers to seek out products that are BPA-free. However, research indicates the substitute compounds used to increase the strength of plastics also interfere with hormones and pose a public health risk. In a study evaluating the risks of both BPS and a secondary substitute chemical, BPF, researchers concluded they are both as hormonally active as BPA. 35 \nThe structure between these three chemicals are remarkably similar, they provide the same stability to plastics and create similar health risks to humans. 36 Study author Johanna Rochester, Ph.D., researcher at the Endocrine Disruption Exchange, commented: 37 \n\"According to pretty much all the literature there is on these two substitutes, they are hormonally active in ways similar to BPA \u2014 similar mechanisms, similar potencies.\" \nProducts labeled \"BPA-free\" have also been found to leach chemicals with estrogenic activity after undergoing real world testing. Plastics labeled \"BPA-free\" were microwaved, exposed to ultraviolet lights and other common stressors. 38 Almost all the commercially available products tested released chemicals with estrogenic activity, including those labeled \"BPA-free.\" \nThe researchers pointed out that manufacturers now have the ability to produce plastics without estrogenically active compounds in a cost-effective manner that would significantly reduce public health risks. 39 So why don't they? Take These Steps to Reduce Your Risk \nBPA is used in an amazing number of products in your home. In this short video, results from a study on canned foods is described. As it turns out, the researchers found more than just BPA. Until manufacturers place a higher value on human health than on profit, consider taking these steps to reduce your exposure to BPA and all the substitute compounds that also contain endocrine disrupting features. 40 , 41 , 42 \u2713 Eat Mostly Fresh Whole Foods \nProcessed and packaged foods are a common source of BPA and phthalates \u2014 particularly cans, but also foods packaged in plastic wrap. Real food is always your best option. \u2713 Buy and Use Glass \nBuy products that come in glass bottles rather than plastic or cans. Store your food and beverages in glass and use glass containers if heating food in your microwave, as heat tends to increase the release of chemicals from plastic. Be aware that even BPA-free plastics typically leach other endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are just as bad as BPA. \nUse glass baby bottles for your infants. Never drink coffee or tea from plastic cups and replace all your plastic cups with glass. Avoid plastic utensil and don't use drinking water packaged in plastic. Filter your own water and store it in glass containers. Don't use plastic grocery bags from the store. Bring your own reusable canvas or cloth variety. \u2713 Avoid Plastic Wrap \nIf you are using it to cover a glass container, don't allow it to touch the food and don't use it in the microwave . \u2713 Be Careful with Cash Register Receipts \nIf you use a store regularly, encourage the management to switch to BPA-free receipts. I shop at Publix for my food and when I called them about the receipts it turns out they had already switched. Nevertheless, it is wise to limit your contact with all these receipts. \u2713 Use Sustainable, Certified Organic, GMO-free Products \nLook for products that are earth-friendly, animal-friendly, sustainable, certified organic and GMO-free . This applies to everything from food and personal care products to building materials, carpeting, paint, baby items, furniture, mattresses and more. \nWhen redoing your home, look for \"green,\" toxin-free alternatives in lieu of regular paint and vinyl floor coverings, the latter of which is another source of phthalates . Replace your vinyl shower curtain with a fabric one. Don't use non-stick cookware. \u2713 Choose Children's Toys Carefully \nChoose toys made from natural materials to avoid plastic chemicals like phthalates and BPA/BPS, particularly for items your child may be prone to suck or chew on. \u2713 Breastfeed for at Least a Year \nBreastfeed your baby exclusively if possible, for at least the first year (as you will avoid phthalates exposure from infant formula packaging and plastic bottles/nipples). Breastfeeding has additional advantages for your child as well. \u2713 Avoid Manufactured Cleaning Products \nUse natural cleaning products , or make your own. You can clean most of your home with white vinegar and baking soda. There are options for dryer sheets and fabric softeners . \u2713 Switch to Organic Toiletries \nSwitch over to organic toiletries, including shampoo, toothpaste, antiperspirants and cosmetics. EWG's Skin Deep database can help you find personal care products that are free of phthalates and other potentially dangerous chemicals. 43 \u2713 Switch Feminine Hygiene and Urinary Incontinence Products \nReplace feminine hygiene products (tampons and sanitary pads) and urinary incontinence products with safer alternatives. While most ingredients in feminine hygiene products are undisclosed, tests suggest they may contain dioxins and petrochemical additives. \u2713 Opt for Fragrance-Free \nLook for fragrance-free products; phthalates are often used to help the product hold its fragrance longer. Artificial fragrance can also contain dozens of potentially toxic chemicals. Avoid fabric softeners, dryer sheets, air fresheners and scented candles for the same reason. \u2713 Test Tap Water \nCheck your home's tap water for contaminants and filter the water if necessary. You may also want to use an alternative to PVC pipes for your water supply. \u2713 Don't Drink From the Hose \nTeach your children not to drink water from the garden hose, as many are made with phthalate-containing plastics. \u2713 Check with the Dentist \nVerify any dental sealant used is BPA-, BPS- and BPF-free 0 [+] Sources and References",

Downing a dose, he said: \"I will be the first to drink this today, in front of you, to show you that this product cures and does not kill.\" The drink, which has been called Covid-Organics, is derived from artemisia -- a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment -- and other indigenous herbs, according to the IMRA. But its safety and effectiveness have not been assessed internationally, nor has any data from trials been published in peer-reviewed studies. Mainstream scientists have warned of the potential risk from untested herbal brews. Rajoelina brushed aside any such reservations and said the concoction would be offered to schoolchildren, as it was his duty was to \"protect the Malagasy people\". \"Covid-Organics will be used as prophylaxis, that is for prevention, but clinical observations have shown a trend towards its effectiveness in curative treatment,\" said Dr. Charles Andrianjara, IMRA's director general. The large Indian Ocean island has so far detected 121 cases and no fatality. The pandemic has triggered a rush for herbal formulas, lemons and ginger in the belief that they can protect against the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO), which has people to be vigilant about claimed cures for COVID-19, did not attend the event. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), referring to claims for herbal or tea remedies, says: \"There is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness caused by COVID-19. In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume.\" \u00a9 2020 AFP",

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors. Fake and bogus cure claims are a longstanding, but neglected public health problem. Throughout recorded history, plagues have inspired anxiety and desperation. Time and again, this public nervousness has proved a fertile ground for false cures and claimants to thrive. In this sense, recent claims of COVID-19 cures and antidotes are no exception. During the Spanish flu, cure claims generated a false sense of safety that drove hundreds to defy closures and isolation. In the US, scores of bogus remedies alleging to cure the flu were sold under upbeat labels that undermined preventive action. One ad boasted: When Vick\u2019s VapoRub is applied over the throat and chest, the medicated vapors loosen the phlegm, open the air passages and stimulate the mucus membrane to throw off the germs. Fake and bogus cures caused the death of many as HIV swept around the world. In Nigeria, for instance, as early as the 1990s, Jeremiah Abalaka, a surgeon with fringe training in immunology, startled the world with his HIV cure claim. Many of the HIV patients who flocked to his private clinic reportedly died, including dozens of soldiers referred for treatment by the Nigerian government. More recently, during both the Ebola and SARS epidemics, fake cure claims also circulated freely, with lethal consequences. For example, salt solution, snake venom, vitamin C, Nano Silver and some herbs were all touted as cures for Ebola. At least two people died in Nigeria and about 20 more were hospitalised after drinking excessive amounts of salt solution to prevent Ebola infection. Sadly, history is repeating itself in the context of COVID-19. False claims range from US president Donald Trump\u2019s touting of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure to Madagascar\u2019s herbal \u201ccure\u201d promoted by President Andry Rajoelina. In Ghana, a Pentecostal pastor launched and sold \u201cCoronavirus Oil\u201d, telling a packed church that it was effective against COVID-19. An American pastor also recently directed viewers to buy Optivida Silver Solution to prevent COVID-19. Its promoter had falsely claimed that the product was government-approved and has the ability to kill every pathogen it has ever been tested on, including SARS and HIV. With growing global anxiety, many people are easy targets for cure scams and hucksters. Victims of fake cure claims are often among the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable. Fighting these cure claims is integral to containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Authorities across the world are working hard to ensure that correct information and messages on the pandemic reach everybody. But there is room to do more. Why we must act now Cure claims are dangerous. They delay treatment-seeking and promote reckless behaviour that may result in deaths. At least 300 Iranians have died from methanol poisoning after consuming alcohol to prevent COVID-19. Hours after Trump declared hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure for COVID-19, people overdosed on it in Africa and Asia. In Arizona, a man died after reportedly treating himself with a COVID-19 home therapy derived from the same anti-malarial drug that the US president touted as a wonder drug. Health literacy \u2013 the ability of patients to read, comprehend and act on medical instructions \u2013 remains weak in many contexts. Several millions of health-seekers around the world rely on informal or inexpert sources for their health information needs. Hard-to-reach and vulnerable groups and communities must be targeted through bespoke health promotion strategies. Online and traditional media offer immense potential to intensify public health education. They must maintain vigilance on COVID-19 cure scams and claimants as they emerge in diverse forms and places. However, merely identifying bogus COVID-19 cure claims or alerting the public about them is no longer enough. Targeted seizure and destruction of unproven cures can deliver important results. In 2015, a global crackdown by Interpol seized nearly 21 million fake and illegal drugs, including fake cancer \u201ccures\u201d. Governments must also implement community health outreach programmes that communicate clearly and accurately. Such programmes should have fit-for-purpose feedback systems to enable lay persons in multiple contexts to raise concerns, ask questions and swiftly receive answers. One size will not fit all at this time. Part of the success recorded in Nigeria during the Ebola outbreak has been attributed to the use of different media, including government-sponsored TV and radio messages, town-criers, social media campaigns, and experts to communicate health information to its citizens. Countries and national health bodies must integrate traditional healers, faith leaders and community principals in their COVID-19 response strategies. Several studies have documented proven strategies for effectively engaging lay and faith healers to offer correct support and information on epidemics. This is the time to bring these strategies to scale. Robust mechanisms for holding scam COVID-19 cure claimants and hucksters accountable are also urgently needed. Currently, few countries have such mechanisms. But a good precedent exists in Australia, where a \u201chealing church\u201d that touted a bleach-based solution as a COVID-19 cure has been fined more than $150,000.
