Without mentioning that our satire was a hyperbolic buildup on his own recent writings, Zakaria cries for government protection of his hurt feelings, making it clear that he can dish it out but can't take it. Taste your own medicine, Fareed.\"Progressives\" have trolled, ridiculed, satirized, maligned, insulted, bullied, and lied about conservatives since the inception of the Internet. But once they see the signs of oncoming traffic, they cry and run to mommy - or to the nanny state in this case - asking to make it a one-way street once again, where only they can ride their tricycles, wear funny hats, and fling poop at those whom they consider inferiors. Watch Fareed Zakaria on camera wiping his face from the poop flung at him. An open letter to Fareed Zakaria from The People's Cube ~ Dear Fareed,There have been studies showing that a foreign-born author's unique perspective can help the natives to boost their own creative thinking through the so-called \"schema violation,\" which occurs when our world is turned upside-down. You may argue that your \"otherness\" benefits and enlightens this country, with an implication that those unwilling to be enlightened by you are bigots who resent your \"otherness\" and won't have their old schema to be violated by a newcomer. Like you, I am a foreign-born author whose English is a second, or, rather, a third language; I know what it feels to be \"the other.\" I also like to help the natives to boost their creative thinking by turning their reality upside-down and sending their temporal and spatial cues off-kilter (my website, The People's Cube , is one such big schema violation). I don't resent anyone's \"otherness\" as long as they don't attempt to make me comply to theirs. In sum, I am not concerned with your ethnic or cultural \"otherness.\" It is your ideological \"otherness\" that bothers me, which makes you indistinguishable from the next run-of-the-mill, native-born \"progressive.\"Now that we got the implication of bigotry out of the way, let's get down to business.On January 2, one of our contributors posted a satirical response to your Washington Post article where you apparently gloated over the premature deaths of white males in America. Our author took your argument to its logical conclusion, adding the need to exterminate white females as well - through Jihad, rape, and sex slavery as recently seen in Europe and elsewhere. This parody wasn't meant to be taken as factual reporting, given the context of our website and especially considering the author's credentials at the top: Chedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth.On January 14, you responded to our satire in your Washington Post article titled, Bile, venom and lies: How I was trolled on the Internet , and today you started your show on CNN with a segment titled, Fareed's Take: I was the target of Internet trolling , in which you were mostly reading your earlier article from the teleprompter. Among other things you claimed that our story \"was cleverly written to provide conspiracy theorists with enough ammunition to ignore evidence\" and complained that some people took our \"reporting\" seriously and reposted it in social media with impolite comments, all of which led you to conclude that someone must create a mechanism in social media \"to distinguish between fact and falsehood.\" And since that someone can only be the government, your statement can only be understood as a vague call for the government censorship of the Internet.However, neither your article, nor the CNN segment mentioned that our grotesque fiction was based on your own controversial ideas that many Americans found insulting and grotesque. Why? Was it because such an admission would have undermined your argument that people were angry at you over nothing? And why in the world, Fareed, did you decide to bring up the term \"radicalization,\" which in today's world is mostly associated with Islam? Do you have such a tin ear - or do you really think that if you broaden the definition and talk about \"American radicalization,\" people will begin to see the two as morally equivalent? Do you think they are morally equivalent, Fareed?Fine, let's talk about radicalization.For you, sitting on the top floors of your well-protected media establishment's ivory tower, it's easy to downplay the threat of Islamic radicalization and throw the \"Islamophobia\" labels at all those little people down at the street level. The only radicalization to which your skewed radar is attuned is the faintest sound of protest from the little people, when they get fed up with your condescending elitism and begin to rebel against the \"progressive\" establishment. That's what scares you the most, doesn't it, Fareed? That's when you mouth off your grave concerns on CNN and write in WaPo about the threat of radicalization. But who is at fault that Americans no longer trust the establishment and its media? Have you considered the possibility that none of this would be happening if you and your colleagues weren't so radical yourselves, feeding the people with half-truths, distortions, propaganda, and outright lies, placing your Utopian \"progressive\" ideology above facts, smug and secure in your impenetrable media castle? Did it occur to you that you and your media establishment may be the very reason why so many people suddenly like Donald Trump, whom you so despise , and nothing you say on the subject can change their minds because no one trusts you anymore?When you talked about a study where \"simply by talking to one another, the bigoted students had become more bigoted,\" has it even occurred to you how perfectly this describes your \"progressive\" echo chamber, where tolerance towards opposing philosophical viewpoints is nonexistent? If you think that calling those who disagree with you \"bigots\" makes you an anti-bigot, let me share a little secret. There are two kinds of bigots today: the bigots and the anti-bigots, and it's hard to say which kind is worse. A good example of \"group polarization\" involving radical \"anti-bigots\" is JournoList - a highly biased group of about 400 left-wing journalists and political activists who for three years (2007-2010) participated in a private online echo chamber where they, in violation of public trust and professional ethics, conspired to coordinate media attacks on conservatives, to promote certain issues while burying others, and to influence the 2008 elections in favor of Barack Obama. To paraphrase Kolbert's study, \"Simply by talking to one another, the radical left-wing journalists had become more radical left-wing journalists.\" To use your exact quote, \"It is how radicalization happens and extremism spreads.\" Say, were you just as worried about \"group polarization\" then as you are now?Another example of such \"group polarization\" and radicalization is a knee-jerk impulse of allegedly mainstream journalists to describe anyone who doesn't lean left as \"far-right,\" as you have demonstrated in your CNN segment, or \"ultra-right-wing,\" as you have demonstrated in your segment.Isn't it a little too late to complain about America's radicalization, Fareed? Where were you during the George W. Bush years, when your fellow \"progressives\" trolled, ridiculed, and slandered the U.S. President and his supporters, with full support of the mainstream media? When there no longer was any distinction between a drug-fueled street protester and a media commentator? Did you complain when \"progressive\" satirists collectively created a false, hyperbolic reality around Bush, conservatives, Fox News, and America in general, which was then regularly disseminated as the truth around the world, translated into many languages, and contributing to the anti-American sentiment? Some of my own family members in Russia and Ukraine still honestly believe that those \"facts\" really happened. As you so eloquently stated,\" the people spreading this story were not interested in the facts; they were interested in feeding prejudice.\" Did you complain then, or did it feel too good to let go?You refer to a scientific study of Facebook users, which found that \"people mainly shared information that confirmed their prejudices, paying little attention to facts and veracity.\" That sounds reasonable. For example, even without a scientific study I know that an overwhelming majority of your fellow \"progressives\" believe that Sarah Palin has actually said \"I can see Russia from my house,\" paying little attention to the fact that it originated as an SNL skit. Did you complain about that in 2008? Were you at all concerned that Tina Fey's \"Palin\" videos might confuse voters and skew the election? Probably not; it was just satirical hyperbole, right?What if social media encourage misinformation, rumors, and lies, you ask. But did you ask the same question when misinformation, rumors, and lies were coming not from social media but from a seasoned mainstream journalist named Dan Rather - or, more recently, The Rolling Stone Magazine? Or, worse yet, from the nation's political leaders whom you support and admire? Wasn't the entire debate on and implementation of ObamaCare based on misinformation and lies? Were you alarmed when Joe Biden told a black audience that the Republicans would put them back in chains? Did you speak against radicalization when the \"hands up don't shoot\" movement, based on misinformation, rumors, and lies, and encouraged by the mainstream media, resulted in looting and the destruction of property, followed by the murders of innocent police officers?The answer to all those question is \"no.\" You have never violated the \"progressive\" schema, Fareed. You've been a loyal Party soldier, albeit a mediocre creative thinker, having traded your \"otherness\" for conformity and sacrificing your unique perspective to what you thought was \"progress.\"Examples are plenty; more can be provided upon request. Now let's talk about victimhood. You say you are the victim because you have received some hateful messages and comments. I have also received many hateful messages and comments from your fellow \"progressives\" over the years. Now what? You claim you have received a late-night phone call that woke up and threatened your young daughters. Indeed, Fareed, making threatening calls is a crime. Did you file a police report? Did the police trace the number and find the perpetrators, who are hardly a sophisticated organization behind an impenetrable firewall? If not, I can't believe every claim that comes from a confirmed plagiarist . You may as well claim that someone kicked your three-legged puppy and it made you cry.\ufeffWhile you played the world's saddest song on the world's smallest violin, I was the one who took the real hit. Snopes.com, a \"fact-checking\" website rooting for the \"progressive\" team, has not only debunked our satire as they've done it many times in the past - this time they also made an unsourced and slanderous allegation that our site is \"known for spreading malware.\"Next, some busybody contacted one of our advertising providers, Content.ad, which then declined to pay our advertising earnings due to \"serious quality issues.\" The money we lost as a result may be small change compared to your CNN contract, but if you were penalized for your writings in the same proportional amount, I'm sure your righteous indignation would go well beyond just one article in WaPo and a five-minute segment on CNN. There is only one victim of lies, prejudice, and institutionalized bias here - and it ain't you, Fareed. But don't let this stop you from playing your upside-down game of \"victims and radicals\" while you still can. So you think your opponents are radicals? Here's a news tip: down here in the streets below you, it's the other way around: growing numbers of Americans see you and your media colleagues as radical ideological hacks. You can call them any name you want, adding ultra-, far-, uber-, and other hyphenated insults; that won't change the fact that their thinking is the norm and yours is not. Like all normal people on this planet, they don't respond well to insults. But they are also the ones who make sure you have the freedom to call them radicals. Oleg AtbashianDepartment of Visual Agitation and Unanimity 1/18/2016, 1:27 am Red Square,I must say, this morning when I heard Fareed refer to TPC as a \"minor news site\" I was terribly offended and had to be hospitalized for a number of hours. Fortunately there was no permanent brain damage or anything so I can resume spewing hate tomorrow morning. (according to my doctor) I look forward to reading your upcoming letter to the sensitive Mr. Zakaria when my health returns in the spring.CC 1/18/2016, 3:12 am Alright, so Zakaria said that it is not obvious that this is a satire page to paraphrase. Yet the Washington Post declared us as \" Arguably one of the Internet's most satirical websites \". And if THAT isn't enough maybe the author, a cheeto dressed as Che Guevara, might have been another dead give away Might have....Really this whole thing reminded me of a clip I've seen from another satirical source... Although it 'may not' be 'clear satire' if we were to use the racist plagiarist Fareed Zakaria's standards. It's not about Zakaria, and the subject matter may be different, but mechanically he did the same thing.... He can use Craptek's Safer-Space \u2122 Products . 1/18/2016, 10:43 am Kongratulations, Komrade Red Square! Your People's Truth finally penetrated Fareed the Screed's bubble of Bleeding Edge Korrect Truth! Perhaps I can be allowed to suggest to the Cubitburo that you be awarded the title, \"People's Needler\" for that penetration, and also\"Onion of the Soviet Cube\" for having made him cry like a little girl. 1/18/2016, 4:24 pm Sounds like Fareed really, really wants to be on the cover of the next issue of Poor Me. Instead of bringing back Beet of the Week (thanks to Speaker Ryan, it might well be fully funded again since he moved to fully fund pretty much everything else), perhaps we should implement something called Whiner of the Week and make Fareed the first recipient. Fareed had to read the article from a teleprompter because someone else probably wrote it. 1/18/2016, 4:49 pm Commissarka Pinkie Sounds like Fareed really, really wants to be on the cover of the next issue of Poor Me. Instead of bringing back Beet of the Week (thanks to Speaker Ryan, it might well be fully funded again since he moved to fully fund pretty much everything else), perhaps we should implement something called Whiner of the Week and make Fareed the first recipient. Thank you for reminding me! I'll get to making the second issue of Poor Me Magazine right away. Preparing Whiner of the Week award is a bit more complicated, as I foresee a lot of red tape, hurdles, signatures, bribes, and entertainment expenses before it is even included in this Five-Year Plan. In lieu of that, let me use the existing Golden Teabag award and sticker: If he was smarter, he'd just turn the other cheek.

You won't find 'em anywhere else. Only on the People's Cube, comrade! Only on the People's Cube. This clowns tears look more like that of an entirely different body fluid. Are we sure he's not a bukkake(don't google, you've been warned) enthusiast? Komrade Victor - are you implying that Fareed is \"wee-wee'd up\" (to use a phrase first uttered by The Most High and Mighty Barack H Obama)? My Our Entire Beet Kollecktiv has ( Unanimously! ) voted to send Kameradka Zakaria An Entire Pallet Of Teenage-Girl-Sized Feminine Hygiene Pads .

Commie fight! 1/19/2016, 2:52 am Fareed Zakaria shown above accepting his Proletariat Peabody Award (more commonly known as the HUA Award) from The People's Cube for \"Outstanding Heads-Up Asininity\" in Progressively projecting onto those \"others\" his own heart-felt bigotry in a manner portraying himself as victim -- i.e., as the bigotee rather than the bigotor. Next on his target list is The Onion, Mad Magazine, and other libelously parodic and satirical mockers of well-deserved mockees. Response to 3min mark: Woh! This is a satire website??? So does that mean Laika the space dog is NOT a real reporter??? I just...I just don't know what to believe anymore! 1/19/2016, 9:35 am after a single mention by Rush Limbaugh, the \"Stalinist version of the Onion\" the Peoples Cube was overwhelmed with visits and new members...Given the ratings and the audience of CNN, has there been any spike in viewers to the cube? perhaps we can get someone to stand on a corner and hand out flyers? I can go back to writing the website on the walls of the ladies room stalls... (you meet the nicest people in there)Viva la Clinton News Network!FLOORWARD! 1/19/2016, 3:14 pm Comrade Square, your written response was way beyond masterful, there is however one minor problem. The entire article will have to be reduced to a collection of single syllable words by the CNN editorial staff, so their \"on camera personalities\" may absorb some of the meaning.Concerning the proletariat award, I am sure that any resemblance to the Debby Washerwoman is purely coincidental. 1/20/2016, 12:59 am Comrade Trump has gone beyond an amusing cartoon to the party. Now the gloves must come off for this threat comrades. Books, banners, T-shirts and hats will be burned, neighbors will be shamed in the streets, and any white subversive sympathizer will be reeducated in the Eastern camps at hard labor to appreciate third world values, food and dance. Zero toleration for any leftover capitalist pigs in the USA! The comments on Fareed's article are pretty awesome... On special request from Commisarka Pinkie: Poor Me Mag #2 | See #1 here .

Never mind. I forgot that the first issue was about a gay man who was upset that he was gay and other people were not. 1/21/2016, 4:48 pm If there is a story in deaf as a Post, there could be something to this.CNN as confident [ this is mean he is a good plagiarist] that any of his text may have come from not copyrighted sources.Will he be Fareed from employment? Probably not, CNN loves originality, even if it is somebody else's. General Confusion Comrade Square, your written response was way beyond masterful , there is however one minor problem. The entire article will have to be reduced to a collection of single syllable words by the CNN editorial staff, so their \"on camera personalities\" may absorb some of the meaning.Concerning the proletariat award, I am sure that any resemblance to the Debby Washerwoman is purely coincidental. Yes! Yes! Yes! Comrade General Confusion!I just have to sit down and take it in. Awesome! So awesome! That is the finest use of English by anyone in the cube, or out including myself!There should be an appropriate award by members, you can head a committee!GC General Confusion Comrade Pamalinsky,That is the finest use of English by anyone in the cube, or out including myself!There should be an appropriate award by members, you can head a committee!GC Thanks, General Confusion, for your kind words. Thing is, I had to dry the tears dripping down my cheeks after reading it. I am so proud to be a Cubist (an art form) Poor Fareed, his skin is so thin that when the wind blows he calls it an extremist racist troll that offends him. 1/21/2016, 10:15 pm Komrade Direktor, how dare you say these hateful words of oppression towards Mr. Zakaria! I know he attacked our Glorious Kube, but he's clearly Muslim or related to Muslims (Judging by the Glorious Muslim name), which makes him a part of the Protekted Peoples of the Kubist Way. That means that you can't attack him. He is rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off of him and sticks on you. Anyways, the Kube is Eternal and Glorious, the attacks of someone like him can't damage it. Where there is Kommunism, there is the Kube, and as long as there is one person alive that is dedicated to the Eternally True Kommunist Way, then the Kube will live on. And Zakaria is actually helping the Kube, he is letting people know of it's existence, and once you have the Kube on your mind it won't go away. I thought I was immune to the Allure of the Kube since 2009 when I started reading it. That was until I decided to become a part of the Revolution and enlist in the People's Kubist Revolutionary Force.Besides, our Glorious Party Organ isn't satire, it's Eternal Current Truth! Laika lives on, she will never die! I get all my news from the Kube, it tells me what to think, since I can't actually think for myself anymore. I used to, but then I was revolutionized by the Kube. Can you say that about such satire websites as MSNBC, Fox News, or indeed CNN, the very organization that Zakaria thinks is credible and reputable? They're as credible as a man saying a stick is actually a brick! Sure, these Organs of the Enemy do tell people what to think since they can't think for themselves, and they CAN revolutionize somebody, but they all believe in \"rights\". Komrade, there is only one right I believe in, and that is the right to work for the state in glorious production! And they also believe in \"ethics\" and \"Honesty\". Well, if that were the case, why are they spreading so many lies about the Kube? And why do they think they have to ask everybody questions that can easily be answered by a simple NSA scan or FBI/DHS/DEA raid? That's what makes our and many other Party Organs so great, we can and do get right to the source WITHOUT the overhead![OFF]Were this a lecture hall, I would have given a standing ovation for the letter to Zakaria. 1/25/2016, 10:22 pm methadras Poor Fareed, his skin is so thin that when the wind blows he calls it an extremist racist troll that offends him. I tend to find the passing wind somewhat offensive. I'm not sure if it's racist though. Likely a climate denier. I'm sure of that! It denies me my comfortable climate! 4/3/2016, 11:37 pm This story is now being discussed in Sweden. I accidentally noticed a popular link leading to the Cube, and clicking on it resulted in a Swedish news portal. Google Chrome offers a more or less readable translation - the style is lost, but the content is quite good. Very well stated. Thanks for being here, Komrade.

Yeah, mi, it reminds me of the time when Robert Redford announced his retirement (first in a series) in a video, and some commenter said, and I paraphrase, \"Whew, for a minute there I thought I was watching my bulldog's ballsack.

                              "text": "\"Some chain e-mails remind us of a bad  Three's Company  episode. One roommate overhears something a little wrong and leaps to all sorts of misguided conclusions. Hijinks ensue. The  latest chain e-mail  sent to us from a reader puts some words into the mouth of former Sen. Tom Daschle that raised our eyebrows. Daschle, you may recall, was once President Barack Obama's choice to be secretary of health and human services. He stepped down from consideration amid revelations about tax problems, but some think his fingerprints can be seen in some of the health provisions in the economic stimulus package signed by the president in February. According to the e-mail (read the  full text here  ), Daschle was quoted in a Bloomberg story saying, \"\"Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them.\"\" We thought that sounded a bit impolitic, and fairly callous, for a former senator to say, and so we decided to check it out. As with most e-mail claims, it starts with a grain of something. Bloomberg did run a story about health provisions in the stimulus package on Feb. 9, 2009, under the headline  \"\"Ruin Your Health With the Obama Stimulus Plan: Betsy McCaughey.\"\" It was a commentary piece written by  Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York and an adjunct senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. McCaughey warned that the stimulus included several troublesome provisions identical to ideas outlined by Daschle in his 2008 book,  Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis. Midway through the article, McCaughey includes this paragraph: \"\"Daschle says health care reform 'will not be pain-free.' Seniors should be more accepting\u00a0of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. That means the elderly will bear the brunt.\"\" We contacted McCaughey to see which parts of this were her words and which were Daschle's. The phrase that health care reform \"\"will not be pain-free\"\" is a direct quote from Daschle, she explained. She said the sentence beginning \"\"Seniors should be more accepting\"\" was her paraphrasing of an argument in Daschle's book in which he quotes David Mechanic, a health care policy expert at Rutgers University, saying, \"\"more and more of what were once seen as social, behavioral, or normative aspects of every day life, or as a normal process of aging, are now framed in a medical context. ... Whether wrinkles, breasts, or buttocks, impotence or social anxieties, or inattention in school, they all have become grist for the medical mill.\"\" We think it's a stretch to summarize Daschle's position as saying that seniors should be more accepting\u00a0of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them. Not treating wrinkles is one thing. Not treating, say, heart disease, is another. But that's fair enough for McCaughey to opine. This is labeled an opinion piece. The point is that these are McCaughey's words, not Daschle's. The last sentence, \"\"That means the elderly will bear the brunt,\"\" was her conclusion, McCaughey said. McCaughey said she is a meticulous scholar and \"\"I regret any misrepresentations made by others of my work or Mr. Daschle's views.\"\" Our efforts to reach Daschle for comment were not successful. In the chain e-mail, quote marks are shifted, clouding the issue of who is actually speaking, and the e-mail suggests that Daschle actually said that. The e-mail begins: \"\"Apparently,\u00a0seniors are expendable \u2014 treating us is not worth the expense (unless you're\u00a0a congressman!). Then later: Tom Daschle was credited today by Bloomberg with the following\u00a0statement. Bloomberg: \"\"Daschle says health-care reform will\u00a0not be pain free. Seniors should be more accepting of the\u00a0conditions that come with age  instead of treating them.\"\" The e-mail ends, urging, \"\"Please use the power of the Internet to get this message out. Talk it up at the grassroots level. We\u00a0have an election coming up in one year and nine months. We\u00a0have the ability to address and reverse the dangerous direction\u00a0the Obama administration and its allies have begun and in the\u00a0interim, we can make their lives miserable. Let\u2019s do\u00a0it!\"\" A few shifted quote marks make all the difference here. Instead of McCaughey's words, they become Daschle's. That kind of thing may have made for '70s sitcom gold, but here it just muddies the debate. We rule the claim in this e-mail .\"",

                              "text": "\"Anonymous e-mails claim that Sen. Barack Obama wants to \"\"unilaterally disarm our nation\"\" \u2014 and they say they have the video to prove it. \"\"You do not have to check Snopes to determine if this is true or  ... watch and listen to Obama's own words,\"\" warns one e-mail. \"\"Look at this ASAP \u2014 it may be pulled from the Obama Web site very soon,\"\" another e-mail states. \"\"This is shocking and reprehensible,\"\" opines a third e-mail. All the e-mails link to YouTube video that shows Barack Obama talking about his defense policies. The only problem is, Obama doesn't say in the video that he wants to disarm the United States. Rather, Obama talks about ending the war in Iraq, curtailing wasteful defense spending, and negotiating with Russia to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. He says he wants \"\"a world without nuclear weapons,\"\" but as we'll explain shortly, that statement is well within the mainstream of U.S. foreign policy thought. We went looking for the source of the video and found it fairly quickly on the Obama campaign Web site. The official version includes opening and concluding remarks in which he emphasizes he will eliminate wasteful spending and make his sole priority protecting the American people. Obama's campaign created the video while campaigning to win the Iowa caucuses. Obama was seeking the endorsement of Caucus4Priorities, an Iowa-based advocacy movement that wants a portion of defense spending diverted to domestic issues like education and jobs. The group instead endorsed John Edwards. Here's Obama's statement in its entirety. We've noted where the edited version in the chain e-mails begins and ends: \"\"Thanks so much for the Caucus4Priorities, for the great work you've been doing. As president, I will end misguided defense policies and stand with Caucus4Priorities in fighting special interests in Washington. First, I'll stop spending $9-billion a month in Iraq. [Edited video starts.] I'm the only major candidate who opposed this war from the beginning, and as president, I will end it. \"\"Second, I will cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending. I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems. I will not weaponize space. I will slow our development of future combat systems, and I will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial defense review is not used to justify unnecessary spending. \"\"Third, I will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons. To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons. I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material, and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals. [Edited video ends.] \"\"You know where I stand. I've fought for open, ethical and accountable government my entire public life. I don't switch positions or make promises that can't be kept. I don't posture on defense policy, and I don't take money from federal lobbyists for powerful defense contractors. As president, my sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the American people. Thanks so much.\"\" We suspect that the phrase \"\"a world without nuclear weapons\"\" may have set off Obama's anonymous critics. Actually, that goal has been promoted by foreign policy experts on both sides of the political aisle. Obama's goal echoes an opinion piece published in the  Wall Street Journal  on Jan. 4, 2007, authored by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn. Its title: \"\"A World Free of Nuclear Weapons.\"\" \"\"The end of the Cold War made the doctrine of mutual Soviet-American deterrence obsolete,\"\" their essay said. \"\"Deterrence continues to be a relevant consideration for many states with regard to threats from other states. But reliance on nuclear weapons for this purpose is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective.\"\" The piece then goes on to argue for similar points as Obama mentions in his statement, though in more detail. The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. The piece kicked off enough discussion and debate in the foreign policy community that the quartet authored another piece for the  Wall Street Journal  a year later, titled \"\"Toward a Nuclear-Free World,\"\" in which they discussed growing support for their ideas. Not everyone agreed, of course. In May 2008, the  Weekly Standard  published a detailed critique of the policies by Gary J. Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute and Henry Sokolski of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, who argued that their proposed solutions would be difficult to implement. For our fact-checking purposes, the point here is that Obama's statement falls firmly within the mainstream of the U.S. foreign policy debate. His position does not constitute unilateral disarmament, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. \"\"He's advocating the abolition of nuclear weapons in general, not nuclear disarmament,\"\" Pike said. \"\"If you're going to disagree with him, you have to understand what you're disagreeing with.\"\" The notion of unilateral disarmament is pretty much a nonstarter for both major political parties, including Obama, he added. \"\"Outside of the religious pacifist community, that is just not a policy position that has had meaningful political support in the United States,\"\" Pike said. One of the outlets that has promoted the Obama-wants-to-disarm-us argument is the conservative blog Macsmind. Macsmind linked on Feb. 27, 2008, to a YouTube video; several of the e-mails we received linked to the Macsmind post. Macsmind posted the commentary, \"\"Sen. McCain, you should grab this video and play it on every ad you can. This is absolutely shocking reprehensible. He plans to universally disarm our nation (sic). The question is for what, and more specifically 'for whom'.\"\" On June 8, Macsmind posted a full version of the video, noting \"\"some lefties are complaining that the video is a hack job and it's out of context. Therefore I present to you context.\"\" Macsmind and others may not like the foreign policy goals that Obama outlines in his video, but it's deceptive to call those goals unilateral disarmament. For this reason, we find this the chain e-mail's statements to be .\"",

In addition, the e-mail contained multiple links to the Wikipedia entry for Social Security and line graphs of Ronald Reagan's year-by-year approval ratings.\n\nBecause Obama copied and pasted some critical passages directly from right-wing editorials and personal blogs, the e-mail included formatting irregularities that caused many citizens to receive a message in which all of the apostrophes were replaced with question marks. Moreover, some software flagged it as spam.\n\n\"I don?t mean to be rude, but I thought we were all on the samepage about helath care reform,\" the 29th paragraph of Obama's e-mail read in part. \"It was part of my platform. You all knew I was goingt o pursue it when you elected me. And just real fast, going back on what I said earlier, the economic stimulus cut taxes for 95% of Americans. It didn't raise them. It cut them. You people need to look at facts and stop litnening to all the right wing crap out there. By the way, we're basically out of Iraq now. You?re welcome.\"\n\n\"JESUS CHRIST, WE LOST OVER @ MILLION JOBS BEFOREE I EVEN TOOK OFFICE!!!11!\" reads a sentence occupying a large white space between two massive chunks of texts, one of which was a 6,500-word tangent on the Muslim community center being built two blocks from the former World Trade Center site.\n\nAccording to White House sources, Obama \"snapped\" late Tuesday afternoon when a staffer reminded him he was scheduled to take a call from incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner. At that point, a visibly disgusted Obama was observed slowly repeating the words \"House Speaker Boehner\" before ordering everyone to leave the Oval Office, where he sat typing and, according to some, banging angrily on his keyboard for the next five hours.\n\nWhen White House Chief of Staff Pete Rouse urged the president to sleep on the e-mail, Obama told him he had already sent it.\n\n\"In terms of fulfilling campaign promises I think I've actually done a pretty good job in terms of fulfilling campaign,\" Obama wrote in response to an anonymous comment made to a post by conservative blogger Michelle Malkin. \"I know I said I'd close Guantanamo and I sti5ill want to do that but it's harder than it looks. And yes I know I said it would be done by now along with energy reform too\u2014-trust me it is still a priority because \"TOGETHER WE CAN & MUST EMBRACE CLEAN ENERGY\"\"\n\n\"Yes we can!\" the e-mail concluded. \"Ugh, you know what? Forget it. Believe what you want. Yours, Barack.\"\n\nThus far the response from the American public has been subdued, though a sixth of the populace did not even receive the e-mail because the message generated 50 million mailer-daemon delivery failure notifications.",

After brushing off his staff, Biden added that both candidates are qualified, but then added,  Hillary s overwhelmingly qualified to be president. Biden s comments will be an uplift to Clinton, who suffered a public humiliation after the Vice President branded her as  new  to the issues of income inequality, a staple of the Sanders campaign.Surprisingly, Biden told Mic that he does not believe Clinton is held to a higher standard because she is a woman, even though social psychology shows people do, in fact, hold women in politics to a different   higher  standard than men.Although not an official endorsement, is Biden ready for Hillary?Here s the interview, via YouTube: Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",

The report indicates that a formal offer of the position has not been discussed yet between Biden and Clinton.Biden has years of experience with foreign policy, including time leading the Foreign Relations Committee when he was a U.S. Senator from Delaware, and he has been one of President Obama s closest advisors on the topic while serving as Vice President.Biden considered running for President this year, and some polls indicated he would have been a strong challenger to Clinton. After the death of his son Beau, he decided against the campaign and has endorsed Clinton. His speech in favor of Clinton at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia was one of the highlights of the event.He has been holding campaign events on her behalf and is among the all-star team of surrogates including the President, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Senator Bernie Sanders that are promoting Clinton s campaign.Biden has also dedicated himself to leading the so-called  moon shot  project to cure cancer, a position that President Obama announced for him during his final State of the Union address.Featured image via Flickr",

Democrats badly want to get back control of the Republican-controlled Senate in the Nov. 8 election, and are sending Obama, Michelle Obama and Joe Biden to states where close races could tip the balance. In Nevada, Obama reserved most of his firepower for mocking three-term Republican U.S. Representative Joe Heck, who had supported his party\u2019s presidential candidate until earlier this month when Donald Trump\u2019s campaign went into crisis mode by the release of a video in which he lewdly bragged about groping and kissing women. \u201cI understand Joe Heck now wishes he never said those things about Donald Trump, but they\u2019re on tape, they\u2019re on the record,\u201d Obama said, using Heck\u2019s earlier praise of Trump against him. It\u2019s not just the Senate. Obama wants to capitalize on his high approval rating to help elect more Democrats to the House of Representatives, and has also endorsed about 150 candidates in state legislative races. At an intimate fundraising dinner in La Jolla, California, on Sunday evening, where tickets started at $10,000, Obama urged about 60 guests to help elect Democratic congressional candidate Doug Applegate, a former Marine colonel who is challenging Republican incumbent Darrell Issa. \u201cAs far as I can tell, (Darrell) Issa\u2019s primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere,\u201d Obama said. Issa, the former head of the House Oversight Committee, led a series of headline-grabbing investigations into Obama\u2019s administration - but has featured a photo of Obama signing legislation on a campaign brochure. \u201cNow that is the definition of chutzpah!\u201d Obama said. Last week, Obama excoriated Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida - who has a narrow lead over Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy, a congressman - for failing to repudiate Trump. In the final two weeks leading up to Nov. 8, Clinton said she planned to work hard to support congressional and state races. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be emphasizing the importance of electing Democrats down the ballot,\u201d Clinton told reporters traveling with her on Saturday. In Las Vegas, Obama was introduced by the Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto, a two-term Nevada attorney general, who would be the first Latina elected to the U.S Senate if she wins. \u201cWe can\u2019t elect Hillary and then saddle her with a Congress that is do-nothing, won\u2019t even try to do something,\u201d Obama said. The Nevada Senate seat is the only Senate race this year that Republicans could flip to their control. The seat has long been held by Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, who is retiring. Cortez Masto currently has a slim 2.3 percentage point lead in an average of polls tracked by RealClearPolitics over Heck. Obama won Nevada in 2008 and 2012. Polls show Clinton with a 4.2 percentage point lead at 45.4 percent support to Trump\u2019s 41.3 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average. ",

Democrat Helen Tai bested Republican Wendi Thomas in the Bucks County race -- notching a 96-vote victory in a district that has previously favored Republicans, with Trump winning there by 3 percentage points in 2016 and Mitt Romney by 13 points in 2012.  It's the latest evidence of America's suburbs shifting in Democrats' favor since Trump took office.  Former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Tai in the race, and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee said Tai's campaign knocked on 40,000 doors in the district.  The wins in state legislative races are seen -- in part because the candidates are typically little-known -- as gauges of voters' enthusiasm in small slices of the country. Other races, including a state supreme court contest in Wisconsin, have also shown major movement in Democrats' favor in key states since Trump took office.  Read More",

We have just learned that the FBI has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Now that the FBI is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime could be made by November 8th. Of course the most likely scenario is that Hillary Clinton will not be indicted before election day and that Americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the Clinton campaign. But if the FBI does quickly take action, it is possible that Hillary Clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the Democrats to come up with a new candidate. In fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for Clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. For example, the following comes from a Chicago Tribune article entitled \u201c Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside \u201c\u2026 So what should the Democrats do now? If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. But what the author of that article does not understand is that Tim Kaine would not automatically take her place if Clinton steps down before the election. In a previous article , I included a quote from a U.S. News & World Report article that explained what would happen if Hillary Clinton was removed from the Democratic ticket for some reason prior to November 8th\u2026 If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year\u2019s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members \u2013 a number that changes over time and is guided by the group\u2019s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. So if this email scandal forced Hillary Clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee would gather to select a new nominee. Who would they choose? Let\u2019s take a look at the top five options\u2026 #1 Tim Kaine He would seem to be an obvious choice since he is Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. But to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most Americans outside of the state of Virginia have very little familiarity with him. And at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. In fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. So to me it seems unlikely that the DNC would select Kaine as the replacement nominee. #2 Joe Biden Vice-President Joe Biden has far more name recognition than Tim Kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run \u2026 Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. Biden was asked in an interview with CNN Saturday if news that the FBI was re-opening their criminal probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. But according to the vice president, the short answer is \u201cno.\u201d The only thing that kept him from running, Biden said, was the recent death of his son, Beau. Unfortunately for Biden, he suffers from many of the same things that Kaine does. Biden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesn\u2019t have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. Biden would probably represent the \u201csafest\u201d choice for the Democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. #3 Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to Hillary Clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against Bernie Sanders. First of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the Democrats. He has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. Secondly, the Democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. Thirdly, Democratic insiders fear that he would be \u201canother McGovern\u201d and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. So even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that Sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. #4 Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren would be very popular with the \u201cBernie Sanders\u201d wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace Hillary Clinton with another woman. So she is definitely a possibility. But she does lack name recognition, and just like Sanders there would be concern that the Republicans would frame her candidacy as \u201canother McGovern\u201d because of her far left policies. #5 Michelle Obama One recent survey found that 67 percent of all Democrats would rather have a third term for Obama than a first term for Hillary Clinton. And these days Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating is running anywhere from +9 to +11. So the thought of another Obama in the White House is not as far-fetched as you might think. Michelle Obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the American people. And she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. For instance, her recent speech in New Hampshire was lauded as \u201cthe most influential speech of the 2016 campaign\u201d in a recent MSN article entitled \u201c In this campaign, Michelle Obama became more than just another political voice \u201c\u2026 The speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented Obama\u2019s place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view Trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. Three months before leaving the White House, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. \u201cWhen you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry,\u201d said Anita McBride, former chief of staff to Laura Bush and executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University. \u201cWe know she didn\u2019t like politics. But she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. People listen to her.\u201d If I were the Democrats, Michelle Obama is the one that I would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against Donald Trump. Of course the Obamas are just as radical as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but the American people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. And I certainly hope that Michelle Obama does not become the nominee if Hillary Clinton has to step aside, because Donald Trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. In the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the FBI will move quickly enough to force Hillary Clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. And if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in America completely upside down. Submit your review",

            "body": "Three presidents -- one sitting and two former -- descend on Pennsylvania Saturday for a final-stretch midterm push that underscores the stakes of one of the nation's most closely watched Senate races.\n\nFor President Joe Biden, who will hold a rare joint appearance with former President Barack Obama in Philadelphia meant to boost the Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, Pennsylvania will amount to a political stress test in his home state, where he's traveled 20 times since taking office.\n\nFor former President Donald Trump, who rallies outside of Pittsburgh in the city of Latrobe, a win by his hand-selected candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz could prove his own enduring viability in a commonwealth he lost by a narrow margin in 2020.\n\nThe consequences extend well beyond next week's election. As Trump prepares to announce a third presidential bid, potentially in the coming weeks, Biden's aides are taking their own initial steps toward mounting a reelection campaign. For a several-hour stretch on Saturday afternoon, the dynamics of a potential 2020 rematch will be laid bare.\n\nThe moment marks a historic anomaly. Former presidents have typically only waded sparingly into daily politics, mostly avoiding direct criticism of the men occupying the office they once held. Not since Grover Cleveland in 1892 has a defeated one-term president returned to win the White House again.\n\nThe convergence of presidents in Pennsylvania, each warning of dire consequences should the opposing party prevail, reflects the altered norms Trump precipitated when he took office nearly six years ago, quickly issuing false accusations against Obama of spying and general malfeasance.\n\nBiden, who spent much of his first year in office trying to avoid saying Trump's name, is no longer so cautious. He called out \"Trump and all his Trumpies\" at a rally in California this week and identified Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as \"Trump incarnate\" during a fundraiser outside Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday. At his own rallies, Trump plays a video reel of slip-ups to cast his successor as a gaffe-prone senior citizen -- though he hasn't as frequently gone after Obama.\n\nObama, meanwhile, has issued his harshest criticism to the cast of candidates backed by Trump, many of whom deny the 2020 election results and have modeled themselves after the 45th president.\n\n\"It doesn't just work out just because somebody's been on TV. Turns out, being president or governor is about more than snappy lines and good lighting,\" Obama said in Arizona last week of the Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, a former local news anchor.\n\nObama becomes a main draw in battleground states\n\nPennsylvania's senate and gubernatorial contests are the sole marquee races of this year's midterm cycle Biden has stumped in repeatedly. In other high-profile races, candidates have maintained their distance from a president with underwater approval ratings.\n\nThat hasn't been true of Obama, who has been in high demand among Democrats in close races. In the final weeks of the campaign, Obama has held raucous rallies in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada -- all states Biden has avoided in the last several months as candidates work to stave off Republican momentum.\n\nThat's a 180-degree turn from midterm cycles during Obama's presidency, when it was Biden venturing to more states -- including conservative-leaning districts -- where the sitting president was considered a drag on Democratic candidates.\n\nBiden is hardly irritated or even surprised that Obama is more of a draw on the campaign trail this year than him, according to officials. He has discussed some of the races with his former boss and believes Obama's message is both resonating with voters and complementary to his own.\n\nStill, their joint appearance Saturday will only serve to underscore their divergent styles and political abilities -- a comparison even some Democrats say ultimately favors Obama.\n\nBiden goes to Democrat-heavy areas\n\n\"I know you always ask me how we're doing. We're going to win this time around I think. I feel really good about our chances,\" Biden told reporters Friday in California.\n\nThe president has been bullish on Democrats' chances next week, even as many Democrats grow increasingly anxious about their party's prospects. His campaign schedule -- in blue states stumping for candidates in closer-than-expected races -- is itself a signal of Democrats'' vulnerabilities.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Biden has been traveling mostly to blue states he won, but where Democrats are nonetheless running closer-than-expected races. He stopped in New Mexico, California and Illinois before stumping in Pennsylvania on Saturday, and will campaign with the embattled New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday. He'll spend Election Eve in Maryland.\n\nPeople familiar with Biden's thinking say he accepts that not every Democratic candidate will welcome him as a surrogate while his approval ratings remain underwater. And he has told fellow Democrats he respects their political intuition when it comes to their own races.\n\nBut he has grown frustrated at coverage suggesting he is political albatross, according to people familiar with the conversations, arguing his policies -- when properly explained -- are widely popular with voters.\n\nCompared to both Obama and Trump, Biden has held far fewer campaign rallies for his party during this midterm cycle. Most of his engagements over the past month have been official events, delivered to crowds that sometimes only number a few dozen.\n\nHis rallies have begun drawing larger crowds in the waning days of the campaign. Six hundred people had to be turned away from an event in Southern California on Friday, according to the White House. And Biden addressed an overflow crowd in New Mexico that couldn't fit inside the main venue when he was holding a rally with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.\n\n\"I know you don't think it, but I think we have pretty good crowds. They're fairly enthusiastic. You don't write it that way, but they are,\" Biden said as he was departing California on Friday.\n\n'Get ready, that's all I'm saying'\n\nStill, his events haven't generated the same electricity as Obama's. The former president has laid into Trump and his acolytes who are running for office during his string of rallies across the country over the past weeks, using stinging humor and an air of bemusement to ridicule Republicans.\n\nLike Biden, he's also argued the American system of government is at stake in next week's election, telling a crowd in Arizona that \"democracy as we know it\" could perish if election deniers take office.\n\nObama and Biden last appeared together at the White House in September, when Obama's official portrait was unveiled in the White House East Room. The event had been put off while Trump was in office, partly because neither the Obamas nor the Trumps were interested in putting on a show of friendship.\n\nAs he campaigns for his endorsed candidates this fall, Trump has made little attempt to conceal his larger intentions: to buttress his own likely presidential campaign he hopes will return him to the White House.\n\n\"Get ready, that's all I'm saying,\" Trump told a crowd in Sioux City, Iowa, on Thursday, adding that he \"will very, very probably do it again.\"\n\nTop Trump aides have discussed the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his 2024 presidential campaign if Republicans fare well in the midterm elections, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nFor Biden, the decision may take a little longer. He has pointed to family discussions around the holidays when asked about his own timeline. Members of his political team have made early preparations for a campaign infrastructure, operating under the assumption he will decide to run again.\n\nHis motivating factor, aides say: Whether Trump jumps in himself.\n\n\u00a9 2022 Cable News Network.

According to Biden, he has a very high IQ.  In the above video, taken at April 3, 1987 campaign stop in Claremont, New Hampshire, Biden can be seen sparring with a voter who questioned his academic credentials. Biden responded, \u201cI think I have a much higher I.Q. than you do I suspect. I went to law school on a full academic scholarship \u2013 the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship.\u201d Biden went on to claim that he graduated in the top half of his law school. In his statement today, Mr. Biden, who attended the Syracuse College of Law and graduated 76th in a class of 85, acknowledged: \u201cI did not graduate in the top half of my class at law school and my recollection of this was inaccurate.\u201d \u2026 Newsweek said Mr. Biden had gone to Syracuse \u201con half scholarship based on financial need.\u201d  That seems like a pretty dumb thing to say. But Joe Biden says a lot of dumb things.  \"A man I'm proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next President of the United States \u2014 Barack America!\" --Joe Biden, at his first campaign rally with Barack Obama after being announced as his running mate, Springfield, Ill., Aug. 23, 2008  Also Joe Biden got in trouble for plagiarism. He's fairly unique in having a campaign collapse over a plagiarism scandal..  Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., trying to control mounting damage to his drive for the Democratic presidential nomination, admitted Thursday that he had committed plagiarism during his first year of law school but called the controversy surrounding his borrowed passages in recent speeches \"much ado about nothing.\" In his most detailed response to the controversy, which began during the weekend, Biden told a news conference that he \"did something very stupid 23 years ago,\" by lifting five pages from a law review article for a brief he wrote in a legal methods class at the University of Syracuse. Larry Sabato, professor of government at the University of Virginia, said: \"In my mind, this completely eliminates him from consideration\" for the nomination. \"A plagiarist can clearly not be in the White House.\" Biden's troubles began Saturday, when the New York Times and Des Moines Register noted the similarities between a rousing speech made by Neil Kinnock, the British Labor Party leader, and one delivered by Biden at a presidential debate at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 23. Biden's problems deepened when other newspapers noted similarities between a Biden speech to the California Democratic Party in February and rhetoric by the late Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy, at Fordham University in June, 1967, said: \"Few will have the greatness to bend history itself. But each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation.\"  That's pretty dumb. And Biden's response to 9/11? Really dumb.  I\u2019m groping here,\u201d Joe says. For once he isn\u2019t referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs, massaging, squeezing, caressing. Instead he\u2019s talking about foreign policy. The Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has no clue. Joe is worried that the Muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us. And he has a plan to make them feel better. \u201cSeems to me this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for $200 million to Iran,\u201d Senator Joe Biden says.

Biden is seen by many as a Democrat who excels at speaking to working class families across the racial spectrum, but still has a history of legislative experience as success as a Senator from Delaware and then as a two-term Vice President.Biden would likely be able to tap into existing Democratic donors if he ran, as he has near 100% name recognition domestically and internationally. Besides First Lady Michelle Obama, he would probably be the public figure to benefit most from an association with President Obama.Biden considered running in the 2016 election, but decided against it after the tragic death of his son Beau Biden.

In this case, he will only endorse one of the dumbest men in Washington DC for our next President if he agrees to his radical terms.How very  Putin-esque The talk in Democratic Party circles is that Barack Obama has told Joe Biden that he is prepared to endorse him for president if, in return, Biden promises to let Obama have a final say in the choice of his vice presidential running mate.According to these Democratic sources, Biden is mulling over the president s conditional offer of support.In addition, there is speculation among top Democratic sources that Obama has another quid pro quo for his endorsement: he wants Biden to choose an African American as his vice presidential running mate.In this scenario, which Obama has not yet fully explained to Biden, Biden would promise to serve only one term in the White House, after which he would back his vice president to succeed him.As Biden s vice president, Obama is said to favor former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a close Obama ally who is the first and only African American to have served as governor of the Bay State.Obama has already given Biden carte blanche to use Air Force Two, the official vice presidential plane, to crisscross the country and launch an unofficial campaign.So far, Biden has visited several key primary and general election states and hammered GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, charging that Trump is offering a  sick message  on immigration.Biden has also courted the Jewish vote, hinting that he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.With Obama s blessing, Biden appeared on  The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,  where he discussed his son Beau s death from brain cancer and came across as an authentic alternative to the stiff and overly scripted Hillary Clinton.

Biden was furious and he put the heckler in his place effortlessly.Bill Ackman, manager of a failing hedge fund, was speaking at the wall street event as well. Fox Business reports that during the private VIP dinner, former Florida governor and 2016 GOP presidential contender Jeb Bush, asked Biden why didn t you run? Biden explained that part of the decision stemmed from the death of his son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015. The room grew quiet as Biden became emotional, and said:  I m sorry I ve said enough. That s when Ackman blurted out  Why? That s never stopped you before. The formal, and understated dinner conversation suddenly turned tense, according to three people who were present and confirmed both the substance and the wording of Biden s responses.Biden, these people say, turned to someone seated near him, and asked,  who is this asshole?,  a reference to Ackman.Then he turned directly to Ackman and stated:  look, I don t know who you are, wiseass, but never disrespect the memory of my dead son!  these people say.Ackman attempted what was described as an apology, to which Biden said,  just shut the hell up. A spokesman for Ackman insisted that the idea that there was an argument or altercation between Joe Biden and Bill Ackman  is just utter nonsense. He even added that  Bill had a great time at the dinner and enjoyed spending time with the former vice president. But three different sources who witnessed the exchange say otherwise. Biden was in rare form,  said one person with direct knowledge of the heated conversation.  I can t believe it has never leaked out. There are some lines you just don t cross and this is one of them. Why Ackman thought he could get away with making this kind of remark is anybody s guess. But Biden was NOT having it and in the process, he proved that he has plenty of spunk left for a 2020 presidential run. I never thought she was a great candidate. I thought I was a great candidate, Biden said at the dinner, which raises speculation that he may decide to run for president in the next election. While Biden, who is 74, would be the oldest candidate to ever run for the White House, he certainly seems up to the task.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",

For many, their first exposure to him was when they watched him decimate Sarah Palin in the pre-election debates with a brilliant mind, clever wit and award-winning smile. Four years later, it was Paul Ryan who looked like a deer caught in the headlights as VP Biden considered his preposterous answers in their debates together and couldn t help but bust out in that ever-popular Joe Biden laugh.Joe Biden is one of the good ones. He s one of us. He s not a wealthy man or a sleezy politician who manages to live large off of campaign war chests; he s just a man   who happens to be second in line for the most powerful office in the world.Last year we were thrust into the personal life of Joe Biden and his family when his beloved son Beau, who the vice president calls his  soul,  was taken from him after a battle with cancer. What many people don t know is the incredible support Mr. Biden received from the only man he can call  boss,  President Barack Obama. The president delivered a beautiful and unforgettable eulogy for Beau, but according to an interview Biden did Monday with CNN, that was just the tip of the iceberg of the love and friendship he showed the Vice President.According to Biden, after Beau had the stroke that began the path towards his passing, President Obama came RUNNING down the hallway of the hospital to see if his friend and colleague was OK. Biden assured the president that he would be; that he and his wife would sell their house to get by and take care of Beau if need be.In an incredible act of selflessness and kindness, our President offered to give Joe Biden and his family whatever financial support they needed to weather the storm. As he tells the story you can see the tears welling up in his eyes. He says repeatedly that he s certain the president will be upset that he made such a personal notion public, but this man obviously wants the country to know exactly what kind of man sits in the Oval Office.He goes on to talk about the president and his family and how they are HIS family. How the President s daughters have sleepovers with his granddaughters and how much the special friendship between them has meant.Warning: The interview is a tear-jerker. Never have I been more proud of our president MY president or more thankful for having had the opportunity to witness his historic and monumentally successful administration than I am after watching this video:Featured image via screen capture",

Sadly,  Creepy Joe  earned his nickname after he was caught numerous times groping women and young girls on camera. Of course, the media gives Joe Biden a pass, because he s a Democrat, and if there s anything we ve learned over the past 4 decades, it s that high-profile members of the Democrat Party, like accused rapist Bill Clinton, can t be held accountable for their  playful  sexual advances towards women, and in the especially creepy Joe Biden s case, young girls.The first girl is a niece of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky (R). The girl with the sharp elbow is apparently a relative of freshman Senator Steve Daines of Montana (R).An enlarged image from C-SPAN shows Biden s hand sliding over the chest of McConnell s niece.Another incident shows Biden s right hand sliding down a girl s shoulder and then his fingers creep over toward her breast [at about the 4:20 mark].

But Creepy Joe persists Here s a compilation of Joe Biden s sexual assaults in plain view of the camera and family members:One of the best videos in the collection of Creepy Joe moments caught on tape was when the camera caught the former Senator Jeff Sessions actually SLAPPING Joe s hands when he attempts to grab ahold of Sessions granddaughter. Watch:In another incident from that day, Biden is meeting Colorado Senator Cory Gardner and his wife and 11-year-old daughter. The daughter puts herself on the other side of Biden from her father. Biden reaches out to shake her hand and tires to pull her toward him such that the resisting girl stumbles in her heels. Biden then asks her to hold the Bible for the swearing-in of her father to get her next to him so he could fondle her. Biden drags her over by the arm and positions her close to him with both hands on her. Biden hugs her with his right arm after the ceremonial swearing-in, pulling her hip to his crotch. Biden then holds the girl near him for the family photo session and keeps his left arm around her waist during the photos. Biden finishes by leaning over and whispering in her ear.Note: Watch Biden s hand beginning at the 1:32 mark.
