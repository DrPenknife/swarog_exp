                              "text": "The first installment of a documentary called \u201cPlandemic\u201d stormed through social media this week, promising viewers on its website that the film will \u201cexpose the scientific and political elite who run the scam that is our global health system.\u201d The video appeared across platforms, with individual uploads each garnering hundreds of thousands of views. But the viral video, running nearly 26 minutes, weaves a grand conspiracy theory by using a host of false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus pandemic and its origins, vaccines, treatments for COVID-19, and more. The video is largely an interview with Judy Mikovits, a former chronic fatigue researcher who has lobbed a number of accusations against National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. Mikovits was an author on a controversial 2009 study linking a retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome that was published in the journal Science, and then retracted in late 2011 after labs were unable to replicate the results and other issues were brought to light. That same year, in September 2011, Mikovits was fired from her position as research director at the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada and arrested two months later after the institute alleged she stole a laptop, flash drives and other property with institute information. While Mikovits claims in the documentary that she was held in jail despite being charged with \u201cnothing,\u201d a criminal complaint from November 2011 shows she was charged with two felonies related to the stolen property. The charges were later dropped. What followed was a years-long legal battle in which Whittemore won a civil judgment against Mikovits; Mikovits filed for bankruptcy; and Mikovits alleged that Whittemore defrauded the government by misusing federally funded research materials. The latter case was dismissed this year. Mikovits recently co-authored a book with self-described \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d Kent Heckenlively, with a forward by vaccine skeptic Robert Kennedy Jr., and has spoken at events aimed at discrediting vaccines. In the video, she claims, \u201cAnd they will kill millions as they already have with their vaccines.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what vaccines she\u2019s referring to, but vaccines have been credited with saving millions of lives. For instance, according to one estimate by researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the measles vaccine has saved more than 20 million lives across the globe from 2000 to 2016 alone. In the sections below, we break down eight of the false, misleading and unfounded claims aired in \u201cPlandemic.\u201d Unfounded Attacks on Fauci The first part of the video focuses largely on two sweeping, but unrelated, accusations against Fauci, who also has been a fixture at the White House briefings on COVID-19. Without offering any evidence, the video claims that Fauci was part of a \u201ccover-up\u201d and that he worked with other doctors to \u201ctake credit and make money\u201d on the AIDS epidemic. Filmmaker Mikki Willis sets the tone for this section of the video, saying to Mikovits, \u201cSo Anthony Fauci, the man who is heading the pandemic task force, was involved in a cover-up.\u201d Willis, a former model, has a large following on YouTube, where he has previously claimed the novel coronavirus was \u201cintentionally released.\u201d \u201cHe directed the cover-up,\u201d Mikovits says. \u201cAnd, in fact, everybody else was paid off, and paid off big time.\u201d But at no point in the video does anyone explain what Fauci supposedly covered up. We asked Mikovits in a phone interview to explain. She said it was a reference to her 2009 research paper that was later retracted. Mikovits holds Fauci responsible and claims it was part of a \u201ccover-up\u201d on the part of the medical establishment to keep hidden her research linking a mouse retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome. In the years since the research was first published, Mikovits has expanded its reach, suggesting that it could apply also to prostate cancer, lymphoma, and autism. The NIAID funded Mikovits\u2019 initial research related to chronic fatigue syndrome, and, after she was fired, another researcher at Whittemore was awarded the remaining grant money. But there is no evidence that Fauci, personally, had anything to do with it. And the journal that published the paper made no mention of Fauci in its retraction. Rather, it explained it was \u201cfully retracting\u201d the paper because the results couldn\u2019t be replicated, even in the same lab, and \u201cthere is evidence of poor quality control in a number of specific experiments in the Report.\u201d As for the claim about the AIDS epidemic, that goes back much further. In the early 1980s, Mikovits was working as a technician at the National Cancer Institute. She claims that the lab she was in had identified the HIV virus from blood and saliva samples and prepared a paper detailing those findings that was slated for publication. But, she says in the video, referencing one of the pioneers of AIDS research, Dr. Robert Gallo, \u201cFauci holds up the paper for several months, while Robert Gallo writes his own paper and takes all the credit.\u201d Mikovits could not provide the name of her lab\u2019s paper or the journal that was going to publish it when we spoke to her, so we couldn\u2019t check on that. But here\u2019s what we do know about the timeline for AIDS research in the early 1980s: 1981 \u2013 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an article in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report describing a rare lung infection in five young gay men in Los Angeles. Fauci would later recall seeing that article, saying in a 2011 interview, \u201cI remember putting the issue to the side of my desk, thinking, \u2018Wow, what a bizarre curiosity.\u2019 One month later, in July, a second MMWR report came to my desk, and this time, an additional 26 men had it, again all gay, all seemingly healthy, and not only in LA, but now also in San Francisco and New York City. I remember reading it very clearly. It was the first time in my medical career I actually got goose pimples. I knew something was very wrong. It changed the direction of my career.\u201d 1982 \u2013 The CDC used the term AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, for the first time. 1983 \u2013 A group of French researchers identified the virus now known as HIV. Twenty-five years later, Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier were awarded the Nobel Prize for that discovery. 1984 \u2013 A team led by Gallo at the National Cancer Institute published research showing that HIV causes AIDS. Beyond the unsupported claim that Fauci \u2014 who didn\u2019t become the director of NIAID until 1984 \u2014 stymied early AIDS research at the National Cancer Institute, Mikovits also claims that he has profited from the epidemic. Referring vaguely to patents, Mikovits says in the video that Fauci was working with other researchers \u201cto take credit and make money\u201d on the AIDS epidemic. It\u2019s true that Fauci\u2019s name appears on at least six patents related to AIDS research. But it\u2019s less clear how much he has profited from them. In 2005, the Health and Human Services Department was criticized for not disclosing how much government scientists were collecting from patent royalties. At the time, Fauci expressed concern over the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest and said that he donated all of his royalty money to charity. Scientists: Novel Coronavirus Not \u2018Manipulated\u2019 Mikovits makes a claim that numerous scientists have refuted: that the novel coronavirus \u201cwas manipulated\u201d in a laboratory and is not \u201cnaturally occurring.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s very clear this virus was manipulated, these, this family of viruses was manipulated and studied in a laboratory where the animals were taken into the laboratory,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cAnd this is what was released, whether deliberate or not, that cannot be naturally occurring. Somebody didn\u2019t go to a market, get a bat. The virus didn\u2019t jump directly to humans. That\u2019s not how it works. That\u2019s accelerated viral evolution. If it was a natural occurrence, it would take it up to 800 years to occur. This occurred from SARS-1 within a decade. That is not naturally occurring.\u201d The exact origin of the coronavirus is not known, but scientists have said the genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 indicate it was neither created in a lab nor manipulated. \u201cOur analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,\u201d said an article published in Nature Medicine in March. Instead, the authors said it\u2019s plausible that the coronavirus originated in one of two ways: \u201cnatural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,\u201d which refers to the spread of disease from animals to humans, or \u201cnatural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\u201d The authors said the possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out, but they \u201cdo not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible\u201d because they had observed \u201call notable SARS-CoV-2 features \u2026 in related coronaviruses in nature.\u201d In a statement in April, University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes, who was involved in mapping the genome of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, likewise said: \u201cCoronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 are commonly found in wildlife species and frequently jump to new hosts. This is also the most likely explanation for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d Holmes said there is \u201cunfounded speculation\u201d that a bat coronavirus named RaTG13, which was being kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was the origin of the new coronavirus. But, he explained, that is not the case, for several reasons. \u201cIn summary, the abundance, diversity and evolution of coronaviruses in wildlife strongly suggests that this virus is of natural origin,\u201d Holmes said. He added that more sampling of other animals \u201cis needed to resolve the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d Mikovits also may give viewers a false impression when she says the novel coronavirus \u201coccurred from SARS-1,\u201d which is a different coronavirus that caused a global outbreak in 2003. SARS-CoV, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is similar but distinct from SARS-CoV-2. The viruses share about 79% of the same genetic make-up, but SARS-CoV-2 is even more closely related (96%) to the bat coronavirus from which Holmes has said SARS-CoV-2 wasn\u2019t derived. We\u2019ve already written about a bogus analysis that suggested the new coronavirus could have leaked from a Chinese lab because a portion of its genome is similar to part of a viral vector that was used in previous research on SARS. Kristian Andersen, the director of infectious disease genomics at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told us in an email that analysis was \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d Misleading Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding Also on the issue of the Wuhan lab, the video shows a clip claiming that \u201c$3.7 million flowed from the National Institutes of Health here in the U.S. to the Wuhan lab in China\u201d and that NIAID \u201chad already been conducting experiments with the Wuhan lab in the past in regard to coronavirus.\u201d That\u2019s misleading. The project referenced, as other fact-checkers have previously reported, is actually funding from NIAID to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit that researches emerging infectious diseases. The project was done to \u201cexamine the risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China,\u201d in particular the risk posed by bats, according to a 2014 description. NIH records show the project was awarded nearly $3.4 million altogether. Most of the funding was through a five-year grant awarded in 2014, Robert Kessler, an EcoHealth spokesman, said in an email to us. The group was renewed for a second five-year grant in 2019 and received $292,161 \u2014 but NIH recently terminated the grant. Of that money, only $600,000 (from the first grant) was given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Kessler said. The Wuhan lab was a collaborator that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department, he added, and one that researchers used to conduct genetic analyses of the viruses. \u201cIn each of nearly 30 countries around the world where we work, we collaborate with local institutions, all of which are pre-approved by our federal funders,\u201d EcoHealth said in an April 28 statement about the terminated funding. \u201cIt\u2019s been EcoHealth Alliance\u2019s position for the past 15 years that coronaviruses present a clear and immediate threat to our safety. That seems clearer now than ever before.\u201d The group said its research \u201caimed to analyze the risk of coronavirus emergence and help in designing vaccines and drugs to protect us from COVID-19 and other coronavirus threats. In fact, genetic sequences of two bat coronaviruses that we discovered with this grant have been used as lab tools to test the breakthrough antiviral drug Remdesivir.\u201d So it\u2019s incorrect, and also lacks context, to claim NIAID gave \u201c$3.7 million\u201d to the Wuhan lab. Flu Vaccines Don\u2019t Contain Coronaviruses Mikovits falsely claims that \u201cif you\u2019ve ever had a flu vaccine, you were injected with coronaviruses.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s wrong,\u201d Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cThis person doesn\u2019t know what she is talking about,\u201d Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email, adding, \u201cI think this person is just seeking publicity.\u201d In an interview, we asked Mikovits what support she had for the claim, and she didn\u2019t provide any. She only said that flu vaccines are cultured in chicken eggs and dog kidney cells, and those animals have coronaviruses. It\u2019s an extreme leap to then claim animal strains of coronaviruses end up in vaccines tested and approved for people. Mikovits further said she attributes the spread of the novel coronavirus worldwide \u201cat least in part\u201d to the use of the flu vaccine. As we\u2019ve explained before, coronaviruses are a diverse family of viruses, and some, such as canine coronavirus, infect animals. Those aren\u2019t the same as SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. As for influenza vaccines, most are made using hen\u2019s eggs, Offit explained, and about 10% of vaccines in the U.S. are cell-culture vaccines, which use mammalian cells instead of eggs. Specifically, the process uses Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, or MDCK, cells. \u201cThese lines have been around for a long time,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThis is a well-tested \u2026 cell line that does not contain coronavirus\u201d and \u201cwould never be allowed to.\u201d On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more information on how egg-based and cell-based influenza vaccines are manufactured. A cell-based method that also used eggs at the beginning of the process received Food and Drug Administration approval in 2012, and a fully cell-based process got FDA approval in 2016. The CDC notes that once vaccines are manufactured, \u201cFDA tests and approves the vaccines prior to release and shipment.\u201d This cell-based technology has been used in other U.S. vaccines, \u201cincluding vaccines for rotavirus, polio, smallpox, hepatitis, rubella and chickenpox,\u201d the CDC says. No Evidence Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19 Mikovits also repeats the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cthe flu vaccines increase the odds by 36% of getting COVID-19,\u201d which we\u2019ve previously covered. Experts say that there has been no study linking the flu shot to elevated risk for the novel coronavirus. The military study cited by Mikovits involved four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2. More than that, the results in the study that indicate a flu-vaccinated person had an increased likelihood of testing positive for a seasonal coronavirus do not appear to be adjusted for age groups or seasons. Those factors could affect someone\u2019s chances of getting a specific virus, regardless of whether or not they\u2019ve been vaccinated for the flu. Multiple scientists have pointed out the same issue in other fact-checks, too, and have debunked the erroneous suggestion that the study looked at SARS-CoV-2. The Military Health System told us in a statement that \u201cthe study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19.\u201d MHS further said \u201cit remains essential for people to obtain the seasonal flu shot each year as it becomes available.\u201d Hydroxychloroquine: Unproven COVID-19 Therapy The video makes the unsubstantiated claim that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine is \u201cthe most effective medication to treat\u201d COVID-19, citing a survey of doctors. Shortly after that, Mikovits says hydroxychloroquine is \u201ceffective against these families of viruses,\u201d referring to the family of coronaviruses, such as COVID-19, but \u201cthey keep it from the people.\u201d We have covered this ground before when President Donald Trump encouraged the off-label use of chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Both drugs are used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. But there is only limited evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for COVID-19, and it carries potential health risks. The National Institutes of Health says there is \u201cinsufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.\u201d Despite insufficient clinical data, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization, or EUA, order on March 28 that allowed for the drugs to be used as a treatment for some hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A little less than a month later, the FDA issued a warning against using \u201chydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.\u201d The warning came a few days after a study found that patients at Veterans Health Administration medical centers treated with hydroxychloroquine had an increased mortality risk compared with those that were not treated with the drug. In the video, Mikovits says, \u201cThe AMA was saying doctors will lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug that\u2019s been on the list of essential medicine worldwide for 70 years. Dr. Fauci calls that \u2018anecdotal.\u2019 It\u2019s not storytelling if we have thousands of pages of data saying it\u2019s effective against these families of viruses. This is essential medicine and they keep it from the people.\u201d It\u2019s not true that the American Medical Association told doctors they \u201cwill lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine\u201d for COVID-19. The AMA issued a statement saying it opposed \u201cpurchasing excessive amounts\u201d of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for possible COVID-19 treatment. But it also said, \u201cNovel off-label use of FDA-approved medications is a matter for the physician\u2019s or other prescriber\u2019s professional judgment.\u201d As for hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness against coronaviruses, we have written that at least two studies show that it has antiviral activity against the novel coronavirus in cells grown in the lab. But there is only anecdotal evidence that the drug works in people. Trump cited in a tweet the results of a small clinical trial in France, but the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal in which the study appeared, later issued a statement that said \u201cthe article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\u201d We cover this more extensively in our story \u201cTrump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim.\u201d Wrong Message on Masks In attacking public health measures taken to address the pandemic in the U.S., Mikovits wrongly suggests that using masks could lead to people infecting themselves with their own breath. \u201cWearing the mask literally activates your own virus,\u201d Mikovits said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions and if it happens to be SARS-CoV-2, then you\u2019ve got a big problem.\u201d Experts were perplexed by what she meant and said the implication that simply breathing through a mask could lead to self-infection doesn\u2019t square with science. Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, told us: \u201cIf you\u2019re shedding (breathing out) virus, then you\u2019re already infected. Even without a mask, infected people who are shedding virus probably rebreathe some of their own viruses, but there are already billions times more viruses in your body. Hopefully, the mask is protecting other people from your exhalations.\u201d And Lisa Brosseau, an expert on respiratory protection and infectious diseases and a certified industrial hygienist, said in an email that \u201cviruses are not \u2018activated\u2019 by anything,\u201d as Mikovits suggests. Viruses instead \u201crequire living cells in order to replicate,\u201d but their viability or ability to replicate isn\u2019t affected whether someone is wearing a mask or not, said Brosseau, a former professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. If anything, viruses in the environment can be \u201crendered non-viable by exposure to certain temperature\u201d and relative humidity conditions. \u201cThere is nothing magical about our breath that \u2018activates\u2019 or \u2018reactivates\u2019 a virus,\u201d Brosseau said. As we\u2019ve previously written, while there is little research on cloth masks, the hope is that they can help prevent individuals, even those who do not feel sick, from unknowingly spreading COVID-19 to others. Brosseau said people should frequently wash cloth masks, though, and stressed that masks are not a substitute for social distancing. The CDC notes the same. False Suggestion About Ebola Mikovits says in the video: \u201cIn 1999, I was working in Fort Detrick \u2026 and my job was to teach Ebola how to infect human cells without killing them. Ebola couldn\u2019t infect human cells until we took it in the laboratories and taught them.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what she meant by that, and she didn\u2019t explain when we asked about her claim. But the suggestion that Ebola, which includes six species of ebolaviruses, didn\u2019t infect people until 1999, or later, is false. The first two species, Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus, were discovered after outbreaks in 1976 in Central Africa. Combined, those two viruses, which scientists believe may have come from bats or nonhuman primates (such as chimpanzees, apes, monkeys, etc.), killed about 430 people that year, according to the CDC. Zaire ebolavirus \u2014 which is also linked to the largest Ebola outbreak which began in West Africa in 2014 \u2014 is said to have initially spread in 1976 through the use of contaminated needles and syringes at a hospital in the village where the first infected person was treated. And the Sudan ebolavirus is believed to have started with workers in a cotton factory. In fact, the CDC says four of the six species of ebolavirus \u2014 Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (formerly C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ebolavirus) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus \u2014 are known to cause disease in people. And three of the four species were discovered prior to 1999. A fifth species, Reston ebolavirus, was first discovered in 1989 in research monkeys imported into the U.S. from the Philippines. That species \u201cis known to cause disease in nonhuman primates and pigs, but not in people,\u201d the CDC says. There have been cases in which individuals developed Reston ebolavirus antibodies, but did not experience symptoms. The sixth species, Bombali ebolavirus, was discovered in 2018 in a bat in Sierra Leone. It also is not known to infect humans. FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

We are joined by the director of CDC\u2019s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases who will give opening remarks. I will now turn the call over. Thank you for joining us. The global novel coronavirus situation is rapidly evolving and expanding. There are still a lot of news coverage about community spread in a few countries since the last time we talked. This means that cases of COVID-19 are appearing without a known source of exposure. Communities include Hong Kong, Italy, Iran, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Community spread is often a trigger to begin implementing new strategies tailored to local circumstances that blunt the impact of disease and can slow the spread of virus. The fact this virus has caused illness \u2013 including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of the pandemic. The world moves closer towards meeting the third criteria. Worldwide spread of the new virus. The U.S. has been implementing an aggressive containment strategy that requires detecting, tracking, and isolating all cases. As much as possible and preventing more introduction of disease notably at points of entry. We\u2019ve restricted travel into the United States while also issuing extensive travel advisories for countries currently experiencing community spread. Our travel notices are changing almost daily. We\u2019ve also enacted the first quarantine of this scale in the U.S. And are supporting the state department and HHS in repatriating citizens from high-risk areas. We are doing this with the goal of slowing the introduction of this new virus into the U.S. And buying us more time to prepare. To date, our containment strategies have been largely successful. As a result, we have very few cases in the United States and no spread in the community. But as more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder. Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country. It\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness. We will maintain for as long as practical a dual approach where we continue measures to contain this disease but also employ strategies to minimize the impact on our communities. At this time, there\u2019s no vaccine to protect against this new virus and no medications approved to treat it. Non-pharmaceutical interventions or NPIs will be the most important tools in our response to this virus. What these interventions look like at the community level will vary depending on local conditions. What is appropriate for one community seeing local transmission won\u2019t necessarily be appropriate for a community where no local transmission has occurred. This parallel, proactive approach of containment and mitigation will delay the emergence of community spread in the United States while simultaneously reducing its ultimate impact. To illustrate how this works, I\u2019d like to share with you some of the specific recommendations made in the document I mentioned last Friday including some of the steps we would take here if needed. This document is called Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza United States 2017. It draws from the findings of nearly 200 journal articles written between 1990 and 2016. This document looked at what can be done at the individual and community level during a pandemic when we don\u2019t have a vaccine or proven medical treatment for the disease. We\u2019re looking at data since 2016 and adjusting our recommendations to the specific circumstances of COVID-19. But this posted document provides a frame work for our response strategy. Based on what is known now, we would implement these NPI measures in a very aggressive, proactive way as he have been doing with our containment efforts. There are three categories of NPIs. Personal NPIs which include personal protective measures you can take every day and personal protective measures reserved for pandemics. Community NPIs which include social distancing measures designed to keep people who are sick away from others. And school closures and dismissals. And environmental NPIs which includes surface cleaning measures. NPIs routinely recommended for prevention of respiratory virus transmission include everyday personal protective measures. These are preventive measures we recommend during influenza season. These NPIs are recommended during a pandemic regardless of the severity level of the respiratory illness. Personal protective measures reserved for pandemics include voluntary home quarantine of household members who have been exposed to someone they live with who is sick. Now I\u2019d like to talk through some examples of what community NPIs look like. These are practical measures that can help limit exposure by reducing exposure in community settings. Students in smaller groups or in a severe pandemic, closing schools and using internet-based teleschooling to continue education. For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase teleworking options. On a larger scale, communities may need to modify, postpone, or cancel mass gatherings. Looking at how to increase telehealth services and delaying elective surgery. The implementation of environmental NPIs would require everyone to consistently clean frequently touched surfaces and objects at home, at school, at work, and at large gatherings. Local communities will need to look at which NPIs to implement and when based on how transmission and disease is and what can be done locally. This will require flexibility and adaptations as disease progresses and new information becomes available. Some of these measures are better than none. But the maximum benefit occurs when the elements are layered upon each other. Some community level interventions that may be most effective in reducing the spread of a new virus like school closures are also the most likely to be associated with unwanted consequences and further disruptions. Secondary consequences of some of these measures might include missed work and loss of income. I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now. I had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and I told my children that while I didn\u2019t think that they were at risk right now, we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives. You should ask your children\u2019s school about their plans for school dismissals or school closures. If ask if there are plans for teleschool. I contacted my local school superintendent this morning with exactly those questions. You should think about what you would do for childcare if schools or day cares close. If teleworking is an option for you. All of these questions can help you be better prepared for what might happen. CDC and other federal agencies have been practicing for this since the 2019 influenza pandemic. In the last two years, CDC has engaged in two pandemic influenza exercises that have required us to prepare for a severe pandemic and just this past year we had a whole of government exercise practicing similarly around a pandemic of influenza. Right now CDC is operationalizing all of its pandemic response plans working on multiple fronts including specific measures to prepare communities to respond to local transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. Before I take questions, I want to address the issue of the test kits CDC is developing. I am frustrated like I know many of you are that we have had issues with our test. I want to assure you that we are working to modify the kit and hope to send out a new version to state and local jurisdictions soon. There are currently 12 states or localities around the U.S. That can test samples as well as we are testing at CDC 400 samples were tested overnight. There is no current backlog or delay for testing at CDC. Commercial labs will also be coming online soon with their own tests. This will allow the greatest number of tests to happen closer to where potential cases are. Last, I want to recognize that people are concerned about this situation. I would say rightfully so. I\u2019m concerned about the situation. CDC is concerned about the situation. But we are putting our concerns to work preparing. And now is the time for businesses, hospitals, community schools, and everyday people to begin preparing as well. Over the last few weeks, CDC has been on dozens of calls with different partners in the health, retail, education, and business sectors. In the hopes that employers begin to respond in a flexible way to differing levels of severity, to refine their business response plans as needed. I also want to acknowledge the importance of uncertainty. During an outbreak with a new virus, there is a lot of uncertainty. Our guidance and advice are likely to be fluid subject to change as we learn more. We will continue to keep you updated. I\u2019d be happy to take a few questions now. Brittany, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin our question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question over the phone, press star, then one and record your name clearly when prompted. If you need to withdraw your question, press star then two. One moment as we wait for the first question. Our first question comes from Lisa from PBS. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thank you for doing this. I have some more questions about the test kits. Thank you for what you gave us the update on, but can you go into more detail about how they work? Can any hospital now just kind of use a swab to get a sample and then send that to the CDC? And then how long do you estimate it will take to have the kits replaced so that more localities can actually do the analysis and do you have enough money for this kind of field work and test analysis right now? Okay. I\u2019m going to start from maybe the part of a patient perspective which is, you know, right now our focus is still on individuals with a travel history that would put them at risk for COVID-19. Or people who are close contacts of someone who has COVID-19. Those individuals when they are identified by a health care provider, the health care provider calls the health department. The health department helps them triage those patients to make \u2014 and then the samples are worked with the health department. Now, as we move forward, though, if we are looking at the trajectory of expecting that there likely will be community spread of this virus in the united states, the case definition may change away from narrowly around people with travel. Again, that\u2019s what we would anticipate doing as there is community spread. If that happens, it will be more and more important that the clinicians have a full tool kit. That\u2019s why the availability of commercial kits would be so helpful. So in the short-term, it\u2019s the clinician calls the health department. And either the health department already has the test kit themselves or if they don\u2019t yet have it stood up, they send it to CDC. Our turnaround at CDC is within a day. There is a little bit of shipping time. But that\u2019s the process. In terms of timing, I think at this point what I would say is we are working as fast as we can. We understand the frustration of our partners in the health care sector, in health departments. You certainly can imagine we want to resolve this as quickly as possible. But we have to make sure that while resolving it, we keep to the highest level of quality assurance. Because as important as speed is, it is more important that we make sure that our results are correct. In terms of funding, there\u2019s already been funds available that are helping us with the activities that we have now that is the diagnostic testing at CDC. And we\u2019ll continue to proceed focused on our priorities which as I\u2019ve said are getting this test kit out to state health departments so they can be doing that themselves as an interim step to getting it commercially available would be a great advancement. Next question. Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig from KNX 1070 news radio Los Angeles. Your line is now open. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your time. Couple of questions. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about what\u2019s being done to prepare for possible people who would be quarantined. I\u2019d like to know what that is. And also is the Chinese government leveling with you? Are they telling you the truth? Have they given you the straight dope, so to speak, as to what you need to know about the coronavirus? So in answer to your first question, I would say generally we are working on a daily basis with state and local health departments across the country on exactly those issues. What are the local considerations for quarantine or isolation and how can they be resolved? And in each location in the united states, it may end up being a slightly different answer. Our focus is on the best health of the individual whom we are working with in terms of whether they need quarantine or isolation. In terms of the Chinese government, there has been a WHO team on the ground in China as well in Wuhan. There are data coming out from those efforts. We have a lot of information from china. Frankly, we have a lot of new information from all the other countries around the world now that are reporting community spread and we are as quickly as possible trying to synthesize that information. It is providing us more data in terms of making our own estimations in the U.S. Of what we\u2019re going to see. Communities that are having community spread are certainly very informative in terms of what we might expect in the united states. And I think that whole body of evidence is frankly coming really quickly at us. That\u2019s why we have a team of people here at CDC synthesizing it all. Next question, please. Thank you. And our next question comes from Megan from STAT. Your line is now open. Hi there. Thank you so much for taking my question. I\u2019m wondering if you could expand a little bit on whether you are reconsidering testing people with travel history to other countries now where they might be infected. And I\u2019m also wondering if you could say whether or not the agency has considered getting tests from another country that\u2019s supplying tests to other nations as well. So the answer to the first question is certainly, we\u2019re considering what the spread of illness in other countries looks like and how it impacts the potential risk the Americans traveling abroad in those countries. Those conversations are going on as we speak. We obviously are working closely with the partners on those considerations. And when there is new information in terms of case definitions, we\u2019ll definitely publicize that broadly. You know, as I said, we are still at the stage of containment, but we are already starting to plan for mitigation. And part of the mitigation planning is the participation of community spread in the united states. And as that happens, it would certainly dramatically impact how we\u2019re considering who is on the case. As you can imagine, the symptoms of novel coronavirus look a lot like other viral respiratory diseases that are circulating this time of year. So it\u2019s going to be difficult for clinicians to differentiate fully on the basis of those \u2014 solely on the basis of the symptoms. In terms of diagnostic tests, what I would say is we\u2019re working closely with FDA on this. And obviously with the state and local health department partners. And I think that we are rapidly moving towards getting those kits more available in the U.S. In the systems that we have. Really I think we\u2019re close. I just wouldn\u2019t want to give an estimate of when until we\u2019re there. But I think we\u2019re close. And remember, a dozen states now have the kit and are testing and there\u2019s tests available in the U.S. So I think we\u2019re making forward progress. Thank you. And our next question comes from Lena Sun from Washington Post. Your line is now open. Thank you. I had a couple questions. One is if a dozen states have the kit, then do they still need to send those tests to CDC for confirmation? Which are the states that have the tests? And more broadly, your comments today seem to represent a significant escalation in the sort of severity and urgency of the now. At a briefing this morning for Congress, I believe some members were told that we now face a very strong chance of an extremely serious outbreak. Is that the CDC\u2019s feeling right now that we face an extremely strong chance of a serious outbreak? Okay. So let\u2019s see. The first question, it\u2019s 12 state or local health departments. And so it\u2019s not 12 states total. We are still as a point of part of how we roll out these tests, those tests that are positive still do come to CDC for confirmation. I think that\u2019s just part of a normal process to ensure we are keeping to the utmost quality control. I don\u2019t have a list of state or local health departments in front of me, but I think we can provide that. In terms of a change in tone, I guess what I would say is as I look back on the scripts of the telebriefings that we\u2019ve given over the past month, we have for a long time been saying \u2014 we have for many weeks been saying that while we hope this is not going to be severe, we are planning as if it is. The data over the last week and the spread in other countries has certainly raised our level of concern and raised our level of expectation that we are going to have community spread here. So I think that that\u2019s perhaps the change of tone you\u2019ve seen. I think what we still don\u2019t know is what that will look like as many of you know. We can have community spread in the united states and have it be reasonably mild. We could have community spread in the united states and have it be very severe. And so that is what \u2014 that is what we don\u2019t completely know yet. And we certainly also don\u2019t exactly know when it\u2019s going to happen. I think it would be nice for everybody if we could say, you know, on this date is when it\u2019s going to start. We don\u2019t know that yet. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re asking folks in every sector as well as people within their families to start planning for this because as we\u2019ve seen from the recent countries that have had community spread when it is hit in those countries, it has moved quite rapidly. So we want to make sure that the American public is prepared. Thank you. And as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one. Limit to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from Eben from Fox news. Your line is now open. Thank you very much for doing the call today. There has been some political back and forth now that democrats are accusing the president which essentially means the administration and everything that falls under that as being ill prepared for coronavirus, requesting too little of amount in terms of their request for $2.5 billion. Do you feel that we are ill prepared from a financial standpoint? I know you are a clinician and I don\u2019t want you to get too much into politics, but do you have what you need to do your job? I guess I\u2019ll answer that two ways. The first is HHS can provide information or answer questions about the funds that are available. What I can say from my perspective is I\u2019ve been at CDC for 25 years and that if you asked public health officials over the course of that time what they feared as an expectation, it was something exactly like this. And so the idea that we might have a pandemic of influenza or a pandemic of a respiratory viral infection is something that we\u2019ve known about and have been planning and preparing for. That\u2019s why we at CDC have been exercising with the state and local health departments. That\u2019s why the whole of government exercise last year, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested so much on the foundation we are now responding. But that being said, we are never going to ever be able to be so completely prepared that we\u2019re prepared for any inevitability. We always are going to find that diseases surprise us and that there was some consideration that is slightly different from what we planned for. So have we made a lot of progress in the 25 years I\u2019ve been here? Yes. Are we better prepared today than we were 20 years ago? Yes. But are we completely prepared? You know, diseases surprise us and therefore we need to be reacting to the current situation even if it differs from what we planned for. You know, in general we are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad. I continue to hope that in the end we\u2019ll look back and feel like we are over-prepared, but that is a better place to be in than being under-prepared. And just like the preparedness for a pandemic influenza provides such a strong foundation for this response, any preparedness we do as a country, at schools, businesses, within our families will always be helpful for whatever the next event is. And so I don\u2019t think in general that preparedness will ever go to waste. Next question, please. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike from A.P. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you for taking my call. If I could ask a couple. One is just the latest case count, it\u2019s been a little confusing for some of us just to sort out exactly how many U.S. Cases there are and how they\u2019re being sorted out. Second, if you could speak to your best and latest understanding of the severity of the disease. Of course there\u2019s some news today about the WHO mission coming back and statements about not finding a lot of undetected cases. I was wondering if that\u2019s related to CDC gearing up for these NPIs. And lastly, talking about the exercising you\u2019ve been doing, what was the weakness or weaknesses that kept coming up in the exercises that you\u2019re most concerned about and you\u2019re really trying to stay on top of now that we have a real time experience happening? Thank you. Okay. So let me \u2014 so let me start by saying that I know the case counts can be confusing. I will try to sort out what the numbers are as of today and try to explain why it perhaps is a little confusing. There remain 14 confirmed U.S. Cases. We are separating out the cases among repatriated individuals. So those are 14 U.S. Cases. 12 of those are travelers who returned from an area where disease is circulating. Two of those are close contacts of another case. That\u2019s 14. There are three novel coronavirus patients among people who are repatriated from Hubei that is in the repatriated flights. And our website says 36 because we updated this yesterday, but in fact as of this morning, there are 40 positives among individuals repatriated from the \u201cDiamond Princess.\u201d so these are Americans who were on board the \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d repatriated back to the United States. And that\u2019s 40. So that means just to go back that there are 14 confirmed cases picked up through the U.S. public health systems. And 40 plus 3 makes 43 among individuals repatriated into the United States. I do hope that helps. In terms of the severity, I think that there are a variety of reports that give information about severity. We\u2019ve looked at severity among people, among reported people from Hubei. We\u2019ve looked at reported people from elsewhere in china. And certainly the data coming out from Korea and Iran and Italy suggests also deaths which are concerning. In terms of our messaging today, I really would say that it is more driven by the community spread in other countries than it is specifically from data from china. And so I think it really is the spreading of COVID-19 through other countries that makes all of us feel that the risk of spread in the united states has \u2014 is increasing. In terms of exercising, you know, there are always small and big things that we learn from exercising. Maybe two specific things I\u2019ll point out is that our exercising did show us that if we had a pandemic, there were going to be supply issues. And I think that we are now across the whole of government thinking through and working on those supply issues. One of them is enough protection for health care workers. This is clearly a priority. The health care workers put themselves on the front line caring for ill patients and has to be a priority to make sure they are protected. Another issue is the NPIs. The non-pharmaceutical interventions. We have worked across governmental sectors to get input into our planning guidance. But it\u2019s one thing to plan for those NPIs. It\u2019s certainly another thing to be able to implement them at a large scale. And I think one of the reasons that we\u2019re talking about this so proactively today is that we recognize that implementing NPIs at this level that we want to prepare the american people that their lives could be interrupted. Next. Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric of ABC news. Your line is open. Thanks, Benjamin. Thanks, Nancy for taking our questions. I\u2019m wondering like the chicken and the egg with the case definition and the testing. If you\u2019re telling us today it\u2019s not a question of if but when there\u2019ll be community spread and it\u2019s very difficult to \u2014 for clinicians to know the difference between flu and COVID-19, how come you\u2019re not widening the case definition to test more people? So let me answer that two ways. One is that we have more than one layer of surveillance. I think I talked about this in a previous call, but maybe just to talk about it a little more. There is a specific patient-under-investigation case definition that really does focus on travel because that is where the cases that are picked up through our public health systems are. But we are also aware and concerned about the possibility for broader spread in the U.S. That\u2019s why the Secretary and we announced last week that we were going to be doing more community-based surveillance relying on the infrastructure of our influenza. So we have already started that surveillance system. We\u2019re rapidly working within the next couple weeks to expand that more broadly. As well, we have a variety of other more community-oriented surveillance systems that we\u2019re working to stand up to be able to look for those cases in the community. So this is proceeding in stages with the one surveillance but community surveillance also rapidly starting. Brittany, we have time for two more questions, please. Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren from San Antonio Express News. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking my call. I wanted to ask about the 14-day incubation period that has been reiterated by many public health officials including the quarantine of the evacuees. We\u2019ve seen some isolated reports coming from other countries suggesting that it is possible that the incubation period has been longer in some individuals in other countries who have been quarantined for more than 14 days. And I was wondering if you guys have any reason to suspect whether the incubation period may be longer than 14 days for those of Wuhan that have been released from their quarantine. Thank you. That\u2019s actually a really important question. And something we\u2019re looking at closely. Some of the reports that you\u2019ve seen are reports in the media, not reports in peer reviewed literature. And it impacts our ability to fully scientifically evaluate them. As I\u2019ve said in previous meetings, there are a team of \u2014 there are more than 50 modeling mathematical modeling groups in the United States all working with us to look at a variety of issues around this response to novel coronavirus. One of the things they\u2019re certainly analyzing is all of the available data on the incubation period. And the data so far still supports using 14 days as the top window. In terms of isolated reports elsewhere, there are a variety of possibilities. One possibility is \u2014 there\u2019s a variety of possibilities \u2013 what we\u2019ll do is continue to synthesize and evaluate the available data trying to make a data-driven decision. And if more data becomes available that suggests a longer incubation period, we will certainly be visible and public about that. I think at this point, we\u2019re still comfortable that 14 days is the appropriate top line for that. Last question, please. Thank you. And our final question comes from Ben from CNN. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. This morning while he was traveling in India, President Trump said that he thinks that the coronavirus is a problem that is going to go away. He seems very optimistic about this and we\u2019re trying to figure out exactly why he believes so strongly that to be the case. And so my question for you is what information is your agency specifically giving the president and the White House about the current state of the coronavirus outbreak? As you imagine, we brief the Secretary daily and the Secretary is the lead of the White House task force. And Ddr. Redfield the CDC director is briefing them daily. In terms of the course of this illness, we have a \u2014 again, a team of mathematical modelers working with us to try to predict the trajectory. One hypothesis is that we could be hopeful that this could potentially be seasonal. Other viral respiratory diseases are seasonal including influenza and therefore in many viral respiratory diseases, we do see a decrease in disease in spring and summer. And so we could certainly be optimistic that this disease will follow suit. But we\u2019re not going to know that until time keeps ticking forward. We\u2019re going to be, again, preparing as if this is going to continue, preparing as if we\u2019re going to see community spread in the near term. But I\u2019m always going to be hopeful that that disease will decline either for the summer or that, you know, we\u2019ll be over-prepared and we won\u2019t see the high levels of transmission here in the U.S. Thank you, doctor. And thank you, all, for joining us for today\u2019s briefing. Please visit CDC\u2019s 2019 novel coronavirus website for continued updates. And if you have further questions, please call the main media line at 404-639-3286 or email media@CDC.gov. Thank you. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Paul Fulton: Thank you all for joining us today for this briefing to update you on the CDC\u2019s COVID-19-19 response. We are joined by director Dr. Robert Redfield and CDC\u2019s incident manager Dr. Jay Butler. Dr. Redfield will give opening remarks and Dr. Butler will discuss an MMWR being released later today as well as suggestions on how to navigate daily life as communities reopen. They will take your questions later. Limit your question to one and limit it to the information being presented today. If you have questions about other topics, contact the CDC media office, media@CDC.gov. At this time I will turn the call over to Dr. Redfield. Robert Redfield: Thank you, Paul. And thank all of you for joining us today. The CDC\u2019s COVID-19-19 response is now in its sixth month. While we are making progress, we have a lot of work ahead as we reopen America. CDC, like the scientific and public health institutions around the world, continue to learn a great deal about this new virus. We focus on how it\u2019s spread among people, how it\u2019s highly transmissible, and how people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic can also contribute to spreading. Our recommendations have evolved based on the new information that becomes available, but it continues to be extremely important that we embrace the recommendations of social distancing, hand-washing, and wearing of face coverings when we are in public as some of the key defenses that we have against this virus. Later during this briefing Dr. Butler is going to discuss the findings of an MMWR that looks at how the American people have responded to these key public health recommendations during the pandemic. Dr. Butler is going to share specifics, but I wanted to take a moment to really say thank you to the American people for basically being selfless in taking on the precautions that we have requested of social distancing, wearing a face covering, and hand hygiene to protect the most vulnerable from the threat of COVID-19. I know the people are eager to return to normal activities and ways of life. However, it\u2019s important that we remember that this situation is unprecedented and that the pandemic has not ended. As I said earlier, it\u2019s going to be critical to continue to embrace the principles of social distancing, hand hygiene, and wearing a face covering in public. That is why today we are releasing some commonsense suggestions people can take to reduce their risk as their communities open up and they reengage in daily life and attend larger gatherings. Each of you have been active responders to this pandemic, making changes in your life and taking on new challenges in the face of this evolving health threat. We recognize how hard some of these changes have been and the consequence some of them have had on individuals and families and communities. So, once again, to the American people, I would like to say thank you for being the individual public health heroes that we need right now to fight this pandemic. Now I\u2019d like to turn this discussion over to Dr. Jay Butler, our COVID-19-19 incident manager, to discuss our recommendation. Jay Butler: Thank you, Dr. Redfield. Good afternoon and good morning, everybody. It\u2019s a pleasure to be able to speak with you today. We are now deep into a global pandemic caused by a virus that we didn\u2019t even know existed only six, seven months ago. So I suppose the bad news today is the pandemic is not over, and it\u2019s important to recognize that. While COVID-19-19 is still making headlines everywhere, we know that the pandemic hasn\u2019t affected everyone everywhere in the same way. The good news is nationally we have been successful in flattening the curve. The number of new cases each day has been relatively plateaued over a prolonged period of time. But right now communities are experiencing different levels of transmission, and this is occurring as they gradually ease up on some of the community mitigation efforts and gradually reopen. We recognize that we are all getting tired of staying at home. People long for the life that they had back in December. As we live \u2014 as we head into the summer months, we know that Americans will be looking forward to reconnecting with family and friends and be able to attend events, and we want that to occur as safely as possible. Today the CDC is releasing two online resources aimed at helping people make decisions about how to resume some activities while continuing to follow many of the public health recommendations that can still help us to all protect ourselves and our communities. Every activity that involves interacting with others has some degree of difficulty right now. We want to provide you with the information and suggestions you need to make decisions about which activities may be able to resume and what level of risk you may have to accept. Here is a general rule of thumb. The more closely you interact with others, the longer the interaction lasts and the greater the number of people involved in the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. Understanding these risks and how to adopt different prevention measures can help you protect yourselves and others against the virus. We continue to ask everyone to follow the guidance of their state and local health authorities and also we all do our part to embrace prevention strategies, including social distancing as much as possible, maintaining a distance of at least six feet from other persons, washing your hands or using an alcohol-based hand cleaner on a regular basis, and wearing a face covering in public where appropriate. We actually practice what we preach here at CDC. So for face coverings we get into the building wearing one. The face covering that I wear, I use this instead of a tie or socks to express my personality. So I have one, a cloth-based covering made with patterns of grizzly bears and salmon on them to show my homage to my home in Alaska. I also have one with an Alaska state flag on it. So these steps of social distancing, hand hygiene, and face covering can help reduce the risk of COVID-19-19 spread and protect those most vulnerable to severe disease. Today we\u2019re releasing the information on our website to help people make informed decisions about whether to go out and what precautions to take if they do. These documents give suggestions on things you can think about and questions you can ask both about how much COVID-19-19 activity there is in your community and what type of event or activity you are considering. We recommend that you get the answers to these questions and consider what they mean when making your decisions. These suggestions also provide practical tips for given situations. For example, when dining out, see if there is an option to sit outside or ensure that the tables are at least six feet apart so you can maintain social distancing. If you hit the gym, don\u2019t share items that can\u2019t be cleaned or sanitized after use, and refrain from high-fives and elbow bumps which involve getting closer than six feet to others. If your local library is open, see if curbside pickup is available. If you want to gather with friends for a cookout, as much as possible use single-serve options and remind guests to wash their hands before and after eating. Maintain social distancing, wear cloth face coverings when possible, practice hand hygiene, and avoid sharing frequently touched items. I recently was able to get together with some friends for the first time in about ten weeks, and it was nice to reconnect, and we were able to do these things and have a safer gathering that way. And, finally, for those interested in larger gatherings, we have also added a page or our website with suggestions to help people planning or attending events or gatherings as they prepare for enjoying larger events. Before we take questions, I want to mention a report that has been published in the MMWR today. The article underscores the fact that American people have taken mitigation efforts seriously to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2, and it demonstrates our country\u2019s collective spirit in responding to the pandemic. This was an online survey involving adults nationwide, and particularly those from New York City and Los Angeles, and this was conducted in May to assess adherence to public health recommendations. Results of the survey showed that respondents generally supported stay-at-home measures and non-essential business closures. They reported often or always wearing face coverings in public areas, and they believe that their state restrictions were the right balance and not \u2014 they believed \u2014 sorry, let me try this again. They agreed that their state\u2019s restrictions were the right balance of being restrictive and not too restrictive. So I want to thank the American people for helping us get through the last few months. This represents an incredible public health achievement, and the American people are responsible for that. The direction of the pandemic is in all of our hands, so let\u2019s wash those hands. And I ask for your continued efforts. I know it\u2019s difficult to make changes to our daily lives. We are not out of the woods yet. In the coming weeks we could see increases in the number of cases of COVID-19 as states reopen and as there is an increase in public gatherings as we move into the summer across the country. It\u2019s too soon to tell if this will happen, but the CDC is working closely with state health departments to monitor the disease activity and to support responses to any increases. In addition, we must look ahead to the fall and winter. While what will happen is uncertain, we have to pull all our efforts towards gearing up for additional potential challenges that we see every fall and winter, and that is influenza. If anything, we must be overprepared for what we might face later this year. Getting a flu vaccine will be more important than ever as flu and COVID-19-19 could be circulating together as we move into the fall and winter months. So I look forward to taking your questions, and with that I will stop. Thank you, everyone. Paul Fulton: Thank you, Dr. Redfield, and thank you, Dr. Butler. We are going to take your questions now. Media, please remember to limit your question to one and limit your question to the information being presented today. If you have questions about other topics, please contact the CDC media office by emailing media@CDC.gov. Operator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin our question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, press star then 1 and record your name clearly when prompted. If you need to withdraw your question, you may do so by pressing star, then 2. Our first question comes from Mike Stobbe from AP. Mike Stobbe: Thank you for taking my call. So there are two sets of guidance. One of them is about holding or attending mass gatherings. That includes political rallies. Can you comment on whether the CDC is saying that political rallies are okay right now? Jay Butler: Yeah, thanks for that question, mike. So, first of all, the guideline is really for any type of gathering, whether it\u2019s the backyard barbecue or something larger. And it\u2019s not intended to endorse any particular type of event, but to be able to be applicable to any type of event that may occur. So the most important things are some of those issues related to being able to maintain social distancing, having access to hand hygiene, encouraging face coverings, and, of course, not attending events if you are ill or have recently been exposed to COVID-19. Paul Fulton: Next question, please. Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Elizabeth Weise from USA Today, your line is now open. Elizabeth Weise: Thanks so much for taking my question. Looking at these guidelines, if the American public were to adhere to these maintaining social distance, hand hygiene, always wearing facemasks when out in public, do you think that we can keep levels of COVID-19 down until we have a vaccine? Is this a viable plan moving forward? Jay Butler: Thanks for that question also. Yes, the whole goal here is to continue to keep that curve as flattened as possible to delay onset of cases for two reasons. First of all, we want to make sure that critical infrastructure that\u2019s important for societal function as well as the availability of health care services is maintained and that none of these services are overwhelmed by a sudden increase in the number of cases. The second item is just what you touched on, is it increases the chances that there will be people who would benefit from a vaccination if they can avoid becoming infected before a vaccine is available. Paul Fulton: Next question, please. Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Betsy McKay from the Wall Street Journal, your line is now open. Betsy McKay: Hi, thanks very much. You know, as you have talked about, there has been a lot learned more about how this virus spreads through contact and large events and so forth. So I wondered, if cases do start going up again, do you think \u2014 would widespread lockdowns be necessary once again? Or what more targeted interventions could be used in these cases? Jay Butler: Yeah, thank you for that question also. So, as we \u2014 the most important thing is to be able to monitor what is happening in terms of people\u2019s activity, what are the \u2014 what is the degree of adherence, and then also monitoring the degree of transmission that\u2019s occurring through disease surveillance. If cases begin to go up again, and particularly if they go up dramatically, it\u2019s important to recognize that more intensive mitigation efforts such as what were implemented in March may be needed again. And that is a decision that really needs to be made locally based on what is happening within the community regarding disease transmission. Again, I\u2019ll return to my opening comment that we know the pandemic is not over. Even looking at some of the serology data, the vast majority of Americans still have not been exposed to this virus. Paul Fulton: Next question, please. Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Lena Sun from the Washington Sun, your line is now open. Lena Sun: Thank you very much for taking my call, Dr. Butler, Dr. Redfield, and I hope we can continue this on a regular basis going forward. Regarding the mass gatherings, president trump has announced that he is going to hit the campaign trail next week. The RNC has also announced they are going to hold a convention and they are not going to ask people to wear masks. Given the considerations that you have put out here about wearing cloth coverings when people are singing or shouting or chanting, I\u2019m wondering whether you need \u2014 whether the CDC is concerned about this way of seeding more infections as people are going to be in a closed indoor space and not wearing masks and what additional suggestions you might have. Jay Butler: Thanks for that easy question, Lena. So the guidelines I think speak for themselves, and they are not regulations. They are not commands. But they are recommendations or even suggestions, is I believe how it\u2019s titled, of how you can have a gathering that will keep people as safe as possible. Paul Fulton: Next question, please. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Vergano from Buzzfeed News, your line is now open. Dan Vergano: Hi, thanks very much. You said it\u2019s too soon to tell if this will happen about outbreaks, if people don\u2019t stick to these measures, but we are seeing signs in some states, Arizona notably, have increases that looks like it\u2019s coming back. Is it too soon to tell if this will happen? The MMWR is embargoed for 1:00 p.m. But you have already sort of blown the results, so I was wondering if we can go ahead and report that? Jay Butler: Regarding the question about there are areas, as I mentioned earlier, where there is an increase in the number of cases that are reported and there is a number of different drivers of that as we contact \u2014 actually, in some places have staff that are boots on the ground assisting our state, local, and tribal partners. Sometimes an increase is driven by increased availability of testing, sometimes it\u2019s driven by outbreaks, and we have seen outbreaks in certain occupational settings, in long-term care facilities. Early on we saw clusters of infections in shelters for people experiencing homelessness, and sometimes there is in-case transmission in the community as well. In each area where we see an uptick, these are the questions we want to explore to determine whether or not it\u2019s an issue of increased infection in the community or are we recognizing more infections through increased testing. It\u2019s important to know, of course, that certain proportion of people who become infected never develop any symptoms. So, as testing has become more widely available, some people are tested without any symptoms. There are a certain proportion of people who will be diagnosed and will help contribute to that increase in the number of cases in any given location. In some locations it will be a combination of all of those factors that are driving the increase. Paul Fulton: Thank you, Dr. Butler. All information presented during this telebriefing is embargoed to 1:00 p.m. Eastern. Next question, please. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Howell from The Washington Times, your line is open. Tom Howell: Thanks for doing the call. I have a question about testing. I wanted to know, we have heard a lot about the volume of testing and allowing people to get a test if they want one. Have you seen any strategies though in states or localities that seem to work in actually reducing transmission and amounts of wise allocation of resources? If so, what do those strategies look like? Thanks. Jay Butler: Sure. First of all, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that testing is not something that in and of itself reduces transmission. It\u2019s been taking the test results and being able to make sure that people who are infected are then able to be isolated and reduce their exposures to other people. Right now we are actually in the process of working with the states on their plans for their strategies for testing, and this is using some of the funding that is available to them through some of the appropriations legislation, and there is a number of innovative ideas out there, including using university public health students to be able to increase the access to testing as well as follow-up of contacts of people who test positive. Other states are using state employees that have recently been laid off. Not laid off, furloughed. They are being brought back to work, to work on these issues. And so it\u2019s really quite a variety of measures that are innovative that have been undertaken by state and local health departments around the country. Paul Fulton: Thank you. Next question, please. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Stein from National Public Radio, your line is now open. Rob Stein: Yeah, hi. Thanks very much for doing this and for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on a question a little while ago. So, yeah, so cases are going up in, you know, maybe 20 states around the country, and so what is CDC\u2019s thoughts about why the cases are going up? As you said, you have boots on the ground. Is this going up primarily because of increase in testing, or is it more that people aren\u2019t following the guidelines? And a lot of public health experts say there has not been enough increase in cases, but I\u2019m curious, what is CDC\u2019s analysis of really what the situation is? Is the virus spreading more right now? The second question is, the country has flattened the curve. It\u2019s at a plateau. That still means 800 or more Americans are dying every day. Over the course of the summer, thousands more could die by the fall. Is that an acceptable level? Jay Butler: Yeah. So, in terms of the first part of the question, as I was saying earlier, it\u2019s going to be variable in different parts of the country. There is no one answer to your question that\u2019s going to apply to every area. So that\u2019s why it takes really a deep dig into the situation to be able to look at that. So in terms of one of the ways we can begin to tease that apart is also to look at rates of hospitalization. Also looking at emergency department utilization for COVID-19-like illness because the test results in and of themselves only reflect a bit of the transmission that\u2019s occurring. We know that some people don\u2019t develop symptoms. We know that of those who develop symptoms, not everyone will be tested. And so we have other ways to look at what are some of the metrics for more severe illness. Are hospitalization rates going up? Are admissions to ICUs increasing? Right now, in looking nationally again, the hospitalization rates are going down, and in most of the places where we have looked at the increase in the recent week or two in the number of cases diagnosed we are not confirming dramatic increases in the number of hospitalizations. This is something that is ongoing and we will continue to monitor very closely. So that\u2019s by no means meant to suggest that this is not something that we\u2019re not very concerned about and will be working on very closely. Robert Redfield: Rob, maybe I\u2019ll add one thing. This is Dr. Redfield. As Jay said, it\u2019s multifactorial. One of the elements in that, and he mentioned each of the states are putting together their strategy, but because of the asymptomatic and presymptomatic presentation of this virus being much more common than was appreciated in the winter, one of the critical features, particularly in protecting people that are vulnerable, is to institute aggressive surveillance by doing antigen testing, viral testing in individual groups that are considered vulnerable. So there has been requests that all individuals that are residents of the 15,000 plus nursing homes in the united states undergo testing to see if there is sub-symptomatic infection. Same with prisons. It\u2019s also been encouraged to be extended to other risk settings, whether it\u2019s certain meat packing plants, homeless populations, urban clinics, and different states to different degrees have operationalized that. Some states have almost tested every nursing home resident. So it\u2019s not explaining everything, but I just, as jay said, it\u2019s multifactorial. Clearly now there has been able to be expanded testing in what we consider vulnerable surveillance populations that I think is also contributing to some of the number increases. Paul Fulton: Thank you, Dr. Redfield. We have time for two more questions. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexandria Kelly from The Hill, your line is now open. Alexandria Kelly: Hi, thank you for taking my call. Really good to hear from you guys again. I wanted to ask about a yahoo news article published June 10th. It said through presumably a leaked document from the CDC that coronavirus infections are spiking in the US. Even as they begin to decline in countries like Brazil and Spain, Italy, and Germany. Do you have any comment on the that? Jay Butler: I haven\u2019t seen that document. Paul Fulton: You can follow up with us media@CDC.gov. Thank you. Next question, please. Operator: Our final question comes from Carl O\u2019Donnell from Reuters, your line is now open. Carl O\u2019Donnell: Hi, this is carl. So I just wanted to ask, there is a number of states, Arizona, Texas, North Carolina have, you know, significantly relaxed social distancing, and what we have seen is that that seems to have translated not only into higher case counts, which could be a function of testing, but also hire hospitalization rates. Do you guys have any concern that some states relaxed their social distancing measures too early? Jay Butler: So I think, first of all, it\u2019s important to recognize that temporal association doesn\u2019t prove causation. That\u2019s one of the reasons we don\u2019t sit back and look at the numbers, but also try to get visibility in the community of what\u2019s actually going on. And your question about hospitalization I think is spot on because that is one of the measures of whether or not there is more severe illness occurring or are we diagnosing more asymptomatic people. So, to reiterate something that Dr. Redfield mentioned, the important surveillance, to be able to understand the evolution of the pandemic is critical. Actually, if I could maybe return a second to the earlier question about rates of disease in the United States versus other areas. It\u2019s important to recognize that the degree of testing and surveillance in other nations actually can be quite different than in the United States. So while there are reports of a number of cases that occur throughout the world, it\u2019s important to note that in some countries there is probably a much greater proportion of cases that go undiagnosed. And overall those numbers are probably a small proportion of the cases that actually occur. Robert Redfield: Let me say one thing, if I could, to everyone who tuned in. I do want to thank all of you. I said this many years ago when I started, several years ago when I started at CDC, that the public and the media that reports really are a critical partner with us in getting the public health information out that we want to get out to the American public. I am hopeful that we will continue to have these dialogues. I just want to thank you for taking the time. I want to thank you for what you do to help communicate the messages that we feel are important to get to the American public. So thank you. Paul Fulton: Thank you, Dr. Redfield. As a reminder, all the information we have shared today is embargoed to 1:00 p.m. Eastern. And we\u2019ll send out an email to the media list including links to these documents. Please continue to check CDC\u2019s website, CDC.gov/COVID-19-19, for the latest updates on our efforts. If you have further questions, please call our media line 404-639-3286 or email media@CDC.gov. Thank you again. Operator: Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. All participants may disconnect at this time.",

For the latest information about COVID-19 including how it spreads, prevention and treatment, and symptoms, visit the CDC\u2019s website. COVID-19 Basics Q: What is COVID-19? A: COVID-19 is a virus strain, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, that has only spread in people since December 2019. Health experts are closely monitoring the situation because little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people. Q: How does COVID-19 spread and what are the symptoms? A: COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets. That means to become infected, you generally must be within six feet of someone who is contagious and come into contact with these droplets. It may be possible to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly eyes. People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear within two to 14 days after exposure and include: Fever or chills. Cough. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue. Muscle or body aches. Headache. New loss of taste or smell. Sore throat. Congestion or runny nose. Nausea or vomiting. Diarrhea. This list does not include all possible symptoms. Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness. Q: How is COVID-19 treated? A: People infected with this virus should receive supportive care such as rest, fluids and fever control, to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. The FDA also granted an emergency use authorization for an investigational antiviral drug remdesivir for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Prevention Q: Is there a vaccine? A: Currently, there is no vaccine available. Q: How can I best protect myself? A: Practice the following: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Wear a face mask to protect yourself and others when you\u2019re out in public. Practice social distancing. Maintain a 6-foot distance from other people. Avoid crowds and groups of people. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Standard household cleansers and wipes are effective in cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces. It\u2019s currently flu and respiratory disease season and CDC recommends getting vaccinated, taking everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed. Q: Should I wear a face mask out in public? A: The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public, especially in places where it\u2019s hard to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and another person. Face masks are being recommended because we now know individuals with COVID-19 could have mild or no symptoms, while still spreading the virus to others. Wearing a mask does not replace the need for physical distancing. The cloth face coverings recommended by the CDC are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders. Q: Why should I wear a face mask? A: The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks for the following reasons: A cloth mask can help individuals cover a cough or sneeze; reducing the spread of germs. A cloth mask will not prevent you from breathing in respiratory droplets which carry a virus, like COVID-19. prevent you from breathing in respiratory droplets which carry a virus, like COVID-19. Some people with COVID-19 have mild to no symptoms, and may be spreading the virus unknowingly. Cloth masks could help cut down how far the virus spreads. Cloth masks can prevent you from touching your face, and can be a visual reminder to practice social distancing. Learn more about why it is important to wear a mask Q: Are pregnant women at higher risk of developing severe illness with COVID-19? A: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it\u2019s not yet known whether pregnant women are more susceptible to getting COVID-19 or are likely to have more severe symptoms, compared with individuals of a similar age and health status, who aren\u2019t pregnant. However, it\u2019s still important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses. Q: Can pregnant women with COVID-19 pass the virus to their fetus or newborn? A: There are currently no studies that show evidence the virus can be passed from mother to fetus before delivery. A report in The Lancet medical journal looked at nine pregnant women in China in their third trimester with pneumonia caused by COVID-19. None of the mothers developed severe illness. Two babies did show some signs of distress, but all nine babies were born alive and fairly healthy. Additionally, they all tested negative for coronavirus. Doctors still aren\u2019t sure how the disease might affect women and developing babies earlier in pregnancy, during the first trimester. High fevers in early pregnancy can increase the risk of some birth defects, however, little is known regarding how that affects pregnant women with COVID-19. Access and Visitor Restrictions in Ohio Locations Q: Are all Cleveland Clinic emergency departments open? A: Yes, all Cleveland Clinic emergency departments remain open for care. We encourage the public to seek immediate medical attention for symptoms that suggest serious medical emergencies, such as stroke or heart attack. All patients coming to our emergency departments are screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Face masks are strongly recommended for patients and required for permitted visitors, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. We will provide individuals a mask or they can bring their own from home. Any patients with COVID-19 symptoms are taken to a designated area within the emergency department for care. Q: I have an appointment at Cleveland Clinic, and I am concerned about COVID-19. What safety measures are in place to protect me?  A: The safety of our patients and caregivers remains our top priority. We want to assure patients that our Cleveland Clinic facilities are safe for them to receive care. We have taken steps to increase safety by: Limiting visitors to our facilities. Screening everyone for potential COVID-19 symptoms. Providing essential personal protective equipment (PPE) for caregivers. Practicing physical distancing. Expanding testing capabilities. Continuing to clean and disinfect surfaces frequently. Requiring our caregivers to wear face shields and masks in clinical areas. Requiring permitted visitors to wear masks at all times while inside our facilities, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. Requiring patients to wear a mask for all routine appointments and procedures, which don\u2019t require a hospital stay, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. Strongly encouraging inpatients and Emergency Department patients to wear a mask inside our facilities. If you\u2019re unsure about keeping your appointment, contact your physician\u2019s office to see if other options are available. For patients who require a physical exam, in-person appointments will remain as scheduled. Our clinicians are meeting regularly to closely monitor this evolving situation. If you have a fever, cough, diarrhea or shortness of breath, or are otherwise concerned you have COVID-19, we ask you do not come to any Cleveland Clinic facility. Start with a virtual visit using Cleveland Clinic Express Care\u00ae Online, an eVisit questionnaire in MyChart or call your primary care physician. Patients will then be evaluated to determine if they require being seen in person or if they meet CDC guidelines for COVID-19 testing based on symptoms, travel and exposures. If a patient meets criteria for testing, their provider or primary care physician will advise them with next best steps. Q: Can I bring someone with me to my scheduled appointment? A: For Ohio and Florida locations: At this time, no guests or visitors are permitted to accompany adult patients, unless special assistance is required. Pediatric patients, elderly patients and those with special needs are permitted to bring no more than one guest. No more than two guests will be permitted per family or group. Visitors who are sick, have a fever, or a confirmed case of COVID-19 should not visit or accompany a patient. Visitors must wash their hands (or use sanitizer) before and after entering clinical areas and waiting rooms. Q: How are pediatric hospital services affected? A: After a brief suspension in services to prepare for a potential surge in adult patients with COVID-19, Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s has resumed full pediatric inpatient care at Fairview Hospital . The pediatric emergency departments, newborn nurseries and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) at Fairview and Hillcrest hospitals have remained open, as has the pediatric psychiatry unit at Fairview Hospital. Full pediatric care is also available at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s main campus, Hillcrest Hospital and Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital for Rehabilitation . Q: When is Cleveland Clinic resuming appointments, and how will I know if my scheduled surgery or procedure changes? A: For Ohio and Florida: We\u2019ve resumed outpatient appointments, surgeries and procedures that were paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Ohio, we are reinstating all surgeries and procedures in a phased approach under Ohio Department of Health guidelines. In Florida, we are adding surgeries and procedures to those we were still performing under the Florida Department of Health guidelines that were deemed medically necessary. If your appointment or procedure was delayed, we\u2019ll reach out to you to reschedule. You can also visit our Appointments & Access page for up-to-date information. If you have a surgery or procedure scheduled that will be performed in any of our ambulatory surgery centers or operating rooms, you will be tested for COVID-19 beforehand. If you\u2019re diagnosed with COVID-19, only an urgent or emergency procedure will be performed due to increased health risks. Q: What restrictions are in place for visitors going to Cleveland Clinic facilities? A. In order to protect our patients, caregivers and community and to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we are making changes to our visitation policy. When entering a Cleveland Clinic facility, visitors will have their temperature checked for a fever. This is an additional step to help keep our patients and caregivers safe. In some locations, we use no-contact, hand-held thermal scanners. In other places, we use a thermal imaging system people walk through and might not even notice. We also ask our visitors to respect social distancing and practice hand hygiene. Face masks are required for patients at all routine appointments and procedures, without a hospital stay, and for permitted visitors. Face masks are strongly encouraged for patients admitted to the hospital and Emergency Department patients, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. Visitors may bring their own mask from home, or masks will be provided to them upon entering our facilities. Visitors to patients with COVID-19 must wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Inpatient Locations We have updated our visitor guidelines for all hospital locations in Ohio and Florida*. Adult patients who are COVID-19 negative or asymptomatic may choose one individual to be their designated visitor. A designated visitor may visit once a day for the duration of the patient\u2019s hospital stay. This individual must show their ID at the building entrance to verify identity before each daily visit. Designated visitors may leave the patient\u2019s room to visit the cafeteria or other appropriate areas inside the hospital during each daily visit. In inpatient and outpatient settings, pediatric patients who are COVID-19 negative or asymptomatic are allowed two parents or guardians each day during their hospital stay. At Cleveland Clinic Weston, no guests or visitors are permitted in the MICU and Observation Unit. In the following inpatient settings and situations, additional exceptions may apply to patients who are COVID-19 positive or under investigation for COVID-19: Change in condition for emergency patients: One visitor outside the room during hospital stay. One visitor outside the room during hospital stay. Life-changing diagnosis: One visitor during hospital stay. One visitor during hospital stay. Pediatric patients: One parent or guardian each day during their hospital stay. One parent or guardian each day during their hospital stay. Patients being discharged from the hospital: One person pick-up. One person pick-up. Labor and delivery: One visitor during labor One visitor during labor End-of-life circumstances: Pediatrics: Two parents (or guardian) visitors for end of life, during hospital stay. Adult: One visitor during hospital stay. Surgery requiring an overnight stay: One visitor on the day of surgery and one visitor on the day after surgery. Please note: This guideline does not apply to patients who hospitalized for a solid organ transplant, and adult patients on behavioral health units. Pediatric patients on behavioral health units will be allowed two parent, or guardian, visitors. Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals New COVID-19 pandemic visitor hours are in effect at Cleveland Clinic Rehabilitation Hospitals. One visitor will be permitted per patient, per day from 2:30 \u2013 6:30 pm. The safety and health of our patients, staff and the community remain our top priority. To that end, it is important to thoroughly review our updated visitation guidelines and screening process prior to arrival. Emergency Departments For emergency room locations in Ohio: Patients who are COVID-19 negative and asymptomatic: One designated visitor allowed during emergency room stay. Please note: For emergency room locations, a visit is being defined as having one, single visitor in the patient\u2019s room. The visitor may not leave and later re-enter the room. For emergency room locations in Florida: Cleveland Clinic Florida is not permitting visitors for adult patients, unless the patient requires special assistance. Pediatric patients may have one parent or guardian accompany them. Outpatient Locations We have updated our visitor guidelines for all family health centers, medical office buildings and physician offices in Ohio and Florida. Adult patients having a major surgery or procedure \u2013 defined as those requiring sedation \u2013 and pregnant mothers receiving a fetal ultrasound may designate one single individual as their visitor on the day of the procedure. (For pregnant mothers, this designated visitor could be their child\u2019s father, their partner or designated companion.) In most inpatient and outpatient settings*, pediatric patients who are COVID-19 negative or asymptomatic are allowed two parents or guardians each day during their hospital stay. *Cleveland Clinic Weston is allowing pediatric patients to be accompanied by one parent or guardian during outpatient appointments. For all family health centers, medical office buildings and physician offices in Ohio and Florida*, no guests or visitors are permitted to accompany adult patients to lab work, imaging or routine outpatient appointments. Exceptions are made if you need special assistance, or if your provider has asked you to bring a responsible adult to your appointment or procedure. Social and physical distancing must be maintained in these areas. Special assistance can include, but is not limited to: Drivers Someone to manage a wheelchair or other special needs. Someone to help provide life-changing diagnosis information. Elderly patients, patients with cancer and those with special needs are permitted to bring one guest. For All Permitted Visitors: Anyone who is sick, has a fever, or a confirmed case of COVID-19 should not visit or accompany a patient. Visitors must be over 18 and be fever- and symptom-free. All visitors to patients with COVID-19 must wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). All visitors are required to wear a mask while inside our facilities, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. Masks from home may be worn, or masks will be provided at entrances. Visitors to inpatient settings will not be permitted to enter our facilities between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. unless a compassionate exception applies. Designated visitors must show a photo ID at the entrance to verify identity. Upon entering our facilities, visitors will continue to be thermal screened, required to wear a mask, asked screening questions upon entry into Ohio locations and asked to sanitize their hands before and after entering clinical areas and waiting rooms. To help maintain physical distancing, visitors must limit the number of items they bring when visiting a patient at our facilities. Q: I have an appointment at Cleveland Clinic. What do I need to bring? A: Please bring your appointment reminder with you (email, MyChart or text message). When entering any Cleveland Clinic location, you and any permitted visitors (see visitor restrictions) will be screened for potential COVID-19 symptoms, including a temperature scan. In some locations, we use no-contact, hand-held thermal scanners. In other places, we use a thermal imaging system you walk through and might not even notice. You\u2019ll be asked to sanitize your hands. For a routine appointment or procedure, without a hospital stay, patients are required to wear a mask while inside our facilities, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. Patients admitted to the hospital and Emergency Department patients are strongly encouraged to wear a mask while inside our Ohio and Florida facilities. Masks from home may be worn, or masks will be provided at entrances. COVID-19 Testing Q: Is there an online screening tool available? A: Yes. Cleveland Clinic launched a free COVID-19 screening tool to find out your risk level based on symptoms and travel. Follow these steps: Visit ClevelandClinic.org Click \u201cStart your screening now\u201d A questionnaire window will open Answer questions to receive your recommendations Q: What patients are being prioritized for testing? A: COVID-19 testing will focus on high-risk patients. These are symptomatic patients who also have one of the following criteria: Patients 61 & older Patients under 36 months On immunosuppressive therapy Cancer End-stage renal disease and are on dialysis Diabetes Hypertension Coronary artery disease Heart failure reduced ejection fraction Lung disease Contact with a known COVID-19 patient HIV/AIDS Solid organ transplants These patients will continue to be tested at Cleveland Clinic testing sites with a Cleveland Clinic physician\u2019s order. All patients with scheduled surgeries or procedures that will take place in an ambulatory surgery center or operating room will be tested for COVID-19 before their surgery or procedure. They will be given a date and time for a testing appointment. We have several testing locations throughout northeast Ohio, and will work with the patient to schedule an appointment at a location most convenient for them. Testing is open 11 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m., seven days a week. A Cleveland Clinic electronic provider\u2019s order is required for COVID-19 testing. It will be important to practice the following precautions to help prevent COVID-19 until the test result comes back and until the time of surgery: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 15-20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Practice social and physical distancing by staying 6 feet away from others. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public, especially in places where it\u2019s hard to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and another person. Face masks are being recommended because we now know individuals with COVID-19 could have mild or no symptoms, while still spreading the virus to others. Wearing a face mask does not replace the need for physical distancing. Standard household cleansers and wipes are effective in cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces. Q: What if I am not a high-risk patient and need to receive testing? A: For patients aged 3 \u2013 60, who already have a Cleveland Clinic physician\u2019s order, we are re-evaluating our ability to provide COVID-19 testing and are asking they not report to the testing facilities until they are contacted by Cleveland Clinic with further instructions. Q: Why do I need a test when I\u2019m not showing any symptoms? A: One way we maintain a safe environment for our patients and caregivers is by requiring patients to undergo COVID-19 testing within three days prior to any surgery or procedure in a Cleveland Clinic operating room, ambulatory surgery center and select locations. Recently published data in The Lancet supports our pre-operative testing requirement. The study found that asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 were at higher risk of post-operative complications. By requiring patients to complete pre-operative testing, we help protect our patients and caregivers. Q: How do I get a COVID-19 test if required pre-surgery? A: All patients with scheduled surgeries or procedures taking place in a Cleveland Clinic ambulatory surgery center or operating room will be tested for COVID-19 within three days, or 72 hours, prior to their surgery or procedure date. When a surgery or procedure is scheduled, a COVID-19 test will also be ordered. We have several testing locations, throughout Northeast Ohio and Florida, designated for patients who have an upcoming surgery or procedure. An appointment for the COVID-19 test will be scheduled at a location and time most convenient for the patient. Q: If I\u2019m a candidate for testing, where should I go? A: Ohio:  Testing Locations: On-site testing is located in the garage of the W.O. Walker Building at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s main campus, at Akron General Akron Health Center and at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Akron General Health and Wellness Center in Green.

A: For patients in the hospital, and those tested in our Emergency Departments who are considered very ill or at risk, results are available on average within 24 hours. For patients being tested at our drive-thru facility, results are available on average within a few days. Patients are asked to remain at home until their test results are released. Once processed, COVID-19 test results will now be available immediately in a patient\u2019s MyChart, our secure online health management tool. Q: What do I do if I have flu-like symptoms and think I have been exposed to COVID-19? A: Based on your symptoms, do the following: If you\u2019re concerned you have COVID-19, we recommend you start with a virtual visit using Cleveland Clinic Express Care\u00ae Online, an eVisit questionnaire in MyChart*, or call or message your primary care physician. You will be advised what to do next. Call ahead before going in person to any Cleveland Clinic location. If you have chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, a severe headache or other potentially life-threatening problems, go to the nearest emergency department or call 911. For questions, Call Ohio Department of Health\u2019s 24/7 hotline at 833.4.ASK.ODH. Cleveland Clinic patients call 855.697.3750.* For eVisits: Patients must be a current MyChart user and in the state of Ohio. After completing a questionnaire, Cleveland Clinic providers will review your submitted answers and evaluate your illness. If the provider suspects you may be infected with COVID-19, they will determine the most appropriate place to have your symptoms evaluated, ensuring you get the right care and minimizing spread. Q: How are patients being screened for COVID-19? A: We are following CDC recommendations on screening all Cleveland Clinic patients for potential COVID-19 symptoms and travel from high-risk countries. Screening occurs when you enter any Cleveland Clinic facility and in these areas: Check-in, registration and scheduling. Emergency departments, labor and delivery and surgical areas. Check-in kiosks and MyChart\u2019s pre-check-in feature. Intensive care units. Preparedness Q: What safety measures has Cleveland Clinic implemented to help ensure the safety of patients who need care? A: During this unprecedented time, Cleveland Clinic has taken a number of steps to help limit the spread of COVID-19 and ensure our hospitals are safe for caregivers and patients. This includes providing appropriate personal protective equipment for caregivers, offering face masks to patients, visitors, caregivers and vendors, limiting access into our facilities, restricting visitation, canceling public events and performing temperature checks on everyone who enters our doors. Checking temperature for a fever is an additional step to help keep our patients and caregivers safe. In some locations, we use no-contact, hand-held thermal scanners. In other places, we use a thermal imaging system people walk through and might not even notice. Q: How is Cleveland Clinic preparing for a surge of patients with COVID-19? A: We continue to see COVID-19 patients admitted throughout our health system. None of our hospitals are at or over capacity at this time. We continue to be prepared for a potential surge of patients with COVID-19. As part of this, Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Reserve University temporarily converted the main building on the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic into a fully functioning surge hospital to treat COVID-19 patients not requiring high levels of care but who are in need of hospitalization. Q: What are Cleveland Clinic\u2019s mask guidelines? A: As we learn more about COVID-19 and its transmission, we are adapting our practices in order to provide the safest care to our patients and protect our caregivers. In alignment with guidelines from the CDC and direction from our state and local governments, we are requiring all caregivers in all our locations to wear face masks while inside our facilities. Face masks are required for patients at all routine appointments and procedures, without a hospital stay, and for permitted visitors. Face masks are strongly encouraged for patients admitted to the hospital and Emergency Department patients, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. Patients and permitted visitors will be given a mask to wear the entire time they are in our facilities. They may choose to bring their own masks from home. Q: How can members of the community in Ohio help with supplies? A: In response to the Northeast Ohio community\u2019s generous requests to provide assistance during the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, Cleveland Clinic launched a COVID-19 Community Response Campaign. Q: Where can I find more information from Cleveland Clinic? A: The latest information on COVID-19 can be found on the CDC\u2019s website and at ClevelandClinic.org. Q: Is there a hotline I can call for more information on COVID-19? A: Cleveland Clinic has a dedicated, 24/7 COVID-19 hotline to answer your questions at 855.697.3750. The Ohio Department of Health also has set up a COVID-19 hotline (1-833-4-ASK-ODH) for those with questions or concerns.

It\u2019s caused by an infection with the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is one of multiple coronaviruses that can be transmitted to humans. Other examples of coronaviruses include SARS, MERS, and even the common cold. COVID-19 cases Globally, there have been more than 20.1 million confirmed cases and over 738,000 associated deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. The United States currently has the highest reported number of confirmed cases with more than 5.1 million. However, due to a lack of testing, the number of actual cases may be far higher. More than 164,000 people in the United States have died from the disease and over 45,000 are currently hospitalized. Healthline will update this page every weekday. For more information about the virus, go here. Russia says they will start administering COVID-19 vaccine despite lack of evidence Despite not finishing vital medical trials, the Russian government said they will start administering a COVID-19 vaccine this fall, according to the New York Times. The government hasn\u2019t reported data from vital phase 3 trials where tens of thousands of people are given either the vaccine or placebo. Those trials are critical for verifying that a vaccine or medication is effective and for identifying potential side effects. Health experts in the United States said they\u2019re concerned that the vaccine could cause more mistrust in vaccines in general or give people a false sense of security. Dr. Scott Gottleib, the former FDA commissioner, said that the news may be part of a Russian effort to undermine or cast doubt on a vaccine approved in the United States. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t take it certainly outside the clinical trial right now,\u201d Gottlieb said on CNBC. He also pointed out that a similar vaccine being tested in Canada hasn\u2019t seen very promising results and that it\u2019s not clear how effective this Russian vaccine is. Tweet Nearly 100,000 children test positive for COVID-19 in just 2 weeks A major study found a significant number of children have tested positive for COVID-19 in just a couple of weeks. Over 97,000 children tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 2 weeks of July, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association. This marks a 40 percent increase in pediatric cases. In total, more than 338,000 children have contracted COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The AAP report was released as many school districts around the country grapple with starting the new school year. Some school districts in places like California and Chicago have said they will start school remotely. Others are planning to have at least some students return to the classroom. In Georgia, where classes have resumed in some districts, at least 9 COVID-19 cases have been reported in a school district that reopened last week. When children develop COVID-19 they appear to have fewer severe symptoms than adults. However, they\u2019re not immune to the virus and can spread the disease to other more vulnerable people. Additionally, children can have serious and even severe symptoms of the virus. While rare, some children have died after developing COVID-19. Share on Pinterest N.Y. governor says nation\u2019s largest school district can reopen Governor Andrew Cuomo announced August 7 that New York public schools can reopen if they\u2019re in an area where the testing positivity rate is below 5 percent. This means that public schools in New York City, the largest school district in the nation, could potentially reopen. While New York was the original epicenter for COVID-19 in the United States, it now has some of the lowest infection rates in the country. While Cuomo allowed schools to take steps to reopen, school districts will ultimately decide whether or not to reopen. They will then need to submit reopening plans to the state to get the final approval. Tweet School reopenings in Georgia have already run into issues after some students and staff tested positive for COIVD-19 leading to more quarantines. Model predicts nearly 300,000 deaths from COVID-19 in US by December 1 A model to predict the spread of COVID-19 now estimates the related death toll could surpass 295,000 in the United States by the end of the year. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), an independent global health research center at the University of Washington, has been analyzing data from the COVID-19 pandemic for months. Their model\u2019s projections for the number of COVID-19 fatalities has changed over time as the disease initially waned and then surged when states reopened this summer. Now with the disease widespread in much of the country, their estimated death toll is over 295,000 by December 1. This projection could change again if more people adopt social distancing measures and wear masks. Los Angeles may cut off water and power to houses that host parties during pandemic Mayor Eric Garcetti said officials may cut off water and power to houses if they see they\u2019re hosting large gatherings in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Garcetti said the order wouldn\u2019t target small gatherings but places that have hosted large gatherings multiple times. \u201cThese are focused on the people determined to break the rules, posing significant public dangers and a threat to all of us,\u201d Garcetti said during a COVID-19 news conference, according to CNN. Television news crews shot footage of a large party in the Hollywood Hills earlier this week and officials said it wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Additionally, county health officials said they\u2019re also investigating a potential superspreader event linked to three fraternities at the University of Southern California. Los Angeles has been dealing with a surge in COVID-19 cases in recent months. Los Angeles County has nearly 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases and over 4,800 related deaths. School in Georgia reports COVID-19 case after reopening One day after reopening for the new academic year, a school in Georgia is disinfecting a classroom after a second-grade student tested positive for COVID-19. The student\u2019s class and teacher are currently quarantined and the school is being cleaned, according to NBC News. The infection shows how difficult school reopenings are likely to be as COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States. While many school districts don\u2019t start the school year until later this month or September, schools in parts of Georgia have already reopened. The reopened schools have already made headlines. A photo of a crowded hallway in a high school went viral on social media this week as it showed few students wearing masks. Share on Pinterest Parents are trying to figure out how to send kids back to school safely. Getty Images States want federal government to make COVID-19 treatment more affordable California State Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Lousiana State Attorney General Jeff Landry are asking the federal government to step in and lower the cost for the COVID-19 treatment remdesivir. The drug remdesivir is an antiviral and one of only a few treatments for COVID-19 that appears to decrease mortality. The drug is produced by Gilead Pharmaceutical and is priced at about $3,200 per treatment. Becerra and Landry want the federal government to get involved and license remdesivir to third party pharmaceutical companies in order to increase access and affordability. Under the Bayh\u2013Dole Act, the NIH and FDA are allowed to step in and ensure affordable access to a drug like remdesivir in an emergency. \u201cAmericans ill from COVID-19 should have options in their medical treatment, and today\u2019s petition will hopefully ensure they can access and afford remdesivir,\u201d said Landry in a statement. \u201cDespite millions and millions of taxpayer-funded assistance, Gilead has neither established a reasonable price nor met the health and safety needs of the public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo our bipartisan coalition is calling on the federal government to exercise its rights to help increase the supply of remdesivir and lower its price.\u201d Share on Pinterest COVID-19 outbreak found on cruise ship in the arctic A Norwegian cruise line is reporting an outbreak of COVID-19 on a ship currently north of the Arctic circle. The Hurtigruten cruise line reported that there are at least 41 people with COVID-19 on ship MS Roald Amundsen. The ship is currently far north in Norway. According to CBS News, there have been 36 crew members and 5 passengers who developed COVID-19. However, since the ship stopped at multiple ports in the far northern region of Norway, authorities are concerned that the virus could have been spread at multiple sites. They\u2019re asking anyone who was in contact with people onboard the ship to reach out to local authorities. Share on Pinterest Deborah Birx says COVID-19 is \u2018extraordinarily widespread\u2019 in U.S. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, told CNN on Sunday, August 2, that the COVID-19 pandemic has reached a new phase in the country with rural areas being affected in addition to urban areas. \u201cTo everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not immune or protected from this virus,\u201d Birx said on CNN. \u201cIf you\u2019re in multi-generational households, and there\u2019s an outbreak in your rural area or in your city, you need to really consider wearing a mask at home, assuming that you\u2019re positive, if you have individuals in your households with comorbidities.\u201d Birx also said the virus was \u201cextraordinarily widespread\u201d and that schools shouldn\u2019t open if they\u2019re in states where the testing positivity rate is over 5 percent. Sleepaway camp for kids the site of major COVID-19 outbreak The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Friday that a sleepaway camp for kids and teens became the site of a major COVID-19 outbreak, showing again that the disease can spread even among young people. In the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , CDC researchers reported a COVID-19 outbreak in Georgia at an overnight camp. Nearly 600 camp counselors and campers attended the camp at the end of June. The camp had adhered to state rules designed to limit outbreaks, including mandatory negative COVID-19 tests for campers and counselors. But while counselors had mask requirements, campers weren\u2019t required to wear them. Of the 597 campers and counselors present, at least 260 developed COVID-19. Camp counselors were most likely to contract the virus. The researchers reported that this is another sign that the disease can spread among children, even if they are asymptomatic. \u201cThese findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 spread efficiently in a youth-centric overnight setting, resulting in high attack rates among persons in all age groups, despite efforts by camp officials to implement most recommended strategies to prevent transmission,\u201d the research authors wrote. \u201cAsymptomatic infection was common and potentially contributed to undetected transmission, as has been previously reported,\u201d they said. Children may carry 100 times as much virus as adults A new study out this week found that children may carry far more viral material in their nose and throat than adults. The study , published in JAMA Pediatrics, looked at nasal swabs from children and adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The researchers found children had as much viral material in their swabs as adults \u2014 and sometimes up to 100 times more. While other studies have found that very young children are less likely to spread the virus that causes COVID-19, this new research shows that these children are still very much at risk for spreading the disease. Experts say these findings should be another factor that\u2019s considered as the debate on opening schools continues. \u201cThe school situation is so complicated \u2014 there are many nuances beyond just the scientific one,\u201d Dr. Taylor Heald-Sargent, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago, who led the study, told the New York Times. \u201cBut one takeaway from this is that we can\u2019t assume that just because kids aren\u2019t getting sick, or very sick, that they don\u2019t have the virus.\u201d Herman Cain dies due complications from COVID-19 Former presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after being hospitalized for COVID-19.

Getty Images \u201cHerman Cain \u2014 our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us \u2014 has passed away,\u201d Calabrese wrote. \u201cWe knew when he was first hospitalized with COVID-19 that this was going to be a rough fight.\u201d \u201cHe had trouble breathing and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. We all prayed that the initial meds they gave him would get his breathing back to normal, but it became clear pretty quickly that he was in for a battle,\u201d continued Calabrese. Cain\u2019s death has put a spotlight on political rallies after he attended President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa which didn\u2019t require attendees to wear a mask. Cain was photographed at the event without a mask, but it\u2019s unclear if he developed the disease while at the rally. Cain, the former CEO of the Godfather pizza chain, made headlines when he ran for president in 2012. He was 74 years old. Texas congressman tests positive for COVID-19 after not wearing mask Rep. Louis Gohmert has tested positive for COVID-19 according to his office. Gohmert, a Republican congressman from Texas, was supposed to fly with President Donald Trump on Wednesday when he tested positive. The congressman had told CNN in the past that he didn\u2019t wear a mask because he was being tested regularly. According to Politico, Gohmert has been attending meetings in the capital without a mask. Yesterday he was filmed without a mask at a congressional hearing with Attorney General William Barr. Wearing a mask is increasingly shown to be an effective way to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

Cases are on the upswing in Belgium, France, Germany, and Spain according to the Washington Post. Some countries are pulling back again after reopening. In Spain, nightclubs and gyms are closed in Barcelona and a popular beach is also being closed. In France, the government is now mandating that everyone wear face masks while in shops or indoor venues. The Belgium Prime Minister has now outlined a variety of new measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. These include limiting contact to people outside your home to only 5 other households. People can only stay inside a store for 30 minutes at a time, and they must shop alone. Study finds evidence that drug for autoimmune issues may help fight COVID-19 symptoms A new study finds evidence that a drug originally designed to treat autoimmune diseases and types of lymphoma may help treat COVID-19. Published in the journal Nature , the study found that the drug called LAM-002A may help stop the virus that causes COVID-19 from replicating. The study looked at infected cells in a lab so further tests need to be done in people to see if the drug is an effective way to combat COVID-19. According to a press release by Yale University, the drug may also be combined with remdesivir to treat COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccine trial in US reaches critical phase 3 A major vaccine trial is underway in the United States with researchers planning on involving at least 30,000 participants. Those involved in the study will be divided into two groups with one group getting the experimental vaccine candidate and another group getting a placebo. According to CNN, people who are part of the trial will get two doses of either the vaccine candidate or the placebo over 28 days to see how their immune system reacts. A phase 3 trial is designed to verify that a medication or vaccine is effective, safe, and find out its effective dosage. The vaccine has been developed by Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This trial is just one of at least 2 dozen going on globally in the hunt to find an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Despite the early good news about a potential COVID-19 vaccine, it is possible this vaccine will not be approved for use. In the past, many drugs can appear effective in phase 1 or 2 trials only to be found ineffective or dangerous in phase 3 trials. Share on Pinterest Experts urge second shutdown in U.S. as COVID-19 cases climb Over 100 medical experts signed an open letter urging U.S. government leaders to shut down the country in an effort to stop COVID-19 cases and deaths. The letter, posted by the U.S. PIRG (Public Interest Research Groups), cited climbing COVID-19 cases in multiple states as a reason to shut down again. According to the authors, without another shutdown it will be extremely difficult to stop the virus. \u201cWe need that protocol in place until case numbers recede to a level at which we have the capacity to effectively test and trace,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThen, and only then, we can try a little more opening, one small step at a time.\u201d The authors said much more testing is needed to reopen safely. \u201cWe currently have only 35 percent of the testing capacity we need to meet that threshold. The more people get sick, the more testing is required,\u201d they wrote. Additionally, they point out more contact tracers are needed to determine who has been exposed to the virus. They also said that more personal protective equipment (PPE) is needed to safeguard medical professionals. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take these actions, the consequences will be measured in widespread suffering and death,\u201d the authors wrote. COVID-19 cases top 4 million in US The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage in the United States with no clear end in sight. The number of U.S. people who have tested positive for COVID-19 has now reached over 4 million. July has seen a serious surge in positive COVID-19 tests. While it took months from the start of the outbreak to hit 3 million COVID-19 cases, the last 1 million took just over 2 weeks. States across the country are recording record daily highs of hospitalizations and deaths. The United States currently has the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Brazil, which has about two-thirds of the U.S. population, comes in second for COVID-19 cases and deaths. That country has documented over 2.2 million COVID-19 and over 82,000 deaths. Poll finds 3 out of 4 Americans support mask requirements A new poll from the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that a large majority \u2014 or about 3 out of 4 Americans \u2014 support requiring people to wear masks while outside. The study results come as the United States is seeing new record high cases of COVID-19. The country is nearing 4 million cases with over 140,000 deaths. While mask wearing has become politicized, the study found that the majority of both Democrats (83 percent) and Republicans (58 percent) support mask requirements. A vast majority of Americans \u2014 about 95 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of Republicans \u2014 say they\u2019re donning face coverings when they leave their home. Health authorities have supported wearing facial coverings like masks to slow the spread of COVID-19. Share on Pinterest Some cities may have to shut down again as COVID-19 spreads. Getty Images Red Cross running low on convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients The American Red Cross announced July 22 that they\u2019re running out of vital convalescent plasma used to treat people with COVID-19. The plasma is taken from people who have already recovered from the illness and have crucial antibodies that can help fight the virus. With the surge in COVID-19 cases in the United States, the Red Cross says there\u2019s more demand for the plasma than supply. \u201cIt is critical that COVID-19 survivors give their antibody-rich plasma now to ensure this blood product is available to help those actively battling this coronavirus,\u201d Dr. Pampee Young, chief medical officer of American Red Cross Biomedical Services said in a statement. \u201cConvalescent plasma has been used for decades as a potentially lifesaving treatment until virus or disease specific treatments and vaccines are developed,\u201d Young continued. \u201cIt remains crucially important today in the fight against this COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d A lack of testing access has compounded the plasma shortage. If people are unable to be tested when they have the disease, they may not be able to donate plasma after they recover. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 and want to donate plasma can learn more about the process here. Over 100,000 people volunteer to take part in COVID-19 vaccine trials In just 2 weeks, at least 138,000 people have volunteered to be studied in COVID-19 vaccine trials, according to Forbes. The National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) put out a call this month for volunteers to take part in vaccine trials this fall. At least 120,000 people are needed to take part in four different vaccine trials that will examine the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. \u201cWhile this early response is very gratifying, it is important to note that this is just a fraction of the number of people needed to participate in various trials and ensure adequate representation of various demographic categories,\u201d a spokesperson for the NIAID told Forbes.

Getty Images Actual COVID-19 rate may be 10 times higher than current number A study published July 21 in JAMA Internal Medicine found evidence that the number of Americans who have developed COVID-19 may be 10 times higher than the reported number. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined samples from over 1,600 people in multiple states to look for signs of COVID-19 antibodies. Researchers found the percentage of people with COVID-19 antibodies ranged widely from state to state with nearly 7 percent of people in New York having antibodies while only 1 percent of people in San Francisco having them. Researchers estimate that the actual number of COVID-19 cases is likely 10 times higher than the recorded number, which may be due to people with mild or no symptoms. \u201cThe findings may reflect the number of persons who had mild or no illness or who did not seek medical care or undergo testing but who still may have contributed to ongoing virus transmission in the population,\u201d the study authors wrote. Additionally, many people with symptoms have been unable to get tested for the disease due to a lack of supplies. Researchers investigate potential new treatment for COVID-19 A new study published July 20 found that a commonly available treatment may help people with COVID-19 recover. The treatment is interferon beta, a type of protein that\u2019s traditionally used to treat people with multiple sclerosis. In the UK-based study, researchers had people with COVID-19 inhale the interferon beta. The researchers reportedly found that people who were given the treatment had a 79 percent decreased chance of dying or having severe COVID-19. However, experts caution that the study was small with only 101 people involved. Additionally, researchers haven\u2019t released full data, which has drawn criticism from experts, according to the New York Times. Another study is being planned for the United States with around 400 participants. Share on Pinterest At least 49 Florida hospitals are out of ICU beds The COVID-19 surge has led to Florida hospitals running out of room to treat patients. At least 49 hospitals in Florida have run out of room in their ICUs, according to a state database. As hospitals run out of ICU space, patients will have to be transferred to other facilities around the state or even out of state for treatment. The situation doesn\u2019t look likely to improve in the coming days or weeks. In just the last 5 days, Florida has reported more than 10,000 positive COVID-19 cases every day. The state has now reported more than 360,000 COVID-19 cases and over 5,000 deaths. U.S. breaks another record with over 75,000 positive cases in one day The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States is continuing to surge with a record number of daily cases reported in just 24 hours. On July 17, there were at least 75,000 positive COVID-19 tests reported in 24 hours according to the New York Times. While deaths related to COVID-19 initially remained flat even as cases climbed, the United States is now seeing a steady rise in deaths. Three states have hit records for deaths in a single day. Florida, South Carolina, and Texas have each announced a record-high number of deaths tied to COVID-19. In total, more than 4,900 people have died in Florida, more than 3,700 people have died in Texas, and more than 1,000 people have died in South Carolina due to COVID-19. Texas hospitals and funeral homes are so overwhelmed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is sending an additional 14 refrigerated trucks after hospital morgues started to fill up, according to CNBC. FEMA had already sent eight trucks to the state. White House tells hospitals to bypass CDC when sending COVID-19 data The White House is telling hospitals to send important data on COVID-19 cases and deaths directly to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), bypassing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The HHS oversees the CDC. The CDC has been collecting data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths since the outbreak began. Infectious disease experts told NPR they\u2019re concerned that the agency is being ignored and politicized during the pandemic. The CDC has long-standing relationships with hospitals nationwide and collects data from hospitals and state governments about a variety of infectious diseases including foodborne outbreaks and seasonal flu. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard not to see this as some kind of interference or snub [to] the CDC,\u201d University of Arizona epidemiologist Saskia Popescu told NPR. \u201cWith so many concerns over the politicization of data right now, this is concerning.\u201d Oklahoma governor tests positive for COVID-19 Governor Kevin Stitt announced yesterday that he has developed COVID-19.

Getty Images Remdesivir shortage in COVID-19 hotspots Health officials are reporting a shortage of the medication remdesivir in areas where COVID-19 is surging. The federal government is overseeing the distribution of the medication, originally developed to treat people for Ebola. However, according to CNN, physicians in areas hit the hardest by COVID-19 are reporting they don\u2019t have enough of the drug. In Texas, one hospital reported it had enough remdesivir for just 53 patients despite having admitted over 250 patients since mid-June. Remdesivir, however, isn\u2019t a highly effective drug against COVID-19. In early studies, experts found that it may decrease hospital stays by about 4 days. California starts to shut down again amid rising COVID-19 cases Governor Gavin Newsom is now mandating a statewide shut down of indoor dining, places of worship, bars, and other establishments where COVID-19 could transmit easily. The new shut down comes as the state has seen a surge of COVID-19 cases with over 9,000 cases in a single day (July 7). In a press conference, Newsom said officials are worried that rural counties are running out of hospital beds. \u201cThis virus is not going away any time soon,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon all of us to recognize soberly that COVID-19 is not going away any time soon, until there is a vaccine and/or an effective therapy.\u201d Tweet Share on Pinterest State officials are fighting a surge in COVID-19 cases.

Getty Images Study finds about half of people have signs of heart abnormality after developing COVID-19 A new study found that over half of people who had survived COVID-19 had signs of cardiac abnormalities. Published in the European Heart Journal, researchers looked at data from 1,261 people who had been treated for COVID-19. The research subjects were between ages 52 and 71. About 70 percent of the patients were men. The researchers found that slightly more than half of the total patients \u2014 or 667 people \u2014 had an abnormal echocardiogram. Among people who didn\u2019t previously have heart disease, about 46 percent had an abnormal echocardiogram. The abnormalities seen included issues with the left and right ventricles of the heart and inflammation of the heart muscle. About 15 percent of those studied had severe cardiac disease, including fluid around the heart muscle that can impact its ability to function. Woman who was first in US to get experimental COVID-19 vaccine says she feels fantastic The first person in the United States to get an experimental COVID-19 vaccine says she hasn\u2019t had any side effects. Jennifer Haller, 43, told KOMO News in Seattle that in the months since she was given the experimental vaccine she feels \u201cfantastic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been 16 weeks since I had the first dose,\u201d Haller told KOMO News. \u201cI feel fantastic.\u201d The trial is run by Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, and the experimental vaccine was developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. It uses messenger RNA in the hopes of priming the immune system to develop antibodies. Haller said she\u2019s still taking precautions, since it\u2019s not clear if the experimental vaccine will provide immunity. During initial phase 1 trials, researchers look to make sure that the vaccine is safe. A phase 3 trial is expected later this year that may shed light on how effective the vaccine is. Spring lockdowns saved 370,000 lives, according to new research States that had shelter-in-place orders this spring helped save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The new data was released as the United States is seeing a record number of COVID-19 cases after shelter-in-place orders were lifted in late May and early June. But the report from Health Affairs found that those shelter-in-place orders likely saved many U.S. lives in the early months of the pandemic. According to the report, between 250,000 and 370,000 lives were saved by May 15 as a result of shelter-in-place orders. The report found that effects of physical distancing orders on COVID-19 cases and deaths were less clear.

The most recent CDC data suggests that pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized. They also have an increased risk of being placed on a ventilator, compared with women who aren\u2019t pregnant. Have 20 million Americans had the virus? Government experts estimate that more than 20 million Americans may have contracted the new coronavirus \u2014 10 times the official count. This means more people without symptoms have gotten the virus than previously thought.

Texas stops reopening amid surge in COVID-19 Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced that reopening will be paused as the state sees a major surge in COVID-19 cases. The state reported 5,500 cases in a single day this week. Over 125,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the state since the outbreak began. Texas is one of many states seeing a massive uptick in COVID-19 cases. Arizona and Florida are also seeing major rises with each state seeing record numbers of cases this week. California is also seeing a surge in cases with over 5,000 daily cases reported this week. In all, 26 states are seeing some increase in COVID-19 cases. While Abbott announced a pause in reopenings due to the disease, he said that he will not reimplement shutdowns. \u201cThe last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses,\u201d Governor Abbott said in a statement. \u201cThis temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business.

Federal funding for the sites will end June 30 even as COVID-19 cases continue to surge in the United States. Seven of the testing sites are in Texas which is seeing a spike in cases after reopening at the end of May. On June 23, state officials reported a new daily high of 5,000 cases. Federal officials said they weren\u2019t slowing down on testing and hundreds of sites will remain open. \u201cWe have expanded from the original 41 sites to over 600 in 48 states and the District of Columbia in the federal bundled payment program to pharmacies, and enabled over 1,400 additional pharmacy sites through regulatory flexibility empowering pharmacists and facilitating billing and reimbursement,\u201d Brett Giroir, the administration\u2019s testing czar, told NBC News. The other sites affected by the loss of federal funding are in Illinois, New Jersey, Colorado, and Pennsylvania.

The United States currently has the most reported number of COVID-19 cases in the world with over 2.3 million. Additionally, daily cases have begun to increase again in recent weeks as states have reopened. According to the New York Times, if these rules are finalized, Americans would be barred from entering the European Union along with people from Brazil and Russia which have the next highest levels of COVID-19 cases after the United States. Some essential travel between America and the E.U. would be allowed, according to the report. Share on Pinterest Using plasma from recovered patients appears to be safe for people battling COVID-19. Getty Images Next 2 weeks are \u2018critical\u2019 in US as cases surge, Fauci says Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director for the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, addressed the congress today to give an update in the fight against COVID-19. Fauci, speaking at a congressional panel along with other members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said that the next 2 weeks will be critical to see if deaths are likely to increase. While deaths from COVID-19 have been declining, cases of the disease have started to tick back up as states have reopened. \u201cThe next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surges we are seeing in Florida, Texas, Arizona, and other states,\u201d Fauci told the panel, according to the New York Times. As cases have risen, Fauci also said that they will be doing more testing despite President Donald Trump saying at a rally he wanted officials to slow down testing. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite. We\u2019re going to be doing more testing, not less,\u201d Fauci told Congress. Fauci pointed out that doing more testing and surveillance is critical to know where infections are occurring. Fauci also said health officials are \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that a vaccine for COVID-19 may be available next year. Although he cautioned it would need to be tested in the real world before it\u2019s fully approved. WHO reports highest 1-day increase of COVID-19 cases Six months into the COVID-19 pandemic and the virus is still surging across the globe. On Sunday, June 21, the World Health Organization reported the largest single-day increase in COVID-19 cases with over 183,000 cases reported. The center of the outbreak has shifted from Asia to Europe and now to North and South America. Tweet Brazil reported over 50,000 cases in one day, while the United States reported over 30,000 cases. While COVID-19 cases had been decreasing in the United States since a peak in May, in recent days, cases have started to increase again. As states have reopened, COVID-19 hotspots have appeared in multiple states including Arizona, Texas, and Florida. Plasma from people who survived COVID-19 is safe treatment for the disease A new study out June 18 finds that using plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 is safe for people currently battling the disease. The study published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings involved 20,000 people and found that the treatment, called convalescent plasma, appeared to be safe for people with COVID-19. The first group, about 5,000 people who received the plasma, had a mortality rate of around 12 percent in the subsequent week. In the early stages of the study, plasma was in short supply and people who received the treatment were severely ill. As plasma became more readily available, people were able to get the treatment earlier in their disease when it\u2019s more likely to be effective, and the mortality rate went down. However, it\u2019s unclear if there were other advancements happening simultaneously that could also explain that change. For the larger study, the mortality rate for people who received the plasma was under 9 percent, according to the Washington Post. Because of the way the study was conducted, it wasn\u2019t conclusively clear if the plasma helped lessen COVID-19 symptoms. There wasn\u2019t a control group of people who didn\u2019t receive treatment. \u201cYou\u2019d like to have the gold standard [of evidence] in something this important, and I feel like it always ends up here with this approach,\u201d said Jeffrey P. Henderson, an infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, told the Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s pushed into action quickly, because there\u2019s no other option, and there\u2019s a theoretical reason in the moment that it works.\u201d Researchers say more studies are needed to determine if receiving plasma helped effectively treat people with COVID-19.

Getty Images Florida, Arizona, and Texas see surge in cases amid reopenings The epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak is now shifting in the United States from the east and west coast to southern and western states including Florida, Arizona, and Texas. Texas reported an increase of 11 percent in COVID-19 cases in a single day with over 2,700 new cases reported on Wednesday. Over 93,000 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in the state and over 2,000 people have died from the disease, according to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. In Arizona, over 2,300 cases of COVID-19 were reported on Wednesday. Hospitals in the state are being put under pressure as well, with over 1,500 people hospitalized yesterday and at least 500 people in ICU beds, according to AZ Central. Florida is also seeing a spike in cases with over 2,700 cases reported on Tuesday. In Florida, over 82,000 cases have been reported with more than 3,000 deaths. At least 21 U.S. states are seeing an increase in cases, although former hotspots in New York and New Jersey are seeing their cases decline.

Getty Images FDA revokes emergency approval for a specific antibody test The FDA has revoked approval for a COVID-19 antibody test made by Chembio company. These tests were supposed to detect antibodies that would indicate a past infection of COVID-19. According to the FDA, initial data on the tests was adequate to give approval under emergency authorization. However, subsequent data on the tests found that they were not as accurate as initially thought and that they found high rates of false positives and negatives. Many antibody tests were approved under the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization earlier this year, but experts have said it\u2019s unclear how accurate these tests are. UK will use steroid to treat COVID-19 after reported benefits Health officials in the United Kingdom said they will start using a common steroid to treat people with COVID-19 after a study reportedly found the drug could help improve outcomes for patients. Researchers at Oxford University said that they\u2019ve seen benefits from using a common cheap steroid called dexamethasone to treat people with COVID-19. The team announced the findings in a statement today, but haven\u2019t yet released the findings in a published study. However, the early reports have led health officials in the U.K. to conclude that they will use the steroid to treat people with COVID-19. \u201cThis drug, dexamethasone, can now be made available across the NHS, and we\u2019ve taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak,\u201d UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, according to The Guardian. According to reports from the researchers, the drug helped reduce the mortality rate for the sickest COVID-19 patients \u2014 those on ventilators \u2014 by a third. Other patients who took the drug had their mortality rate reduced by one-fifth. FDA revokes emergency use approval for hydroxychloroquine The FDA is officially revoking emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to be used as a treatment for COVID-19. The drugs, designed originally as antimalarial medication, have been studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19. The drugs were also touted by President Donald Trump, who took hydroxychloroquine for 2 weeks, despite little evidence it could be used to prevent COVID-19. Recent studies of the drugs have found little evidence it helped people with the disease. Additionally, the drugs are known to increase risk of cardiac complications.

Getty Images Rare antibodies may help researchers develop vaccine for COVID-19 California researchers say that a rare type of antibody may help them develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Researchers from the University of California San Francisco and Stanford University are investigating neutralizing antibodies from people who have recovered from COVID-19, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Researchers say that just 5 percent of people with COVID-19 develop these antibodies. Additionally, these antibodies develop in low numbers, so researchers want to see if they can take enough of these antibodies to turn them into a serum that can be given to anyone. More research needs to be done, but researchers hope they can use these antibodies to create a vaccine that can protect against SARS-CoV-2. Protester in Kansas tests positive for COVID-19 As protests against police brutality have taken place across the country, public health experts have been concerned that the virus that causes COVID-19 could spread. This is especially true if people don\u2019t wear masks, are unable to physically distance, or if the police arrest people and put them in jail cells where they\u2019re unable to distance. Now, public health officials in Kansas are reporting that a protester has tested positive for COVID-19 after attending a march without wearing a mask. \u201cSimilar to what we would ask anyone who goes out in public right now, we are asking anyone who attended the recent protest to self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and isolate if they become sick, as well as call their healthcare provider for next steps,\u201d said Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health, Informatics Director, Sonia Jordan. While cases are increasing rapidly in certain states, it\u2019s likely that those increases are due to officials easing lockdowns and physical distancing measures. Due to the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, which can be up to 2 weeks, an outbreak of COVID-19 linked to protests is unlikely to be identified until later this month. CDC gives guidance on how to have a cookout, go to the bank safely The CDC has given new guidance about how to get back to normal activities and stay safe. In a call with reporters, CDC officials gave tips on how to safely go to the bank, have a cookout, and stay in a hotel, according to the Washington Post. The CDC recommended people only use drive up windows or ATMs for banks, for cookouts people should bring their own food and beverages and maintain physical distancing. If you\u2019re going to a hotel or motel this summer, get ready to use the stairs. The CDC is advising people to avoid the elevator unless necessary. Additionally, the CDC has advice for large gatherings. Among the recommendations, they say planners should broadcast tips on staying safe, cut down on the number of attendees to decrease the risk of viral transmission, and limit attendance to people who live in the area so the virus is unlikely to spread far if there is an outbreak.

Getty Images Formerly healthy woman in her 20s has lung transplant after contracting virus A formerly healthy woman in her 20s who developed COVID-19 underwent a successful lung transplant, according to physicians at Northwestern Medical Center. The woman, whose name hasn\u2019t been released, had been hospitalized for weeks after developing COVID-19. Doctors not only put her on a ventilator, they had to put her on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine that oxygenates her blood, essentially doing the work of her lungs. After putting her name on the organ transplant list, they had a match within 48 hours. The patient is now in stable condition and her health is improving, the physicians said. Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and director of the lung transplant program at Northwestern Medical Center, said the patient is awake and talking. \u201cYesterday, the patient smiled and told me \u2018Thank you for not giving up on me,'\u201d Bharat said via the Northwestern Medical Center Twitter. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more gratifying to hear.

Each trial is a phase 3 trial \u2014 traditionally the last phase before a medicine or vaccine can be approved for use \u2014 often involving thousands of volunteers. The three trials are being conducted by three different pharmaceutical companies each looking at a different vaccine candidate. According to CNN, the studies will start with Moderna\u2019s trial in July and then an Oxford/AstraZeneca\u2019s trial in August. Johnson & Johnson announced today that they moved up their trial to start in July. Early successes in phase 1 and phase 2 trials don\u2019t mean any of these vaccine candidates will be successful in their phase 3 trials. However, due to the number of vaccine candidates being tested, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director for the National Institutes for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Healthline this week that he\u2019s cautiously optimistic there may be a viable COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the year. \u201cHopefully by the end of this year we will develop a vaccine we can deploy,\u201d he told Healthline. \u201cWe can never guarantee that.

Published June 8 in Nature , researchers from the University of California, Berkeley looked at how six countries \u2014 China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States \u2014 responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically in the United States, the study found that lockdown measures, which occurred to some degree in nearly all states, helped stop the spread of the disease and that 60 million COVID-19 cases were likely avoided. \u201cWithout these policies employed, we would have lived through a very different April and May,\u201d Solomon Hsiang, director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of the study, told the Washington Post. He said the shutdowns and other mitigation measures were \u201csaving more lives in a shorter period of time than ever before.\u201d Another study also published June 8 found that measures taken by 11 European countries helped curb the transmission of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and likely helped stop 3.1 million deaths.

CDC reports people are misusing cleaning products during COVID-19 outbreak In a survey conducted by the CDC, at least 39 percent of respondents said they had misused cleaning supplies during the pandemic, according to STAT News. The misuse of cleaning supplies is likely among people trying to avoid contracting the virus during the pandemic. Experts say that physical distancing, wearing a mask, and regular handwashing are all key to avoid spreading the virus. In the survey of 502 people, nearly 20 percent said they had put bleach on food, 18 percent said they had used household cleaners on their skin, and 10 percent said they had misted themselves with disinfectant. Additionally, 6 percent said they had inhaled cleaners and 4 percent said they had ingested or gargled cleaners like bleach. This exposure to household cleaners led to a quarter of respondents saying they had negative health effects. Major medical journals retract studies on hydroxychloroquine as treatment for COVID-19 The Lancet medical journal has retracted a study on hydroxychloroquine that made headlines last week. Researchers, who published the study looked at more than 96,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19. The study was retracted due to data used in the study that had not been directly obtained by the researchers themselves. In their retraction letter the researchers from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston said they worked with the company Surgisphere Corporation to obtain data. After other medical experts raised concerns about the company, the researchers conducted a review of the data. However, the Surgisphere Corporation would not give the full dataset to the reviewers meaning they could not do a full independent analysis of the data leading them to retract their study. In the now-retracted study, the drug had been found not to improve people with COVID-19 and more people died after taking the drug. Additionally, the New England Journal of Medicine also reacted a study on COVID-19 and cardiovascular health since it also used data from the company. Hydroxychloroquine fails to prevent COVID-19 in a new study Unlike the studies mentioned above, a new study released today has not been retracted. The large study found that taking hydroxychloroquine wasn\u2019t effective as a prophylactic treatment against COVID-19. Researchers looked at 821 people with no symptoms of COVID-19. Over 87 percent had close contact with someone with the disease. About half of the people \u2014 414 \u2014 were given hydroxychloroquine and the other participants were given a placebo. Researchers found the infection rate among the two groups was statistically similar, meaning hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t show any ability to protect people from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19. They found side effects were more common in people taking hydroxychloroquine but there was no major reactions reported.

Getty Images Study finds plasma therapy may help people with COVID-19 A new study found that plasma from people who recovered from COVID-19 may be an effective treatment for the disease. The small study published on June 2 in The American Journal of Pathology examined 25 patients with severe or life-threatening symptoms of COVID-19. The patients were given plasma infusions from 9 donors who had already recovered from the illness. The primary goal of the study was to see if plasma transfusions were safe. The researchers found no adverse events from the transfusion in 24 hours after it was administered. Additionally, the researchers reported that 19 of the 25 patients improved after being given the plasma infusions. Three deteriorated and one patient died from causes unrelated to plasma infusion. \u201cWhile physician scientists around the world scrambled to test new drugs and treatments against COVID-19, convalescent serum therapy emerged as potentially one of the most promising strategies,\u201d Dr. James M.

The study published in the medical journal The Lancet found people with advanced cancer were nearly 5 times as likely to die after contracting COVID-19 than people without cancer, according to CNN. Even for people whose cancer was relatively stable had double the risk of death if they contracted the disease. \u201cThe death rate for this group of patients as a whole was 13 [percent] more than twice that reported for all patients with COVID-19\u2026 Certain subgroups, such as patients with active (measurable) cancer and those with an impaired performance status, fared much, much worse,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Warner, MS, associate professor of medicine and biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University, the study\u2019s corresponding author in a statement. However, the team didn\u2019t find that undergoing treatment for cancer, including chemotherapy or having surgery, impacted the risk of dying by COVID-19. They advised that these treatments shouldn\u2019t be delayed due to the pandemic since it can cause worse outcomes for patients. CDC releases guidelines for going back to the office safely The CDC has released new guidelines on how to safely reopen offices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Among their recommendations, the CDC advises companies to assess the building itself to make sure it has enough ventilation to prevent the virus from recirculating. Additionally, they advise separating workspaces and desks so people can maintain 6 feet of separation at all times. They point out that staggered start times, temperature checks, and disinfecting common space areas can also cut down on risk of transmission. Even with all these safeguards, the CDC recommends all workers wear face masks to protect themselves and others from aerosolized viral particles.

Phase 1 testing is designed to look at the safety of the vaccine. The company reported that they\u2019ve seen evidence that people developed antibodies to COVID-19 and that early results show the vaccine is likely safe. However, this is just a phase 1 trial and in order for the vaccine to be approved for use, it will need to be successful in phase 2 trials that look for efficacy and phase 3 trials that look at the appropriate dosage. Additionally, another pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, said they would start to produce vaccines even before they\u2019re proven successful so that there won\u2019t be a shortage of the product if it is approved for use. The company is currently working with Oxford University and investigating an experimental vaccine that\u2019s still being tested for safety and efficacy.

Llamas may help researchers combat COVID-19 Early research finds that certain antibodies in llamas may help combat the virus that causes COVID-19. A study published this week in the journal Cell found that antibodies taken from a llama were engineered to fight the new coronavirus. These special antibodies were effective in a lab setting at neutralizing the virus. The research is still in the early phases, but if successful it could mean that llama antibodies could help protect people from developing a severe case of COVID-19. Children just as likely as adults to spread virus New studies find children are just as likely as adults to spread the new coronavirus. These early findings could make potential school openings especially fraught. A German study, which is not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, looked at 60,000 people with COVID-19 in addition to 47 children with the disease. The team found that children had just as much viral load or even higher amounts of viral load than some adults. This early research focusing on how children can spread the virus could be pivotal in helping officials combat a second wave as some states weigh loosening shelter-in-place orders. Another study out of China found that school closures drastically helped lower transmission of the virus and lessen the severity of the outbreak. \u201cWhile proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40-60 percent and delay the epidemic,\u201d the authors said. Experts point out this is early research and more information is needed. \u201cAre any of these studies definitive? The answer is \u2018No, of course not,\u2019\u201d said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University.

The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner reported Tuesday, April 21, that two people who died at home in early February had the virus. The cases were identified after the medical examiner tested samples from the patients for COVID-19 due to their flu symptoms. Both of these people likely developed the disease via community spread and not from travel. The first death occurred on Feb. 6 and the second on Feb. 17. Previously, the first known U.S. death from COVID-19 was said to occur in Washington state in late February. \u201cWhat these deaths tell us is that we had community transmission probably to a significant degree far earlier than we had known and that indicates that the virus was introduced and circulating in our community far earlier than we had known,\u201d Santa Clara Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody told reporters.

Getty Images Study finds summer weather won\u2019t help stop COVID-19 A study published April 7 found that the arrival of spring and summer weather likely won\u2019t stop the spread of the virus. The study was published after a panel from the National Academies of Sciences reviewed data from around the world about the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Past pandemics such as the 1918 influenza outbreak have often waned dramatically in the summer with warmer temperatures and higher humidity helping to stop the spread of the virus, at least temporarily. However, officials say in this new report there\u2019s no sign that changes in temperature nor humidity will have a big effect on COVID-19. In part, the panel found that because the virus is new and people don\u2019t have natural immunity, they\u2019ll be more susceptible to contracting the virus throughout the year. The panel did say more research would be needed and there\u2019s a chance the viral spread may slow somewhat during the summer months even if it doesn\u2019t stop. \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity,\u201d the panel wrote, according to the Washington Post. \u201cHowever, given the lack of host immunity globally, this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread.\u201d Share on Pinterest Hospitals in New York report few beds amid growing COVID-19 outbreak.

According to the report, China \u201cintentionally\u201d reported false numbers about the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak. While the intelligence report itself hasn\u2019t been revealed, certain government officials and experts say a lack of transparency about the actual data may have impacted how countries prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak. \u201cThe medical community made \u2014 interpreted the Chinese data as: This was serious, but smaller than anyone expected,\u201d said Dr. Deborah Birx, who\u2019s coordinating the White House response to the outbreak, according to Bloomberg News. \u201cBecause I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data, now that what we see happened to Italy and see what happened to Spain,\u201d she said. This comes one day after China reported that an additional 1,500 asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 hadn\u2019t been counted in national totals. Not sure if you have COVID-19 or the flu? Know the symptoms No, the new coronavirus is not the flu. In fact, it can present very differently from that seasonal virus. We spoke to experts about how you can identify the different symptoms for COVID-19, the flu, and spring allergies. Virus shedding is high early in illness, study finds A study examined 9 people with SARS-CoV-2. The researchers wanted to understand virus shedding (when the virus leaves its host) during illness to determine how infectious the disease may be. Conducted by German researchers, though not yet peer-reviewed, the findings suggest that viral shedding occurred in high levels from the throat during early phases of illness for the patients studied. However, the rate of shedding dropped after the fifth day in all patients except for two experiencing signs of pneumonia. They continued to shed COVID-19 at high levels until the 10th or 11th day, according to researchers. \u201cThe present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool,\u201d the study authors wrote. Scientists also found that people with COVID-19 may shed over 1,000 times more virus than emitted during peak shedding of the 2003 SARS infection. They say this could explain why COVID-19 has spread so rapidly. You touch your face 16 times an hour Public health experts have advised people to stop touching their faces to cut down on the risk of contracting the new coronavirus. But that\u2019s easier said than done. We talked to experts who told us how we can train ourselves to avoid touching our face constantly. More information can be found here.

Getty Images How to stock your medicine cabinet As the outbreak continues to spread, there are ways you can prepare. Among them is simply stocking up your medicine cabinet with over-the-counter cold and flu medications. While they can\u2019t cure the virus, they can help relieve symptoms of mild cases. Research finds new ways the virus can spread Researchers are studying how people with the virus shed it and what impact it\u2019s having on affected populations. Testing and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 is currently carried out by oral swabs. But research published Feb. 17 in Emerging Microbes & Infections finds evidence that there\u2019s an oral-fecal transmission route. The scientists reported that viruses\u2019 genetic material can be detected in both anal swabs and blood samples. Crucially, evidence of the new coronavirus was found in anal swabs and blood \u2014 even when it wasn\u2019t detected using oral swabs. According to the study, this was particularly true for those patients receiving supportive care for several days.

Experts are still investigating, but early research suggests the virus originated in bats and then was transmitted to humans via an intermediary animal. What\u2019s the intermediary animal?

                              "text": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: Why is COVID-19 so harmful to the lungs? Are smokers more at risk of the virus causing damage? As a smoker, should I be taking more precautions than the average person? ANSWER: COVID-19 can significantly affect the lungs. People whose lung health is affected by factors such as lung disease or smoking tend to be at higher risk for more severe symptoms from COVID-19. You can reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 by practicing infection prevention techniques and carefully following other guidelines for slowing the spread of the illness. COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness that is caused by a virus. It can trigger symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Symptoms range widely, from very mild to severe. For those whose symptoms are more severe, the illness often leads to pneumonia \u2014 an infection that inflames the air sacs in the lungs. Pneumonia may require hospitalization and use of a breathing machine, or ventilator. In some cases, breathing difficulty coupled with pneumonia makes COVID-19 life-threatening. Poor lung health appears to play a role in deaths related to COVID-19. Although smoking isn't the only factor that influences lung health, it does have a considerable effect. Researchers believe that smoking makes people more susceptible to the infection that causes COVID-19 and its complications because smoking damages the body's natural defenses against some bacteria and viruses. Data from China show the fatality rate from COVID-19 in that country overall stands at slightly above 2%. For people who had lung disease prior to the infection, that rate is much higher at 6%. Other underlying medical conditions make a difference, too. For people with cardiovascular disease who developed COVID-19 in China, the fatality rate was more than 10%. For those with diabetes, it was 7%, and in people who had high blood pressure, 6%. In addition, the older people were, the higher their risk of severe illness. So the fact that you're a smoker increases your risk of developing more severe symptoms if you contract COVID-19. But other factors also play a role in that risk, including your age and any underlying health concerns. Whether you smoke or not, there are concrete steps that you can take to protect yourself from the virus. Always cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue or the crook of your arm, and then wash your hands. Don't touch your face until you've washed your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. Wash your hands frequently. If you don't have soap and water, use a hand sanitizer that's at least 60% alcohol. Stay home if you're sick, and insist that others in your household do the same. Reduce face-to-face interaction with anyone who might be ill. Disinfect common surfaces regularly. It's also important to get your annual flu vaccine and check whether you have received pneumococcal vaccine. Because COVID-19 and influenza have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to differentiate between the two. When you get a flu vaccine, you greatly decrease your risk of being infected with the flu. If you develop COVID-19 symptoms, that makes it easier for your care team to determine the source of those symptoms. Finally, follow the guidelines in your area for social distancing \u2014 putting space between yourself and others to reduce the spread of illness \u2014 such as avoiding large gatherings and keeping contact with others in public spaces to a minimum. Preventing COVID-19 is crucial because no antiviral medications or vaccines are available for this illness at this time. Instead, treatment focuses on controlling symptoms. Any claims that a medication, herbal supplement or other substance can effectively treat or cure COVID-19 are bogus. As you consider ways to stay healthy, keep in mind that the COVID-19 pandemic is changing quickly. Stay informed and get your information from reliable sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and Mayo Clinic. \u2014 Dr. Gregory Poland, Vaccine Research Group, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota _______________________________________________ Check the CDC website for additional updates on COVID-19.

                              "text": "In the US, a slow and confused rollout of coronavirus testing helped the new virus get a foothold and cause what is now a raging outbreak. But drug and biotech companies have been searching for a cure since January, when the severity of the epidemic in China became evident. Among the most promising candidates are antibody drugs, a type that already accounts for most of the top-selling medicines in the US. The goal of the companies looking into antibodies\u2014which include AbCellera, Berkeley Lights, GenScript, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and VIR Biotechnology\u2014is to turn one person\u2019s solution to covid-19 into a drug that can benefit everyone. Antibodies can lock onto the virus and neutralize it. A dose given to the sickest patients could beat back the infection and lower the death rate. These drugs are not vaccines, but because antibodies last for weeks or months in a person\u2019s blood, they could also act like a temporary vaccine\u2014say, to protect health-care workers. If the right antibody can be found, manufactured, and bottled, it could be among the first treatments for covid-19. That means blood from survivors is in high demand. The Rockefeller University in New York blasted out an email in mid-March saying, \u201cHave you recovered from Coronavirus infection? If so, scientists need your help!\u201d The center offered \u201ccompensation and parking\u201d to anyone over 18. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) put out its own call days later. A view of the biomanufacturing space at Regeneron. Antibodies made in bioreactors could treat covid-19. REGENRON Some US hospitals are collecting blood from survivors so the plasma in it can be directly transfused into patients with severe cases. The use of such \u201cconvalescent serum\u201d was tried as early as January as an emergency treatment in China, with promising results. That\u2019s not an ideal solution because serum, which has a large mixture of antibodies present in small amounts, is not as potent as a manufactured drug, and blood donations remain in short supply. Direct transfusions are \u201cnot scalable\u201d as an answer to covid-19, says Rockefeller University immunologist Michel Nussenzweig. Still, the blood from patients who beat the virus is invaluable in the search for specific, powerful antibodies that can be identified and manufactured in a concentrated form so that \u201cwe can give them to other people \u2026 to a lot of people,\u201d he says. Despite the promise of antibody drugs, they may not yield a cure soon. Biotech companies say they will have antibody treatments ready for testing within two to four months, and possibly in larger quantities within half a year. That means none of the custom-designed drugs will arrive in time for the first wave of the pandemic, and they may not even be available in large amounts for the next phase, which in the Northern Hemisphere could happen next fall. Says Nussenzweig, \u201cThe time line is similar to vaccines: it will take about year.\u201d Vaccines, pills, or antibodies Antibody drugs are just one of the approaches being tried. Since the start of the covid-19 outbreak, drug researchers across the world have scrambled to find a treatment. Some have thrown open their libraries of chemicals; other have fired up deep-learning programs to predict what drugs could work. Immediately, doctors in China tried existing drugs, from herbal remedies to HIV medications. By mid-March, there were more than 250 clinical trials under way worldwide, and the World Health Organization (WHO) had launched Solidarity, a global mega-study of four readily available drugs, including one used to treat malaria. More than 60 potential vaccines are also in development. In the face of widespread disease\u2014and a death rate that, according to some recent studies, appears to be about 10 times that associated with the flu\u2014all we have now are \u201cnon-pharmaceutical\u201d measures. Countries are locking down\u2014closing stores, airports, caf\u00e9s, everything but essential jobs. The unprecedented campaigns of physical distancing and, in some countries, tracing infected people and their contacts are aimed at reducing the germ\u2019s chance to move. But the economic price of these steps is already beyond calculation. Any medicine able to shorten the duration of symptoms, or that proves effective in saving the lives of dire covid-19 cases, could ease the toughest trade-offs. If a drug shifted the balance of hope for those who end up on ventilators in intensive care units, we could get back to our jobs while protecting the lives of the weak, elderly, and unlucky. With a treatment that cut the death rate significantly, covid-19 might be a problem, but not an economic disaster. Each major approach\u2014conventional chemical drugs, vaccines, and antibodies\u2014brings advantages and drawbacks. Pills are easy to make and easy to take, but none has yet been proved to work. Vaccines can give protection, but no one can predict when one will be available. (At a minimum it will take 12 to 18 months; 17 years since the world battled an earlier coronavirus, SARS, no licensed vaccine exists.) Antibodies, often given through an IV drip, have the disadvantage that they are complex to manufacture, but the advantage that they copy the body\u2019s own solution. Among \u201cde novo\u201d drugs\u2014those being designed specifically for this germ\u2014expect antibodies to be among the first you hear about. How antibody drugs work Inside your blood system, countless immune cells circulate, each one endowed with a unique antibody. Think of the antibodies as sensors able to identify foreign substances, like germs or cancer cells. The immense diversity of antibodies, made possible by the reshuffling of DNA inside newly born immune cells, accounts for why people can stave off many threats never seen before. If one of the B cells made in the bone marrow recognizes a germ, it will start spewing out its antibody in huge quantities. The time it takes to mount a successful immune response is often about a week. \u201cYou have the potential in your body to encode 100 billion different antibodies.\u201d AbCellera\u2019s microfluidic technology captures individual B cells from a blood sample and segregates them into micro-chambers, where they can be probed 200,000 at a time. A single experiment can determine which of those cells are making antibodies capable of most strongly attaching to the spike protein of the coronavirus, which it uses to enter human cells. The cells making the best antibodies can be removed from the device to have their DNA, the instructions for making that antibody, read. \u201cYou have the potential in your body to encode 100 billion different antibodies,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cThese cells are special because they recombine their DNA, and that\u2019s what our technology is able to sort through, to find the one that can be a therapeutic.\u201d Learning from Ebola How fast can an antibody for the coronavirus be found and start saving lives? The time line to beat, say experts, comes from Ebola, a bleeding disease caused by a virus that flared up in West Africa in December 2013. The disease was fatal about 65% of the time, so when it got into Liberia\u2019s urban slums and even reached the US and Europe with airline travelers, the US began pouring millions into potential vaccines and drug treatments. Regeneron was one of the companies tapped to develop an Ebola treatment. The company, based in Tarrytown, NY, has established a system for finding antibodies using mice genetically engineered with partly human immune systems. The mice are exposed to a pathogen \u201cover and over again,\u201d according to Christos Kyratsous, the company\u2019s vice president for research on infectious disease, so they develop very potent, and entirely human, antibodies without needing blood from a survivor. Regeneron rushed to create an Ebola antibody drug starting in late 2014, \u201cbut by the time we were done, the epidemic was waning, and we didn\u2019t get a chance to use it,\u201d says Kyratsous. It was an example of how drugs can come too late in an outbreak or fail to find a market at all. An antibody Regeneron developed for MERS, a coronavirus that can jumps from camels to humans and kills 30% of its victims, has never been tried on any patient, Kyratsous says. That disease, first spotted 10 years ago, is still so uncommon it\u2019s been impossible to carry out a study. \"People think that if you enter a treatment center, you leave in a coffin.\" Interest in the Ebola antibody would have faded too, but then Ebola flared back up in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). \u201cSo then we had the drug ready to go,\u201d says Kyratsous. In what public health experts say could be a model for how to battle covid-19, a trial was carried out involving 673 patients to compare four treatments. It was less than a year later, Kyratsous says, in August of 2019, that he received a call saying the trial was being halted. It wasn\u2019t a failure; rather, it was too much of a success. Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktail and one from the NIH (based on an antibody collected from a survivor of a 1995 outbreak) worked so well that it would be unethical not to give them to every patient. Only 34% of patients treated with the antibodies were dying. Among those who got the drug early, nine of 10 survived. The drug promised a transformative effect. It made people with frightening Ebola symptoms less likely to hide from health workers. \u201cPeople think that if you enter a treatment center, you\u2019ll leave in a coffin,\u201d Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, director of the DRC\u2019s National Institute of Biomedical Research, said in the British Medical Journal. \u201cFrom now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable \u2026 We have a great message: a treatment center is a place where you can recover and that you leave alive.\u201d Speeding up the chase With covid-19, people want to hear that they can go back to work, and see friends and family, without putting elderly relatives at risk. A study of the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship that became an accidental corona\u00advirus laboratory, estimated the overall death rate of people with covid-19 infection to be 1.3%. For people over 70, it\u2019s five to 10 times as lethal. As Bruce Aylward, a prominent epidemiologist with the WHO, puts it, \u201cThis is one of the most serious diseases you will face in your lifetime.\u201d If the Ebola trial\u2014carried out in under a year in a war-torn country\u2014is the current record for testing an outbreak treatment, the world hopes to beat that mark now. Regeneron says it plans to pick two antibodies against the coronavirus, and the company\u2019s billionaire founder and CEO, Leonard Schleifer, told President Donald Trump on March 2 that he could have supplies ready in the summer. \u201cWe anticipate, if all goes well, 200,000 doses per month can come out of our factory in New York, starting in August,\u201d he said. By that point an estimated 60,000 Americans could be dead from covid-19 even with strict social distancing measures in every state, according to projections from the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in April. There is intense pressure to accelerate the drugs\u2019 development\u2014to take corners at high speed, if not cut them altogether. But some experts say it\u2019s not necessary to skip steps, something that could doom a drug later on. Instead, Ebola showed it\u2019s partly a matter of spending 10 times the money to go twice as fast. \u201cYou don\u2019t throw out the rules, but you shorten all the steps,\u201d says Myron Levine, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Maryland, who has trained teams in Africa to run vaccine trials. \u201cAn accordion when extended is quite wide, but you push it together and it\u2019s short. You don\u2019t skip steps; you squeeze the accordion.\u201d As covid-19 has spread outward from China, desperate hopes have surrounded any treatment with even a chance of working. From his Twitter account, Trump touted malaria drugs based on the chemical chloroquine, even though the benefits of these are not proven, and the US took steps to make the pills widely available. A microfluidic chip from Berkeley Lights can isolate immune system B-cells and test their antibodies. BERKELEY LIGHTS Covid-19 patients have also made pleas for drugs from their ICU beds, sometimes using social media to try to contact companies. One drug they are asking for is remdesivir, an experimental virus blocker made by Gilead Sciences that is also in clinical trials. After handing out hundreds of doses to severely ill patients on a \u201ccompassionate\u201d basis, Gilead had to temporarily stop, citing \u201coverwhelming demand.\u201d Yet remdesivir was a flop in the big Ebola study. And that shows you can\u2019t tell what drugs actually work without doing a randomized controlled trial, as Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has repeatedly said during White House briefings. That type of trial involves picking some people at random to either get a drug or not get it, and seeing if there turns out to be a difference. That kind of data should be ready soonest for the available chemical pills, chloroquine and remdesivir, which are already being given to patients in organized studies involving thousands of patients. The large number of covid-19 cases means these studies could fill up quickly\u2014and solid proof the drugs work, or don\u2019t, could be in hand by summer. One possible outcome, though, is that these pills will turn out to help only a little, falling well short of a cure. In that case we may need to wait for a vaccine or for purpose-built drugs, like antibodies or custom virus-blocking chemicals of the sort that ended up being able to stop AIDS. Manufacturing project If the pandemic continues to grow, anyone who discovers a new treatment will be hard pressed to make enough of it. That\u2019s especially true for antibodies. During the Ebola trial, each subject got doses as high as 150 milligrams per kilo of body weight\u2014or about 10 grams in all. If a covid-19 antibody is created, millions of people could need it. That means antibodies would need to be manufactured literally by the ton, in a process that involves skimming the molecules from tanks of living cells and drying them into a powder. But the biomanufacturing industry has never been asked to create that much of anything. If there\u2019s an antibody Manhattan Project, it would be to build factories big enough for the job. The largest biomanufacturing facilities in the world cost $1 billion to set up and have as much as 150,000 liters of broths bubbling at once. Carnley Norman, a vice president of manufacturing at KBI Biopharma, which produces antibodies, estimates that one such megafactory might be able to make enough antibody for a million people each year. But what if we needed to treat 10 or 100 million\u2014and what if high doses of several different antibodies were required? At the high end, Norman\u2019s calculation then becomes staggering: we\u2019d need more than 300 such plants, more than exist in the world today. \u201cIf the pandemic goes completely unchecked, we are going to have a problem,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cIf an antibody becomes the only way, we would have to do something very remarkable to treat hundreds of millions. There is a question about whether manufacturing scale-up can keep up with the outbreak.\u201d Quantities of a curative antibody might be severely restricted, leading to difficult decisions about who gets treated, and in what country. Doctors and drug companies\u2014and governments\u2014would have to decide. The sickest patients will need the drugs most, but antibodies work even better if given early on. Giving them prophylactically to health-care workers will be tempting too, especially if supplies are limited. According to Regeneron, just a tenth as much is needed to protect someone for a few weeks as to treat a very sick patient. But all that\u2019s only if we get a drug. And some believe the path to an antibody, like the path to a vaccine, is probably going to be difficult. \u201cWe have to worry about the efficacy and the safety, because this virus has unique features,\u201d says Liusong Yin, who heads discovery of biological drugs at GenScript, a Chinese research company that has 50 people doing antibody screening. He says if the virus mutates, stopping it will demand more complex antibody cocktails that hit it in three or four places at once. And for severe cases, he worries, antibodies can sometimes make people sicker by contributing to a storm of immune activity. Given such concerns, some voices are rising to say that science\u2014and, by extension, clever biotechnology firms\u2014should not make excessively optimistic claims. The trouble is that the virus isn\u2019t well understood. Basic facts about it remain unstudied, including who is most vulnerable and why. Yet companies are pushing forward, which means biotechnology is being built on a foundation of scientific unknowns. In an editorial, Holden Thorp, editor of the journal Science, compared the undertaking to \u201cfixing a plane that\u2019s flying while its blueprints are still being drawn.\u201d He knows that the efforts could fail: \u201cI am worried,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat science may end up overpromising on what can be delivered in response to coronavirus disease 2019.\u201d But the alternative is that the plane crashes. And few racing to find a cure are ready to accept that fate.",

People with arthritis may have concerns about their risk of developing COVID-19 due to their underlying health condition. Experts do not yet understand how COVID-19 may affect someone with arthritis relative to the general population. However, it appears that people with inflammatory or autoimmune arthritis may be at greater risk of contracting the infection, and developing more severe symptoms, than others. Keep reading to learn more about the potential effects of COVID-19 on those with certain types of arthritis. This article also covers some precautions that people can take to reduce their risk of contracting the virus. How does COVID-19 affect people with arthritis? Share on Pinterest Scientists do not yet fully understand whether COVID-19 poses additional risks to people with arthritis. Neither researchers nor doctors know the exact effects of COVID-19 on people with arthritis. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other expert bodies are still learning about the impact of the virus on people with preexisting health conditions. According to the Arthritis Foundation, people with autoimmune or inflammatory arthritis with high disease activity generally have a higher risk of infections due to reduced immune function. Regarding children with arthritis, the Arthritis Foundation suggest that factors such as arthritis type, disease activity, the involvement of organs, and the level to which their immune system is suppressed may all play a role in the risk of coronavirus infection. Some research suggests that people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk of infection because their immune system is impaired. This is typical in autoimmune conditions such as RA. Furthermore, these people may take medications \u2014 such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs \u2014 that also affect immune function. This may increase their risk of contracting the virus. The presence of other underlying conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, can further increase risk. Is COVID-19 more dangerous for people with arthritis? There is not yet enough evidence to confirm this, but it seems that people with autoimmune or inflammatory arthritis may be at higher risk of infection or severe COVID-19 symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that conditions or medications that weaken the immune system increase the risk of severe illness with COVID-19. Experts suggest that the main concerns for those with autoimmune conditions who develop COVID-19 include secondary bacterial infections and other complications that may result from the initial viral infection. In general, those who take immunosuppressive medications, such as biologics or corticosteroids, are at higher risk of a severe viral infection. People who take immunosuppressive medications and who develop flu-like symptoms should call their doctor immediately. Healthcare professionals typically do not recommend immunosuppressive treatments in those with active infections, but the risk of disease flares is also worth consideration. A person can determine whether to discontinue, taper, or maintain their medication by consulting their doctor. Those who take immunosuppressive drugs and who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 should discuss their options with their doctor. In some cases, the risk of arthritis flares may outweigh the potential benefits of stopping treatment. In either case, it is important that people do not adjust their dosage or stop taking their medication without first seeking medical advice. Symptoms to look out for Common COVID-19 symptoms, according to the WHO, include: a dry cough fatigue a fever Other symptoms may include: aches and pains breathing difficulties gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea a stuffy or runny nose shortness of breath a sore throat red or watery eyes severe headaches In most cases, the symptoms will begin within 2\u201314 days of exposure to the virus. Most people will experience only mild symptoms, though some will have more severe ones. Some individuals may be asymptomatic. This means that they have the illness but do not display any symptoms. It is important to note that those who are asymptomatic can still transmit the virus to others. Extra care and precautions The CDC explain that the virus SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 spreads very easily and efficiently between people. To reduce the risk of contracting the virus, people should: Wash the hands regularly with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. Maintain a physical distance of 6 feet (2 meters) from other people, especially those who are unwell. Limit the time outside of the home, including in grocery stores and on the streets. When it is necessary to leave the home, try to wear a face mask. Stock up on food, medications, and other essential items to reduce the number of trips outside of the home. Disinfect surfaces and everyday household items frequently. Examples include faucets, door handles, toilet handles, keys, and remote controls. Avoid sharing utensils, towels, and other personal items with other people. Isolate sick members of the household in a separate bedroom and bathroom (if possible) until their symptoms resolve. These people should wear a face covering such as a mask when using shared spaces. Avoid all nonessential air and sea travel and other forms of public transport. Discuss the use of arthritis medications with a doctor to see if it is advisable to continue with the treatment. Anyone who believes that they have had contact with someone with COVID-9 should: monitor their symptoms closely and check their temperature daily call their doctor immediately if any symptoms develop seek immediate medical attention if severe symptoms, such as breathing difficulties, occur call ahead before going to any healthcare facility Treatment and symptom management There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms in those who contract the virus. Options include: cough medicines fluids pain-relieving medications rest Clinical trials and vaccine development studies are in progress at many medical centers around the world. People who get severely ill typically require hospitalization. In the hospital, medical staff may use oxygen therapy or ventilators, or they may use other specialist treatments to alleviate the symptoms and prevent or manage complications. Those with arthritis who contract COVID-19 should discuss their arthritis treatment with their doctor. The doctor, most often a rheumatologist, may suggest continuing with the treatment, tapering it off, or temporarily stopping use. Medical professionals will advise their patients on a case-by-case basis. What to do if the test is positive A doctor will provide individual instructions to those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Typically, those who have mild symptoms can isolate and recover at home. Self-isolating prevents the spread of the virus to others. Those with severe symptoms require urgent medical attention and perhaps a hospital stay. People with underlying conditions and those who take immunosuppressive drugs may also require additional medical care. Outlook The outlook for people who contract COVID-19 varies greatly. It depends on several factors, including: the severity of the disease the person\u2019s age, sex, and ethnicity the presence of any underlying conditions the use of any immunosuppressive treatments Current research indicates that around 80% of individuals experience mild-to-moderate symptoms, 13.8% develop severe disease, and 6.1% become critical and require intensive care. Prompt medical treatment may improve the outlook and reduce the risk of complications. In severe cases of COVID-19, complications include pneumonia, organ failure, and death.",

We've got you covered.\" That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened. \nWhen an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link. \nUSA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day.

I did not come to England before because it was not the moment. \n\u201cI came when I thought it was the moment and the moment was there.\u201d Rooney's full-kit celebration 0:55 \nEFL Cup: Despite not having played a minute of the EFL Cup final victory over Southampton, Manchester United's Wayne Rooney donned the full kit and captain's armband to lift the trophy. February 27th 2017 a day ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/News/ \nIbrahimovic, 35, added: \u201cIf we speak about the coach (Mourinho), England, the Premier League, the club has to thank him because he called me and asked me to come here, otherwise I would not have been here. \n\u201cEven my two kids wanted to see me play at United. I had my mind somewhere else. Before, everything was coming on top of the table, then Jose called. \n\u201cI have a special relationship with him. When he called it was basically, \u2018tell me what number I should wear\u2019. \n\u201cMy mind was not here. Then my kids started to bump my head and Jose called, then I am here.\u201d 'We got our trophy back!' 0:34 \nFootball: Scenes from the Manchester United dressing rooms after their EFL Cup victory over Southampton. February 27th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/News/ \n- \u2018Feel like a lion\u2019 - \nIbrahimovic relished that he was confounding all those who thought him too old for the Premier League. \n\u201cI know I look good. I feel fresh. I feel good. I feel like an animal. I feel like a lion. I feel in good shape. I train hard.\u201d Ibrahimovic was equally bullish when asked if the only way was down if he left United, one of world football\u2019s most well-known teams. \n\u201cFor me, or the club?,\u201d he replied. \u201cI will stop on top. I will not play one game by being Ibrahimovic and for what I did before. If I don\u2019t perform, if I don\u2019t bring results, I will not play. \n\u201cI will play as long as I can bring results.\u201d \nMeanwhile Ibrahimovic\u2019s agent, Mino Raiola, offered few clues to his client\u2019s future in an interview with Talksport radio on Monday. \n\u201cI never speak about contract details with the press -- I think that\u2019s something between the player, the club and myself,\u201d he said. 'I came, that's special' 1:16 \nFootball: Zlatan talks about how special he his. February 27th 2017 a day ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/News/ \n\u201cI think we should keep it that way and just enjoy the moment and we\u2019ll see what happens next year. I don\u2019t disclude anything. Anything can happen and we will see what happens. \n\u201cWe\u2019re now concentrated on the next cup. This was a very important cup and very emotional for him, for me and for Mourinho too.\u201d Raiola said he\u2019d never any doubts about Ibrahimovic\u2019s ability to adjust to the Premier League. \n\u201cKnowing how he is and what kind of person and man he is on and off the field, he can do it anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the only player in the world who can be successful on Mars or the moon.\u201d ",

Villa have also invited Taylor\u2019s family to a match.\nEDDIE READY FOR 2019\nEddie Jones\u2019s attention to detail saw the England rugby squad change hotels on Thursday from their Pennyhill Park base to Syon House near Twickenham a day earlier than usual.\nThis is to prepare the squad \u2014 who face France in the Six Nations on Saturday \u2014 for hotel hopping at the World Cup in Japan in 2019.\nBut Jones\u2019s micro-management doesn\u2019t extend to the music the RFU will play after every England try. The man in charge of the playlist will be choosing English rock classics. But Jones, who wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether he approved of music to rev up the atmosphere, pronounced: \u2018They can play YMCA for all I care.\u2019\nMeanwhile, despite the England team being expected to have by far the most representatives in the Lions squad this summer, head coach Warren Gatland has chosen to attend the two other Six Nations matches this weekend.\nEddie Jones changed England's team hotel as they prepare to face France on Saturday\nSouth African football chief Danny Jordaan, who led the bid and organisation of the 2010 World Cup, has chosen not to leave his home country since the FIFA-related arrests in Zurich in May 2015.\nNevertheless, Jordaan has emerged as a candidate for African representation on the FIFA Council and says he will travel to meetings.\nTeam GB\u2019s record-breaking exploits at the Rio Olympics have hardly led to a sponsorship bonanza for the medal winners.\nOne of the few notable deals involves triathlon heroes the Brownlee brothers, who signed up with Aldi on Thursday, while swimmer Adam Peaty and hockey captain Kate Richardson-Walsh have become the faces of Quorn, replacing Mo Farah after his contract expired.",

It has happened just once in the FA Cup \u2013 Stan Mortenson in 1953 \u2013 and never previously in the League Cup. The only other was Sir Geoff Hurst in the 1966 World Cup final. \nYet it was not Gabbiadini\u2019s own personal frustration that fuelled Southampton\u2019s burning sense of injustice ; just the belief that a 41-year wait for silverware might well have ended had referee Andre Marriner \u2013 and his assistant Stuart Burt \u2013 not ruled out Gabbiadini\u2019s clearly onside \u2018goal\u2019 in the 11th minute. \n\u201cAt this level, that assistant has to get that right; he can\u2019t even see Gabbiadini,\u201d said Matthew Le Tissier, a pundit on Sky Sports. \u201cThe referee should go over and speak to him.

Fifa has introduced trials in international fixtures, while further experiments are planned during the round of friendlies next month.\nIt all represents steady progress \u2013 and Fifa president Gianni Infantino has been driving the push for change \u2013 but that will be of limited consolation to Southampton. \n\u201cWe kept the good attitude and spirit to stay in the game after going 2-0 down,\u201d said Puel. \u201cWe played since the beginning of the season every two or three days. We played to a strong and fantastic level. It\u2019s important now to continue this work, to put away this disappointment and come back in the Premier League with this strength and this quality.\u201d",

                              "text": "T o her team-mates, England netballer Helen Housby is known as the Ice Queen. \u201cI think it\u2019s because my facial expression doesn\u2019t change that much,\u201d laughs the 22-year-old. \u201cThe way I like to play is chilled and calm.\u201d It\u2019s a useful attribute in a sport so fast-paced that players leap about the court as if dodging bullets.\nHousby is currently living in Sydney, making her name \u2013 if not necessarily her fortune \u2013 as one of the first England players to earn a living in Australia\u2019s new professional Suncorp Super Netball league . The UK\u2019s first fully professional league may not be too far behind.\nIn the latest round of Sport England funding, announced last week , netball was awarded \u00a316.9m for the next four years \u2013 twice as much as tennis and athletics, and \u00a34.3m more than rugby union. That makes it the second-highest funded sport in the UK, behind cycling . It will also get an extra \u00a33m earmarked for the England team. The figures captured people\u2019s attention because netball is neither an Olympic nor a fully professional sport; played almost exclusively by women, it has regularly been dismissed as a playground pastime.\nBut this was no shock lottery win \u2013 the continued investment in netball is proof that many, including sponsors and TV broadcasters, believe it is ready to find a much larger fanbase.\nWhich is one of the reasons why, last week, when Morwenna Ferrier wrote on the Guardian site that netball was \u201cuncool\u201d, the response was as fast and furious as a wing attack scenting a charge-down. Tracey Neville, the England coach, appeared on the Today programme to talk about it; England captain Ama Agbeze took to Facebook ; and hundreds of fans defended their sport on Twitter using the hashtag #netballontherise.\n\u201cIt definitely generated a bit of noise from the community,\u201d chuckles Helen Wynn, England netball\u2019s head of programmes and partnerships \u2013 and you sense she\u2019s not entirely unhappy about that. \u201cThe game today is athletic, dynamic, energetic \u2013 we need to change the perception from the school playground sport where you stop, start, pivot.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Briton Jo Harten playing for the Sydney Giants earlier this month. Photograph: Mark Nolan/Getty Images\nIf you watched England\u2019s game against Australia on the BBC earlier this month \u2013 high scoring, with a dramatic climax and players flying at each other \u2013 you will have noticed the similarity to basketball, one of the undisputed coolest sports on the planet. But it wasn\u2019t just the sense that the accusation was unfair that riled fans. Netball has been pushing so long for better recognition of its players and skills that Ferrier\u2019s words felt like friendly fire in the battle for gender equality in sport.\nIt is a point that Ferrier, who plays the sport regularly, accepts. \u201cIt was meant to be a lighthearted piece,\u201d she says, \u201cand I think if there was more coverage of women\u2019s sport, stories like this wouldn\u2019t be jumped on as emblematic of a bigger problem.\u201d It also doesn\u2019t help that image issues are a well-known factor in creating obstacles for women to play sport. \u201cThirteen-year-old girls want to be cool, that\u2019s a fact,\u201d wrote Agbeze. \u201cSo what do you think printing in a national newspaper that the sport that they likely partake in is \u2018uncool\u2019 is doing to their confidence and self-worth?\u201d\nPerhaps both arguments, however, missed the most salient point, which is that netball \u2013 a sport that employs only 150 full-time staff nationwide \u2013 is at the sharp end of a revolution. An insatiable global demand for sporting entertainment, combined with the professionalisation of everything from women\u2019s football to rugby to cricket, is about to transform the way women\u2019s sport is viewed and played. And netball \u2013 overlooked by the International Olympic Committee and ignored by newspapers\u2019 sports pages \u2013 has shrugged its shoulders and become a model of innovation, fashioning itself a space in a crowded marketplace, without the help of any men\u2019s game on which to piggyback.\nIn terms of participation, the hugely successful Back to Netball campaign \u2013 now a regular feature at leisure facilities up and down the country \u2013 capitalised on the sport\u2019s biggest asset. Ninety-eight per cent of women in the UK have played the game, almost certainly at school, but most drop away in their teens, never to return, because team sport isn\u2019t traditionally where women hang out together.\n\u201cOur strategy is built on insight,\u201d says Wynn, \u201cand talking to women has shown us that they often feel guilty about spending time away from their families, so when they do have some time to go out, they want to socialise. We make those sessions really welcoming and accessible, and we educate our coaches so that when people walk through the door, it\u2019s not \u2018no chatting, straight on to training\u2019, but the netball is their social time.\u201d In the past six years, 750,000 women have taken part in the programme. \u201cCreating winning teams isn\u2019t as important as making sure they grow in confidence, and creating a community feel.\u201d\nThat said, league numbers have grown steadily over the past decade from 60,000 to more than 100,000 and the pace of change in the elite game has been equally remarkable. Tamsin Greenway, who won 67 England caps, retired in 2015 and now coaches the Coventry-based Wasps team, which joined the expanded Vitality Superleague this season. She can still recall the awkward conversation with her parents when she decided to give up her ambition of studying at Cambridge University.\nNetball is the ultimate social sport \u2013 150,000 people can't be wrong | Tamsin Greenway Read more\n\u201cAt the time I was getting straight As and looking at doing an English degree. But I\u2019d always wanted to play netball for England, and I remember walking into the kitchen telling them I was going to do a sports diploma instead at a university where I could play top-class netball. My dad\u2019s face just dropped.\u201d It was a big sacrifice for a life of financial insecurity: \u201cThere was no professional future in netball.\u201d\nIn 2000, Greenway played in the grand final of Netball\u2019s Super Cup in front of 50 people; the competition comprised just six teams. Even a few years ago, the received wisdom held that there was no audience for netball \u2013 men didn\u2019t grow up with it, after all \u2013 and to broadcast images of the half-empty sports halls on university campuses where games were held was considered TV kryptonite.\nNow, though, Sky broadcasts regular Superleague clashes and this year signed a new deal to include all of England\u2019s home matches . Domestic games are regularly played in front of 7,000-plus crowds, in sold-out venues from the Copper Box in London\u2019s Olympic Park to the Genting Arena in Birmingham. That England v Australia match \u2013 which Australia won by a single goal with less than two minutes on the clock \u2013 was jointly broadcast, with the BBC, to 400,000 viewers.\nBarney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports, recalls being in the US, a few years ago, as the guest of a major American broadcast channel. \u201cIt was the first night of the Major League Baseball season and the Yankees were playing,\u201d says Francis, \u201cand in the house where we were staying there were two big TV screens, one showing the Yankees game, and the other showing the college final of the women\u2019s netball. And all the execs were in one room, watching the netball. That was a real eye-opener for me. I remember thinking, here\u2019s a sport that has potential.\u201d\nFrancis believes that other minority sports can learn lessons from netball \u2013 in particular, the way it has partnered with the broadcaster to find a regular place in a crowded sporting schedule. The Monday Night Netball slot helped build a regular following, and not just among women. \u201cLast year\u2019s Superleague was actually watched by more men, who made up 54% of the audience,\u201d says Francis.\nTamsin Greenway (left) , now a coach, seen here playing for England against New Zealand in the 2015 Netball World Cup semi-final. Photograph: Steve Christo/Corbis via Getty Images\nAppealing to a male following is not, however, considered a priority \u2013 or even particularly desirable \u2013 among the netballing community. \u201cIn certain environments, mixed netball really works, in universities, for instance, or at a social level,\u201d says Wynn. \u201cBut for lots of our participants, being a female-only sport works for them and we\u2019re quite proud of the fact that netball can help girls and women get active really comfortably.\u201d\nIf that means that inclusion as an Olympic sport is off the table, so be it. England Netball\u2019s chief executive, Joanna Adams, has pointed out how rare it is to have a sport where women can irrefutably claim to be the best players in the world, and it also makes for a unique spectator experience \u2013 the lack of swearing and family atmosphere is common to every game, where 80% of the stands are filled with women and girls.\nPerhaps the best glimpse of netball\u2019s future in the UK lies in Australia, where Housby and her England team-mate Jo Harten faced off against each other in a riproaring opener to the new national domestic competition on Saturday. The local derby between Sydney Giants and NSW Swifts was played to a packed arena at the Sydney Olympic Park and broadcast primetime on free-to-air television. The advertising hoardings were crammed with big-name sponsors \u2013 Samsung, Telstra, Nissan.\nHousby and her shooting partner, Sam Wallace, held their nerve against the heavily favoured Giants, matching them goal for goal before losing narrowly. Wallace, who hails from Trinidad and Tobago and played for Hertfordshire Mavericks in the Vitality Superleague last season, is an extraordinary athlete \u2013 powerfully shoulder-checking her opponents, and sending the ball through the net with an almost nonchalant flick of her wrist. Powerful, fast and deadly, she is a readymade superstar of the sport.\nHousby herself has already been taken aback by autograph-hunters, as she sat in the stands at a men\u2019s basketball game. \u201cThe professionalism out here is quite different,\u201d she says. \u201cThe demand for netball is incredible.\u201d Australia\u2019s outdoor culture means the game is more visible and accessible \u2013 the facilities are such that a local town might have 50 courts \u2013 and the newspapers regularly report on the games and the teams, from player ratings to controversial selections.\nGreenway says she is frustrated by the way netball is covered in the UK. \u201cWe get plenty of support at international matches, but nobody\u2019s writing about them,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a fair point \u2013 when England beat Australia in a series for the first time ever last year, only one newspaper carried the story. \u201cWe\u2019ll do magazines about our players \u2013 here\u2019s a woman who trains full time and works in a lab! But how about we talk about the sport properly?\u201d\nFerrier\u2019s remarks, and the furore they caused, are, of course, great examples of this, but as she says: \u201cWe don\u2019t play sport to be cool; we play because it\u2019s fun, good for us, and because it\u2019s a communal activity. Netball is fun, competitive, sometimes aggressive \u2026 it can be uncool but still worthwhile, and enjoyable.\u201d There will be plenty of people who watch Wallace, and the Ice Queen Housby, and the tattooed Harten, who disagree with her judgment. Either way, pretty soon we may all be talking about the game.\nSport Women Sport England features ",

How things can change. Even after 120 minutes of football at Libreville's Stade d'Angondje, the two sides could not be separated. Follow @cnnsport It all came down to penalties, thrusting Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary into the spotlight once more. Over two decades on from his international debut, the 44-year-old has a record four AFCON titles to his name, and had not conceded at the Cup of Nations for over seven years. Egypt \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec is into the final! 44-year-old El-Hadary saves Burkina Faso's \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddeb final two penalties to send the Pharaohs through! #AFCON2017 pic.twitter.com/UYn8agvcFA \n\u2014 CNN Football (@CNNFC) February 1, 2017 Read More Few days will be more memorable than this. The shootout had looked to be heading Burkina Faso's way when El-Hadary's opposite number Herve Koffi, 24 years his junior, made a sprawling save from Hamed El Said's opening penalty. But El-Hadary has never rushed things. And, when Koffi himself stepped up to take the Stallions' fourth spotkick with the final just two strikes away, his effort was dramatically beaten away by the veteran keeper. Parity in the shootout was restored, but El-Hadary was not yet done. When Amr Warda converted Egypt's fifth penalty, the Pharaohs edged 4-3 ahead. El-Hadary had beaten Burkina Faso in the semifinal way back in 1998 en-route to lifting the trophy, and had a chance to send Egypt to African football's showpiece once more. As ever, he didn't disappoint, saving the decisive effort from Chelsea loanee Bertrand Traor\u00e9, a man less than half his age. The 'seven-year clean sheet' The Pharaohs progress to a final against Ghana or Cameroon, but it was Burkina Faso that started the game more brightly. You certainly might have noticed Egypt's opponents had enjoyed a day more rest, as the Stallions arrived first to every second ball, winning much of the midfield battle. The imposing figure of Aristide Banc\u00e9 -- their matchwinner in the quarterfinals and a veteran of 19 different clubs -- was providing a consistent focal point in attack. Without star player Jonathan Pitroipa for the duration of this tournament, and Jonathan Zongo since the opening game, Burkina Faso instead relied on the clear sense of togetherness instilled by coach Paulo Duarte. But, despite four shots on target in the opening period, Burkina Faso failed to truly test El-Hadary. 30' - Egypt's \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec 44-year-old goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary has now gone more than 10 hours without conceding a goal in #AFCON competition! pic.twitter.com/y85flZYqOX \n\u2014 CNN Football (@CNNFC) February 1, 2017 And, as is so often the case, the dominant side's profligacy was eventually punished. It had been a quiet first half for Egypt's star man, but Mohammad Salah came to the fore when it counted, guiding a measured strike beyond Koffi into the top corner just after the hour. It was the first real glimpse of the Pharaohs' pedigree, but a single goal wasn't to be enough after three consecutive 1-0 wins this tournament. Just eight minutes later, Banc\u00e9 further justified his inclusion in the Burkina Faso attack, controlling the ball on his chest and pivoting in one motion, before arrowing a right-footed volley beyond El-Hadary. It was the first time the veteran goalkeeper had picked the ball out of the net at the Cup of Nations since the 2010 quarterfinal against Cameroon-- a run spanning over 10 hours of football. Thanks to his penalty shootout heroics, he may well be facing the Indomitable Lions again come Sunday. Sport meets politics The win will be particularly significant for Egypt given the Pharaohs are playing their first AFCON since 2011's Arab Spring swept across the Middle East and North Africa. On-pitch travails have coincided with political turmoil off it. Having won the tournament for a third time in succession in 2010, Egypt finished bottom of its qualifying group just a year later -- below the likes of Niger and Sierra Leone. The 2012 Port Said stadium riots and 2013's military coup then led to the 2011-12 and 2012-13 domestic seasons both being canceled. And, while some members of the Egypt squad played abroad, most of the squad faced a dearth of competitive fixtures. Such a shortage of match practice saw Egypt crash out in qualifying to the Central African Republic in 2013 and lose four out of six qualification matches in 2015. But it seems this year things are different. \"The biggest challenge is to show Africa that Egypt is back again,\" Egypt fullback Ahmed Elmohamady told CNN while training in Gabon. \"We are there to win the cup, not to just to play and go back to Egypt.\" Thanks to El-Hadary, they look set to do just that.",

You do not have access to view this Atom. \nNearly 850 new homes, comprising studio, one, two, three and four-bedroom houses, will be built with 18 buildings in total sitting on the site - ranging in height from three to 13-storeys. \nAs well as new homes, the site will also have shops, a library and cycle routes while West Ham's rich history in the area will be commemorated with a 'legacy route', which will include sculptures of legendary football figures.

It's become this quite painful, drawn-out debate that is questioning on a global scale the validity of LGBTQ+ lives,\" Liz Ward, director of programmes at LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall, told CNN Sport.\n\nIn a joint statement, the seven European federations said they asked their captains not to wear the \"OneLove\" armband as they couldn't \"put players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions including bookings.\"\n\nThat stance was reinforced by Jakob Jensen, CEO of the Danish FA, who told CNN Connect the World this week that it's \"not the responsibility of the players to discuss human rights in Qatar, or to discuss the decisions of FIFA.\"\n\n\"These fantastic football players in our team, they've been dreaming of the World Cup since they were little boys,\" Jensen said.\n\n\"We do not want to take them off the pitch. We want the matches to be won on the pitch, not behind a desk. So that's why we chose to do this.\"\n\nIf players receive two yellow cards in two different matches, they are automatically suspended from their next match at the World Cup, while two yellow cards in the same match would see them sent off.\n\nBut some former players believe it would have been a risk worth taking.\n\n\"That would have been a great statement,\" said former Republic of Ireland midfielder Roy Keane, speaking as a pundit on ITV.\n\n\"Do it for the first game, if you get your yellow card, what a message that would have been from Kane or [Wales captain Gareth] Bale.\n\n\"Take your medicine, and then the next game you move on. You don't wear it because obviously you don't want to be getting suspended. I think it was a big mistake.\"\n\nJosh Cavallo, the only openly gay top-flight male soccer player in the world, told CNN that he felt \"excluded\" by the decision to sanction players for wearing the armband, while others have questioned how much impact the gesture might have in Qatar, a country where sex between men is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison.\n\n\"Conversations I've had with people from the LGBTQi+ community have already described that messaging as vague and lacking in a real statement in what it's actually trying to achieve,\" Australian midfielder Jackson Irvine told reporters.\n\nOne campaign group agrees.\n\n\"The 'OneLove' armband was nothing more than a token gesture,\" Khya Gott, a representative for Pride in Football, told CNN Sport.\n\n\"It didn't make the dramatic statements they wanted it to. Gestures from players are important, and very much needed, but only if they're done correctly.\"\n\nGott also noted that the \"OneLove\" campaign isn't just about LGBTQ rights, but ending discrimination in all its guises.\n\nThat was made clear in a September press release from the English Football Association, which said the campaign uses the power of football to \"promote inclusion and send a message against discrimination of any kind as the eyes of the world fall on the global game.\"\n\nTeam captains wore the \"OneLove\" armband during UEFA Nations League games several months before the start of the World Cup, but it was only on Monday that FIFA announced the possibility of sanctions for players wearing the armband in Qatar.\n\nIt hasn't wholly deterred some players from trying to express their feelings about the \"OneLove\" controversy in other ways.\n\nGermany's players briefly covered their mouths with their hands ahead of their game against Japan, signaling that FIFA had prevented them from using their voices to speak up about certain issues at the World Cup.\n\nThe Danish FA feels similarly aggrieved by the situation.\n\n\"We're trying to press FIFA on this,\" said Jensen. \"We wrote to FIFA on September 19 [about wearing the 'OneLove' armband]. We got an answer on the very day that England was playing its match.\n\n\"I find that very dissatisfactory ... We're still pushing, but we did our best before the matches and FIFA were very late.\"\n\nCNN has previously contacted FIFA regarding criticism about its response to the \"OneLove\" campaign but did not receive a response.\n\nPrior to countries announcing their captains would not wear the armband in Qatar, FIFA had brought forward its own \"No Discrimination\" campaign and said all 32 captains would have the opportunity to wear an armband linked to the campaign.\n\nThe \"OneLove\" armband is not the only instance of attire being scrutinized at the World Cup. American journalist Grant Wahl and former Wales captain Laura McAllister both said they were told to remove clothing with rainbow-colored patterns -- a symbol of LGBTQ rights.\n\nWahl said he was released 25 minutes after being detained and received apologies from a FIFA representative and a senior member of the security team at the stadium.\n\nWhen asked to clarify the dress code for fans, FIFA referred CNN to the tournament handbook, which states \"expats and tourists are free to wear the clothing of their choice, as long as it is modest and respectful to the culture.\"\n\nQatar's organizing committee, meanwhile, has previously promised to host \"an inclusive and discriminatory-free\" World Cup in the face of Western criticism regarding its anti-LGBTQ laws -- criticism Infantino, speaking generally about Qatar's human rights record, slammed as \"hypocritical\" ahead of the tournament.\n\nBut as for the \"OneLove\" armband, the broader impression among campaign groups is that football has missed an open goal when it comes to showing solidarity with the LGBTQ community.\n\nWard acknowledged that LGBTQ inclusion in the Middle East \"will absolutely not be solved with an armband,\" but added that this was an opportunity to demonstrate \"that football is a game that has changed.\"\n\n\"What does it mean in 2022,\" she asked, \"to have an opportunity to celebrate LGBT inclusion and instead sweep it under the carpet?\"\n\n\u00a9 2022 Cable News Network.

                              "text": "The Hard Working American vs. The Government Parasite By Michael Snyder, on April 10th, 2012 \nWhich lifestyle choice produces better results \u2013 being a hard working American or being a government parasite? Actually, when you look at the cold, hard numbers they may just surprise you. In America today, we deeply penalize hard work and we greatly reward government dependence. If you live in a very liberal area of the country and you know how to game the system, it is entirely possible to live a comfortable existence without ever working too much at all. In fact, there are some Americans that have been living off of \u201cgovernment benefits\u201d for decades. Many of these people actually plan their lives around doing exactly what they need to do to qualify for as many benefits as possible. America is rapidly turning into a European-style socialist welfare state and it is destroying our nation socially and financially. Ever since the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d began our debt has absolutely exploded and yet now there are more poor people in this country than ever before. Obviously something is not working. \nNow don\u2019t get me wrong. I deeply believe in having compassion for those that are going through tough times and having a safety net for those that cannot take care of themselves. We should not have a single person in this nation going without food or sleeping in the streets. \nBut in America today it is absolutely ridiculous how many people are climbing aboard the \u201csafety net\u201d. At this point, an astounding 49 percent of all Americans live in a home that receives some form of government benefits. \nSo who pays for all of this? \nThe people that drag themselves out of bed and go to work each day pay for it all. \nFor a few moments, let\u2019s examine how the lifestyle of a typical hard working American compares to the lifestyle of a government parasite. \nIn America today, the median yearly household income is somewhere around $50,000. About half of all American households make more than that and about half of all American households make less than that. When you break it down, it comes to about $4000 a month. \nSo how far does $4000 go in America today? \nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t go very far at all. \nFirst of all, a hard working American family will need some place to live. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the decent jobs are near the big cities, and it is more expensive to live near the big cities. Let\u2019s assume that an average family of four will spend about $1000 a month on rent or on a mortgage payment. \nThe government parasite, on the other hand, has a whole host of federal, state and local housing programs to take advantage of. During the recent economic downturn, more Americans than ever have been turning to the government for help with housing costs. For example, federal housing assistance outlays increased by a whopping 42 percent between 2006 and 2010. \nOnce you have a place to live, you have to provide power and heat for it. For the average hard working American, this is going to probably average about $300 a month, although this can vary greatly depending on where you live. \nFor the government parasite, there are once again a whole host of government programs to help with this. For example, LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program) assists low income households in paying their home heating bills. \nMost average hard working Americans are also going to need phone and Internet service. Let\u2019s assume that the hard working family of four in our example is extremely thrifty and only spends $100 a month for these services. \nFor the government parasite, cell phone service is not a problem. As I have written about previously , those that \u201cqualify\u201d can receive a free cell phone and free cell phone minutes every single month from the federal government. In addition, in some areas of the nation low income families can qualify for deeply subsidized home Internet service . \nIn order to earn money, our hard working family is going to need to get to work. In most households, both parents have decided to work these days so both of them will need cars. Let\u2019s assume that the family is very thrifty and that both cars were purchased used and that the car payments only total about $400 a month. \nThe hard working family will also need auto insurance for the two vehicles. Let\u2019s assume that both parents have a great driving record and that they only pay a total of about $100 a month for car insurance. \nThe cars will also need to be filled up with gasoline. The average U. S. household spent $4155 on gasoline during 2011, but let\u2019s assume that our family is very, very careful and that they only spend about $300 on gas each month. \nSo what about the government parasite? Well, the government parasite does not need to go to work, so this expense can potentially be eliminated entirely. But since most other things are paid for by the government or are deeply subsidized, in many instances government parasites are actually able to afford very nice vehicles. \nIn addition, a new bill (The Low-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act) has been introduced in Congress that would give \u201cqualifying\u201d households money to help pay for gasoline\u2026. \nLow-Income Gasoline Assistance Program Act \u2013 Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to states to establish emergency assistance programs to pay eligible households for the purchase of gasoline. \nA hard working American family is also going to need health insurance. Well, we all know how expensive health insurance has become. In fact, health insurance costs have risen by 23 percent since Barack Obama became president. But let\u2019s assume that our hard working family has somehow been able to find an amazing deal where they only pay $500 a month for health insurance for a family of four. \nFor the government parasite, health insurance is not needed. If there is an emergency, the government parasite can just go get free medical care at any emergency room. \nAnd of course there is always Medicaid. Back in 1965, only one out of every 50 Americans was on Medicaid. Today, one out of every 6 Americans is on Medicaid, and things are about to get a whole lot worse. It is being projected that Obamacare will add 16 million more Americans to the Medicaid rolls. \nSo what about food? \nEveryone has to eat, right? \nWell, the hard working family in our example is faced with an environment where food prices are constantly rising but paychecks are not keeping up. Let\u2019s assume that the hard working family in our example clips coupons and cuts corners any way that it can and only spends about $50 for each member of the family on food and supplies each week. That comes to a total of $800 a month for the entire family. \nSo what about the government parasite? \nGovernment parasites need to eat too. \nWell, that is where food stamps come in. Right now, there are more than 46 million Americans on food stamps. Since Barack Obama became president, the number of Americans on food stamps has increased by 14 million. Food stamps have become so popular that rappers are even making rap videos about using food stamp cards. \nOkay, so after all of this where do we stand? \nWell, the average hard working family so far has spent $3500 out of the $4000 that they have to spend for the month. \nWe still need to find money for clothing, for paying off credit card debt, for paying off student loan debt, for dining out, for entertainment, for medications, for pets, for hobbies, for life insurance, for vacations, for car repairs and maintenance, for child care, for gifts and for retirement savings. \nBut wait. \nThere is actually no money left at all because we have forgotten one of the biggest expenses of all. \nTaxes. \nWhen you total up all federal, state and property taxes, our average hard working family is going to pay at least $1000 a month in taxes. \nSo that puts our average hard working family in the hole every single month. \nMeanwhile, the government parasite does not pay any taxes because he or she does not earn enough money to be taxed. \nAre you starting to get the picture? \nIn many ways, life can be so much easier when you are constantly taking from the government instead of constantly giving to the government. \nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie recently put it this way \u2026. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a bunch of people sitting on a couch waiting for their next government check\u201d \nOnce again, I am not dumping on those that have been through all kinds of nightmares because of this economy. As I have written about so frequently, the U.S. economy is simply not producing enough jobs for everyone anymore, and this is creating major problems. \nJust about everyone needs a helping hand at some point, and we should always be compassionate to those that are in need. \nHowever, there is also a growing number of Americans that are content to simply give up and live off of the government, and that is fundamentally wrong. \nIt is not the job of the U.S. government to take care of you from the cradle to the grave. What the U.S. government is supposed to do is to make sure that we have a well functioning economy that operates in an environment where hard working individuals and small businesses can thrive, and sadly the U.S. government has failed miserably in that regard. \nWe desperately need the U.S. economy to be fixed, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath waiting for that to happen. \nAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance and at some point the safety net is going to break. \nWhat is our country going to look like when that happens? The Shocking Truth About Unemployment In America In One Chart \u00bb David H \nPreach it Michael! I work in the finance industry and can\u2019t tell you how many applications I see where the single mother of 1-4 kids, in some cases, from different fathers is getting child support, afdc, wic, housing assistance and has a boyfriend or ex- husband living with them and making 2-5k a month. These people live better than most others because they are working the system with no one to tell them anything different! In addition to this issue we have another large issue of people bartering or being paid in cash avoiding taxation completely. We are all going to pay dearly for our arrogance, indifference, and ignorance! Rancher \nYou know what\u2026 there are and more often times I would rather burn my cash than send it into the govt to pay these bums sitting at home. We do every darn thing we can to keep it out of those leaches grasp\u2026. Prepared Pastor \nI briefly dated a woman with three children who I saw really gaming the system. Her subsidized townhouse apartment was nicer than my own home. Her utilities were based on her income and she made great dinners using food stamps. \nShe was in her last semester of college to earn a bachelor degree when I asked her what her plans were for after college. When she told me she was going for another degree so she could stay on the dole I broke up with her. \nI imagine she has a free cell phone now. Michael \nI would say that you sure dodged a bullet there Pastor. \nMichael Joel \nIf you want to have an idea of the sress it can create for workers just look toward Belgium (Europe). It\u2019s the country with the \u201cbest\u201d welfare system. From your birth to your death you are under government umbrella. Of course this come at a price : the active workforce pay for it. \nFor instance, did you know, an immigrant can receive money from the government (as a right to live decently) even without working. Then he can bring in his family if he was alone when he arrived (under the family reunion excuses), which in turn have some right also\u2026 The amount of money they can receive is between 900 \u2013 1200euros per month\u2026 all of that at the expense of the workforce. \nBy the way, the demographic pyramid his completely reversed. At first the Belgian welfare system was build around an era of full employment (50\u2019s and 60\u2019s), when the workforce was made up of young generations (babyboomers) and when everything has to be rebuild after the war. \nNow, the babyboomers at become the papyboomers and have a right for their retirment, etc, etc. Yet this system being based on the active workforce (made up of less young people and underqualified), it is meant to crash one day or another. \nTo see the USA going toward a European version of welfare system is a huge mistake destroying the foundation of your country. \nJo\u00ebl MisterD \nUnfortunately, I believe this has passed the point beyond return. The best anyone can hope for now is a miracle or get ready for the inevitable crash. I pray that nobody nor I will be forced in the middle of the mess such as having to literally protect oneself from crazy people, etc. Ashley B. \nFinally someone that is not afraid to say something about this! It sickens me to see people leeching off the system because it\u2019s easy money and food and of course free. \nI know of LOTS of people where I live that get food stamps, SSI, welfare etc. because it\u2019s free and they don\u2019t want to work (many of them are too lazy to take the trash out, seriously) \nYet me and the rest of my family earn a living, work hard and have to look at these bums drive nice cars, sit home all day and pump out paychecks, I mean kids. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, some people honestly need help and I often donate to the needy, but these are different from the pure lazy bums that just TAKE benefits because they\u2019re too lazy to work. Jodi \nI have to say I love the \u201cpump out paychecks, I mean kids\u201d. So true! I have a friend who is a retired nurse and she has seen a lot of young people in the hospital with child who had good intensions on going to college and getting a degree. Most of them go to school, get married and get pregnant before they even graduate. Without even thinking about starting a good life and financially being prepared, they get on medicaid & welfare because they don\u2019t have the money or a job to take care of their child. Sheepdog 1 \nI guarantee that the \u201cGovernment Parasites\u201d will pay\u2026 \n\u2026come Judgement Day. \nMeaning of course, they will never pay. Recoveryless Recovery \nGreat article, as usual! \nOne of the MAIN reasons why the American sheeple haven\u2019t REVOLTED yet is precisely thanks to all the government hand-out programs that currently exist. Indeed as you well said; many, many Americans actually plan their entire lifestyles around doing whatever it takes to continuously qualify for them. Unfortunately for the rest of us, as long as there\u2019s a dumpster behind a McDonald\u2019s that these SLOBS can dive into for free food, they will NEVER go hungry. And revolutions rewquire HUNGRY people. \nCheckmate. \nToday\u2019s America offers only TWO viable expectations for achieving actual \u201chope & change you can believe in\u00ae\u201d: one requires you to wield a passport & one-way ticket overseas, the other requires wielding an AK-47. \nI myself will go with Option A. Paul \nThe fostering of dependency on illegitimate governments installed through media fraud or outright election fraud (like you have in the US) is what it is really about. DAS \nI will give you an example of the the system is flawed. My father worked full time all his life. Paid all his taxes, S.S. and so forth. When the doctors found his canser, it was to late, he had only a short time to live. He worked intill the day he fell and could not walk. We (his family) supported him with his finaces as best we could. Going to the goverment only for help with food stamps. They gave him 14 dollars a month! W.T.F. can you buy with that. We shopped at discount stores, were many people used food stamps. I watched as these people got in to nice cars, with nice clothes with BAGS full of food. Mean while I hurried back to my 12 year old truck (so i wouldent be late for work) with a small bag a crap food. I guess I need to lean how to milk the system too. R.I.P. dad mondobeyondo \n$14.00 a month? GASP! The explanation that comes to mind is, the government must have been using employment and income data from 1912, not 2012. \nThe reality is, Uncle Sam is flat broke. He has too much pride to tell you he\u2019s broke. Bernadette \nThat is just sick, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. That is so ridiculous I don\u2019t even know what to say. GOD bless your poor dad, and you for having to go through that. I\u2019m so sorry:( Jodi \nIt\u2019s true, I\u2019ve known some people in my life that do as little at possible to get government assistance. Most of them seem very proud of it and believe they deserve it. My question is, what happens when government runs out of money and can\u2019t pay all these people who have been dependent for so long? That doesn\u2019t sound good! Nothing to see here, go back to sleep. Ron \nThink Greece WM \nJodi, Don\u2019t go back to sleep when the money runs out. It is inevitable that the borrowed money will stop coming and all therse free loaders who have no clue of what it\u2019s like to actually do something, will riot, protest, and burn the cities of America down. Consider this future event as a time of national cleansing, because the millions and millions of law abiding citizens who enjoy the 2nd Ammendment,and have worked for what they have, will surely bear arms to protect themselves from the entitlement zombies coming to take what they have\u2026 \nThere will be a population decrease and a cleansing of the entitlement crowd. \nBut, please do not sleep. This is a time to prepare and keep watch, things are going to get very interesting in this nation in the very near future. Jodi \nI will never go to sleep. It seems like the media ignores this stuff and treats people like it\u2019s time to go back to sleep. That is what I meant! 007 \nHave you ever watched a zombie movie. It will be a lot like that when the government checks stop. James \nThe poor and unemployed in the U.S. will never be able to get off of the government roles. We are experiencing what I like to call, \u201cReverse Industrial Revolution\u201d. The Industrial Revolution was a time when farmers were attracted to the big cities for jobs that paid high wages, when compared to their farm incomes. Now, we are experiencing high unemployment from jobs that will never come back unless the energy situation is somehow reversed. These unemployed people will soon realize that they have to have someway to get food to feed themselves. Especially if food stamps and government assistance starts to disappear, and it will. These unemployed people should begin to relocate out into rural areas to find homes where they can grow and produce their food, and sell the rest for income. There is a situation starting to appear in this country where going to college is not a good investment anymore. The only real need for college nowadays is for medicine, engineering, and law. You would be better off taking out a loan for a farm. or opening a small business rather than going to college. Farm and agrarian related jobs can make good money, especially if you own your business. If this reversal comes to fruition, the small rural towns will come back to life and support families and provide a reasonably good life. Tom \nThe only real need for college nowadays is for medicine, engineering, and law. \nMedicine and engineering- yes, but law? The LAST thing this country needs is another lawyer (sorry Michael)! MANY of the problems facing this country were caused but lawyers and the fear of law suits! Tom \nsorry again- by lawyers nowwthen \nGood points. If you can\u2019t find work with a useless bachelor\u2019s degree you will still be accountable for paying back your student loans even after going through bankruptcy. If, like you advise, you instead borrow money to buy a farm or start a business your hard work would benefit you and your family and not a corporation that views you as an expendable business expense. And if your business failed those loans could be reduced or eliminated through bankruptcy. Too many kids are brought up being told to study hard so they can grow up and find a good job. Parents should be telling them to study hard and learn how to run a business that involves doing what you\u2019re good at. S. Wiseman \n\u201cYou would be better off taking out a loan for a farm. or opening a small business rather than going to college. Farm and agrarian related jobs can make good money\u201d James, you are right on the money. I know many people who are doing just that \u2013 buying or leasing small acreage to grow crops (1 to 5 acres) and build cottage industries. They are sick and tired of being milk cows for the government leeches and are doing the right thing by starving the beast of what it needs. The major news networks will never report this trend but it is happening. The peaceful revolution has begun. Of course, the government may react with forced labor. Bernadette \nWow, those are really good ideas, and I agree with you on so many levels:) Why are you not running for President? We need someone at the Helm with a sharp mind, with creative ideas. Not the ideas of destruction coming from Washington. Everything you said made so much sence. Now I know what to pray about:) Cinderella Man \nAgreed going back to the basics of rural living will become a means to an end in the future. There is no hope in living in the superslum cities of tommorrow! ky survivor \nOne step closer to total control. That is what a welfare state is about. God help us. Josh \nI highly doubt that Jesus would use the term parasite to describe a fellow human being. DAS \nYour right. He would call them leaches Another Richard \nHow about \u201cvipers\u201d in Mathew 3:7? Jesus was not at all \u201cpolitically correct\u201d as we sweet Christians are Laodocian America are. Colin \n\u2026you have a better term? David H \nTrue\u2026.but he would say get off your rear end and work for your living if you are able. At least volunteer your time to some worthy cause to help justify the free lunch your on. I have a relative that draws SSDI (Social Security Disability) and volunteers he says he does it to help justify his disability payments he recieves. We need more people in the world like that. 007 \nHow about sluggardly leaches. If a man will not work let him not eat. Proverbs. Steve \nYour blog refers to those who feeding off of the nanny state. What about the millions of government(valueless)workers making 75 \u2013 150 K/year with all the perks and a rosy pension they can start to draw before they turn 60 (unless they double or triple dip). They\u2019re just as parasitic as the the free loader on the dole. Altogether, these parasites make up more than half of America\u2019s population. At this stage of the empires existence, I\u2019m saying to myself, let it all collapse. It\u2019s going to be hellish but the longer the government props up the dog poop with fiat money, the more chaotic it will be. Michael \nSteve: \nYes, you are right. I have written about the inflated compensation that government workers get in the past. \nMichael Klean \nAll systems are broken. There is no right anymore. Stop thinking there is a right way to do something. Going back to sleep is more interesting than earning a living. SpunkyBunks \nMy lazy obese sister is one of these parasites. We are all ashamed of her and she knows it. Her worthless husband doesn\u2019t even bother showing up around us anymore because he knows we think less of him as well. And they have five children, 3 of them are high school dropouts so far. Great welfare system we have in Amrica. It rewards these losers to sit around and breed more idiots too! Paul \nNice family. \nWhere have family values gone these days? \nWhy should the tax payer pay for YOUR family, if you do nothing but complain about them? \nWhat have YOU done to prevent your nieces and nephews dropping out of high school? Bernadette \nYour sister is so lucky to have such a supportive family to help her through her hard times. I\u2019ll just bet you all were that supportive of her during her whole life that\u2019s why she\u2019s been such a success. \nGood job mom and dad:D Mattyboy \nStart to hide your income. Make extra cash doing things (legal) that can be hidden. This has gone on for a long time in the EU. Taxes are close to 90% over there. I do not want to pay the Fed for a number of reasons. I wish we had a revolt of about 200 million that decided to not pay taxes. I guess we would only need 58 million. I like making cash that I do not have to claim. I would also support a flat tax and the abolition of the IRS. But, you can\u2019t trust the Gov. they always \u201cneed\u201d more money. Kathy Smith \nI totally agree MATTY I wish there was a way to get everyone to not pay taxes for 1 pay check & not buy gasoline for 1 day.That would get some attention.

I no longer manage the apartment complexes, but I have seen all that Michael writes about in the past. It make me sad to see where this country has gone. We used to be a proud nation that could do anything, but no longer is our population strong in heart. We have become a weak useless country of people that think everyone else owes them a living. tappedops \nFor the umpteenth time\u2026 dont get mad\u2013get even,\u2026 and if you cant get mad, its because youve been labotomized by the air food and the water\u2026 your programmed\u2026your under mind control\u2014 yea- laugh while you can.

I am a tax payer. I also an unemployed, but if I need some assistance you betcha I will apply. My dad, who is a Vietnam Vet, can qualify for food stamps but he say \u201cWe aren\u2019t that po\u2019!\u201d My mom wants him to get the aid. Anyway to help make ends meet should be explored.

Cinderella Man \nDude they take taxes out of unemployment checks\u2026 McKinley Morganfield \nYes, they take FICA out. But in the end isn\u2019t it really government playing a charade by simply giving them less? BTW, SS & medicare, which are supposed to be funded by FICA receipts, are both in the red. For every $1.00 DC spends, $0.40+ is borrowed money. Annual interest payments on the federal debt will soon be $500,000,000,000. Do you think this can continue another 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? Rancher \nExcuse while I barf\u2026. Rodster \nThere\u2019s a big difference.

At This Time the Democrat party is pounding the welfare drum again, they want to add more people to the welfare rolls in this state, who in the hell is going to pay for this? This state is already having money problems we do not need anymore.Since i have been told that i am confused let me relate a fact to you sharonj one reason george bush would not sign the kyoto treaty back when he was president was because of the irreversable damage it would do to the u.s economy now obama has done this in his own way and look at what has happened and mix that together with the ptb\u2019s desire to create a global economy somebody has to pay the price and it is obvious who it is. I Am Neither Democrat nor Republican as i do not care for either, old phart why don\u2019t you tell them to point the gun the other way? Some people in this country are stupid and lazy and need to get off there fat asses and quit stuffing there faces full of potato chips and get a education and a job, the truth hurts doesn\u2019t it. I Am tired of seeing more and more of my hard earned money going to deadbeats so they can live a nice easy life and not have one ounce of respect for the people that are making it happen for them. Gay Veteran \n\u201c\u2026the problem with companies leaving this country started when obama took office\u2026.\u201d \nThat is pure BS and you know it. I\u2019m no Obama fan but outsourcing did not start with him. McKinley Morganfield \nTo protect fools for the folly of their actions fills the world with fools. If you want more of something subsidize it. If you want less of something punish it. We, in the name of compassion, reward fools who have made bad choices. We subsidize those bad choices generation after generation. We punish frugality and hard work via regulations, taxes, and low interest rates. \nDemocracy is dangerous when it creates a class of citizens who benefit from the frugality and hard work of others. Robbing Peter to pay Paul only works until you run out of Peters to rob. I have compassion for those who are truly needy through no fault of their own, but leeches must be starved. Blood sucking ain\u2019t the way. mondobeyondo \nThe system seems to be geared toward rewarding the parasites. There are those out there who truly, honestly are in a hard-luck situation, and need a helping hand, so to speak. \nAnd then you have the parasites and leeches. Those who decide to make government dependence their career choice. The ladies (ahem \u2013 I use that term loosely) who are accustomed to pumping out a baby every couple of years so they can get better benefits. Food stamps, Aid to Dependent Children, WIC, child support (hope you had a \u201csugar daddy\u201d knock you up!) All coming their way in 9 months! And they didn\u2019t even have to move their bloated gluteus maximus (okay, obese donkey) off of the couch. Life is grand! \nGovernment assistance programs were not created so that these leeches can suck the lifeblood out of the hard working people. Another Richard \nGovernment assistance programs were created to make the Masses dependent upon the Gubmit. Roosevelt once said that \u201cnothing happens in Gubmit by accident\u201d. Gubmit undrestands human nature very well and how dependent humanity becomes on freebies and will cooperate with the gubmit to attack the honest hard working people who produce things and are the Real tax payers. When the producers of goods and services want the Freebies stopped by the gubmit, the leaches and parasite Masses will defend the Gubmit giveaways to the Death. Gubmit knows that. whens dinner? \nIt\u2019s a simple as this: \u201ceverybody wants to eat the corn, but nobody wants to plow the fields\u201d. Tom Lowe \nA lot of us don\u2019t mind plowing the fields! In fact we actually enjoy doing so. mondobeyondo \nI hope my federal income tax money (yes, I have to pay this year) doesn\u2019t go to helping those lazy pathetic sloths. But you know and I know that\u2019s exactly where it\u2019s going. \nNow I\u2019m starting to get angry. You won\u2019t like me when I\u2019m angry.

Just sayin\u2019\u2026. 007 \nThe most infuriating aspect of this welfare system is that it is unrealistic and unsustainable. The welfare state slowly but surely strangles the economy. The higher taxes and regulations and overbearing laws destroy the ability of businesses to survive. Inevitably, the unsustainable benefits will end just like they are ending in Greece. What will the parasites do when the freebies stop. They will starve like domesticated pets do or they will turn violent. Either way it will be a night mare similar to post apocalyptic zombie movie. It will be a pitiful life trying to avoid being eaten alive by these same parasites that are currently living off of the government tit. Tom Lowe \nI believe that is one reason why they have built \u2018Camp FEMA\u2019. 007 \nGreat article Michael. You certainly articulated the crisis which is slowly strangling the life out of the country. I read your article and feel I am able to look into the future and see how this nightmare ends.

Pat \nLet me also add that: \n1. in Europe a garbage man makes as much income as a physician. Neither can be fired for incompetence. \n2.Income taxes in some places can be as high as 70%. And they have no deductions. \n3. The government is in direct competition with business. \n4. There is very little fishing or hunting. Pollution is rife. \n5. Few if any go to university. \n6. You must register where you live. \n7. Even your name change has to be approved by the courts if you want to use a name that is not on an approved list. \n8. And most of the people live in small flats often without bath tubs. \n9. In Spain we have no kitchen. In Denmark we had no shower or tub. \n10. All protests must be approved by the government. \nWelcome to your future. \n\u2026as it is so in many sectors of the U.S. education system. \nHow many schoolteachers are fired for incompetence? Not many, I suspect. \nTeachers teach the leaders of tomorrow. Our future teachers, teach future biologists, musicians, artists, plumbers, scientists, Web page designers, doctors, veterinarians, you name it. \nFor the job they do, most teachers are highly underpaid. The athletic coaches and deans are well compensated, of course. \nMaybe it is not so important to most of you. But try having garbage workers go on strike for a month. You will soon realize how essential they are. View from Abroad \n@1) How did you like your stay in Albania? \n@2) You seem to speak of some of the Scandinavian Countries (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway)\u2026but there the vast majority, even of those who are in the top-income-tax bracket, approve of it, because they see that they have a superior education system and an overall very efficient government and even welfare system. \n@3) Yes, right \u2013 government chooses to do e.g. waste management themselves, ecologically and recyclable to the max\u2026instead leaving it to the likes of \u201cBarone Sanitation\u201d (remember your \u201cSopranos\u201d, do you?). And you really think, YOU are better off in this matter???? \n@4) In most of rural Europe there is as much fishing and hunting as in rural US. Of course maybe not so much fishing e.g. in the Thames or the Rhine \u2013 so what? Go fishing in downstream Hudson River, and see what you catch. \n@5) Surprise: quite a LOT go to university \u2013 and WITHOUT burdening themselves with student loans for the rest of their lives, because it\u2019s mostly FREE (except for some \u201cElite\u201d institutions, where the only meaning of \u201cElite\u201d is \u201cRich\u201d). \n@6) Yes. So what??? \n@7) Yes\u2026there was a couple of immigrants in Cologne (Germany) a few years ago, who wanted to name their newborn son \u201cOsama bin Laden\u201d ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,212569,00.html ) \u2013 sorry, you are right, they were wrongfully turned down by our brutal, fascist, jackbooted Civil Servants. Horrible. \n@8+9) Well, YOU get what YOU can afford, even in Europe. But I have heard rumors that somewhere in Germany and even in France there are flats with a water closet(!!!)\u2026never seen one myself, poor me old European\u2026 \n@10) Oh, yes\u2026horrible. Luckily in the US you can rally any amount of people at any time you like \u2013 to let them get tasered down by the thugs you call \u201cPolice\u201d Gary2 \nStop speaking the truth you are ruining a lot of low information foolish republican conservatives world view. \nYou are 100% correct. \nLike I said before reality has a well known liberal bias. Marcus \nThat was eastern Europe 30 years ago\u2026 In Scandinavia we\u2019re doing quite well atm. I would say there\u2019s less welfare here than in the USA by now. And I pay 30% tax. For these 30% I get healthcare as well. I live in a nice house, I have a new car, I eat good and healthy food. Almost all services are private, even the ones financed by taxes. And I\u2019n not considered rich here. I\u2019m middle class. \nIn my opinion the middle class is actually growing here. And, by the way, my country does not have any oil. \nHave you ever been to Europe? Maybe Romania then\u2026 Idiot\u2026 Gwyn \nI am so sick of hearing how wonderful is to be living on Government hand-out. One I start working at 16. At the age of 50 my health and back went. I have done manual work all my life and now I can not stand for 5 min. before I need to sit. And for all that I live on $718. a month and get $50. on food stamps. And in the winter I may get 500. for winter heat. My house is $300 a month in cold of winter. They used to give $150. for cooling in summer but that end so they could help more people with winter needs. I do not own a car, could not afford repair it if broke down. So that mean friend who I pay gas money to or a cab if shopping or bus to go doctors. Also medicaid is no wonderfulness either I am grateful for it, but I have go to a clinic and wait for a month or six weeks for appointment or go emergency ward. Also my pills can be change any time state decide that they get better deal from another company. Not if it good for me or not. I am not living in one of those towers and paying 1/3 of income. I am lucky my family left part ownership of house to me. But I have property Tax to pay and house insurence and repairs and I do not get free phone or internet,I pay for it and the taxes that go with it. I do have to pay some money to doctor and pills but not lot I agree. But living like this means you are my entertainment. I bake my own bread and clean my house from chair. Also my clothes are second hand. Goodwill have lots of visit from people now days. I get sick of this idea that poor pay no taxes. What bill do get that does not some kind of tax on it. Anyone useing those same service have to pay them as well. Are they has much as yours? no. but they all so have less. Less to have fun on less to go out on and less to buy lots food with. Live on $50 see how far that take you. The rest comes for that monthly check I so lovely dream about every month sitting on my sofa. Till you be there you have no idea what like to live it. Not the pain I live with or problem that come with living. I look forward with fear as I watch the state and Federal government talks about things they need to cut so they can give people who live fancy house more money and want to vote for man for President who has bank account in places,like that Island and country with special banking laws. Make no mistake I know that cuts are coming but I am not going easy into that goodnight, so our million dollar congress men and women can keep there golden rewards. I know neither of the parties are our friends but I also know games have been play and working people money got rip off instead of yell for their heads so offend you worry about those who have less then you do. denny \nThe article itself betrays its own horse . If families had that many liabilities every month, they wouldn\u2019t be paying very much in taxes. The 1% have that part down though as most of them don\u2019t pay near as much relative to what a $50,000 wage earner pays. It\u2019s also suspicious that this article doesn\u2019t mention corporate welfare which usually receives twice as much as the social welfare recipients do and let\u2019s not forget what all those lobbyists are for. What\u2019s a Lockeed/Martin contract except glorified corporate welfare or the blackmailing which corporations pull on municipalities when they promise to build a factory in the environs ONLY if they are exempted from paying local taxes. Nah, this article is just more of the Republican AND Democrat crap of blaming those of us who have been hit the hardest for the consequences of the war which the wealthy have laid our lives, infrastructure and jobs to waste. Surprised to find it on this site. Tom Lowe \nThe article is quite clearly directed at professional freeloaders, and not at unemployed people. Jeremy \nWhile I disagree with much of Michael\u2019s predictions and assertions in his articles (because our nation has come from the brink many times before), he writes on elite welfare and wealth hoarding all the time. \nHe is fair. Leonard \nDear Michael \nIf you take away every single benefit of all these people, you will end up creating plenty of criminals on the streets who will end up in jail getting free food, free air conditioning, libraries, internet, and free health care for many many years to come. You mentioned an article some time ago how somebody checked himself into jail with some kind of a fake holdup in order to get health care in prison. Who do you think will end up paying for this? The banksters? The fat cats? The corporations? Good luck. Remember this: EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE! \nA job is a social program! Somebody has to give it to you when they hire you. When jobs are shipped overseas, then millions are out of work. If people are so happy with lay-offs, they end up paying for it one way or another! How many people are going to become successful like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs? Almost everybody? Good luck. Remember to play the lottery next time, anybody can win $200,000,000,! \nLet me give you a solution, Michael. Let\u2019s bring ALL the jobs back that have been outsourced over the last two decades. Is this going to happen? Of course not! Michael \nLeonard: \nYes, that is why I write about \u201cfree trade\u201d and our trade deficit over and over so that people can understand what is happening. \nMichael VyseLegendaire \n\u201cAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance and at some point the safety net is going to break. \nWhat is our country going to look like when that happens?\u201d \nEgypt. We will have chaos in major metropolitan areas around the nation. Or maybe we are so drug and entertainment-infused that we will simply throw up our hands and pull down our pants for big daddy government. \nOh, and did you forget to mention the amount of people taking subsidized anti-psyochotic medication? When people suddenly come off of their expensive drugs, let us hope their violent outbursts do not reach the level of other well known mass murders associated with coming off of these SSRIs, like Sgt. Bales in Afghanistan. curt \nYes insurance costs have gone up. Why? People are unemployed. Why? Why not, their example has been an industry whose greed is boundless. Lets not forget that if only the top couple of percent of income makers paid their share it could mean clean water, education and health for everyone on this planet. Certain parties have been trying to sink this system without coming up with an alternative and why in the world would anyone not greedy want privatization of natural resourses. Its industry that\u2019s ruining this country and the greed that is their legacy. stan \nAnd on top of that, race wars and riots are coming to a city near you.

Nexus789 \nAmazing number of self righteous pompous individuals. The US has never had welfare state. It is more like a dependency system that has evolved to placate the masses as the US economy has declined and people have adapted to \u2018game\u2019 the system. \nWhat do you expect will happen if millions of jobs and tens of thousands of factories have been closed down and off shored to China, India, etc. What are the millions of unemployed going to do. The payments, food stamps, etc, are ways of keeping the idle masses passive. \nAt some point this will end as the US is bankrupt and austerity measures will be introduced and many of these payments will be withdrawn..no food stamps, no unemployment benefits, no medical support, etc. Then you will all get you wish and reap the consequences.

Max. income tax is 15% of gross salary. Minimum is 2% \nThe Hong Kong government does not have debts. Last year they had so much money left over, they paid every Hong Kong citizen over 18 about USD600. In addition they gave every tax payer a tax rebate of USD600. \nWhat are they doing wrong? de Malfosse \nre: \u201cEver since the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d began our debt has exploded\u201d\u2026 certain amount of accuracy in writing this BUT the \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d ran alongside that other horse in the Imperial race: the Viet Nam War, and the Viet Nam War is the direct source for Americans monetary difficulties today. \nI argue the debt explosion has much, much more to do with the maintenance of Uncle Sam\u2019s Empire, an Imperium where tremendous amounts of American taxes continue to flow outward, then it does with the neighbor on welfare. \nI suggest the \u201cwelfare bum\u201d is an easy & obvious target deliberately promoted by Uncle Sam so as to divert attention from the Empire and it\u2019s 70+ year history of perpetual conflict, war, and interfernece in the affairs of other nations. \nExample: Country XXX (so as not to offend anyone) has itself received an average of 5 millions a day for more than 60 years off the American taxpayers back. Now if that doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201cgov\u2019t parasite\u201d, what or who does? \nIs your neighbor on welfare more damaging then an entire company, say Lockheed-Martin, which hasn\u2019t been off the gov\u2019t teat since Truman was president? Tom Lowe \nExcellent points although they are clearly not directly related to the topic. \nWhat I actually see on the ground here is me working night and day for $800/month after 6 years of college long ago while the completely able bodied guy over there who never bothered to go to school does nothing all month but smoke dope and gets $900. NeoIsolationist \nI work. My wife worked for a long time and is now on unemployment. She would be one of that 49 percent collecting government benefits. She doesn\u2019t want to be on unemployment, and intends to vote against the current administration come November. While lots of that 49 percent wants to continue scamming the system, I\u2019d say there\u2019s some in that group like my wife who don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think 49 percent in and of itself will be enough of a percentage. I could be wrong of course, but I recall hearing that Obama wanted to get about 75 percent of the population getting some kind of government assistance. I think he would agree that 49 percent, while alot, is not enough.

But imo it\u2019s overlooking a critical component to this problem: the breakdown of the family structure. I know your fully aware of this but I just thought it could use some mention. It will be a cold day in hell before I or anyone in my family accept any sort of assistance from .gov. jazzage \nYou are missing three important areas of government dependance in this article. One, the liberal blue states pay more in federal taxes than they get back. That excess goes to the conservative red states that whine about the government but could not exist without their excess of government contracts, military bases, etc. The states of the old Confederacy get almost $2 back for every dollar they pay in. Two, the greatest amount of welfare in this country is money taken by taxing the middle class to subsidize the rich and big business. An example is the private prison industry. We privatize the prisons, the private companies that run these prisons then become lobbyists to bribe the \u201clawmakers\u201d to make more laws making more things illegal so they have more prisoners and more revenue. Three, people with kids have more deductions and pay less taxes to the point where they have essentially zero taxes. Who has the most kids? Mothers on welfare, yes, but also Republicans who get away with paying little or no taxes. Guess who makes up the difference? Those of us with fewer or no kids, generally more liberal people. We also pay full freight on property taxes that fund the public schools. \nThe hypocrisy of conservative morons is astounding. I say let\u2019s get rid of public funding of schools, end all corporate welfare in all its guises, and set the losers in the Southern states out on their own and watch the size of the federal budget plummet. Gary2 \nyou are 100% correct. Michael will never acknowledge that you speak the truth as he does not let facts get in his conservative leanings. \nHow about the welfare of churches and pastors houses, err mansions being tax free. I do not want to subsidize some rich paster of a megachurch. \nPOOR Michael\u2013what ever are you goiong to do when the real facts about welfare are pointed out?? The church is the biggest welfare scam of all. jazzage \nYou are right, I forgot about the Churches that pay no taxes but yet butt their way onto every political conversation and use the power of the Church to promote their idiotic ideas. \nWelfare for those on the bottom exists to prevent rioting in the streets, and welfare for those on the top is the reason the government exists. Gary2 \nits not just churches but pastors homes. Tax payers subsidize these mega church mansions as they are also tax free. Barn Cat \nThe new gold rush is trying to qualify for SSI by being considered legally disabled. Tom Lowe \nI sprained my ankle walking to a job interview. Can I qualify for SSI?!! Dave \nHello All. \nI have been reading this blog for some time, it is good to read some non-mass media propaganda. I however do not subscribe to the notion that USA or the rest of the world will descend into anarchy overnight. It will continue to be a gradual decline over the next 3-5 years, as it has been so far. \nIt is not merely policymakers to blame, but a system that only operates on perpetal growth fuelled by cheap energy. As this energy rises in not only monetary cost,but also energy input costs, economic contraction is inevitable. \nPeak oil is definitely here. Shale and tar sands proves they\u2019re getting desperate. \nOver time, perhaps people may need to return to the rural agrarian lifestyle they had pre-indutrial age,in order to survive. But the sun will stil rise and set. \nI don\u2019t think that anarchy will come either, at least not where I live. Just a slow decay of order. Whatever happens, I would rather die helping my fellow man, content with this life I\u2019ve been lucky to have, than to go down defending my \u201cstash\u201d. \nAs for all this Dec 2012 rubbish, FYI our calendar (gregorian) ends every 400 years. Funnily enough we\u2019re still around. Another Richard \nThe Powerz that be, hold the rip cord on this Gargantuan Unpayable Debt of the USA and Europe.

That is their timeline to commence the New World Oder, I mean Order. I believe we will All be startled and frightened by the Suddeness and the Severity of the Collapse. Jack the Leper \nThe United States Government is the parasite on the hard working people. Gary2 \nJournalist Chris Mooney discusses his new book, \u201cThe Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Reject Science \u2014 and Reality.\u201d \nIn his new book, The Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Reject Science \u2014 And Reality, science journalist Chris Mooney surveys this growing body of data and explains its significance. \nI think the authors mistake is assuming republicans have a brain to begin with. chuck \nIsn\u2019t the government our biggest parasite? Michael \nThe government feeds off of hard working Americans. It\u2019s their lifeblood. Chris \nHmm\u2026 although this won\u2019t be a popular thought, I really feel that the government should not hand out a dime to anyone for any reason. This was what the church was suppose to do. It was suppose to help those, widows, disabled, poor, etc. But, in our \u201canti-Christian\u201d society now, we\u2019ve given, or better stated, expect the government to take care of these and pushed the church out. The church still should be taking care of it\u2019s own though. No matter what kinds of rules the gov\u2019t tries to push. \nAs a side note, what really burns me is that all the so-called atheists, anti-Christians, etc would try to justify that Jesus would have wanted socialism and that the government should take care or it\u2019s people via handouts. That is a completely different Bible from what I read however as the Jesus I knew was very clear about people taking care of themselves and their family. If hardship hit, then the church \u2013 more specifically, other church members (others in your congregation) were suppose to then help you out. But, sadly, most \u201cchurch\u201d goers are now so self-absorbed and Bible deficent that they aren\u2019t willing to help other church members because they think the government should. \nUgh \u2013 catch 22. \nSorry \u2013 my ramble on to a great article that hit a nerve! Eric Ferguson \nThis article is an example of why America is going into massive debt. We have gone from a nation of makers to a nation of takers. People are content to sit on their but and receive enough money from the govt to live on. Yet it is people like me who go to work to support these lazy a$$ people. nowwthen \nThis is not the country I grew up in. As I\u2019ve said before I remember the days in the 60s and 70s when anyone with a high school diploma (and many without one) could find a job with a living wage. There were smokestacks and office buildings all over the country that needed workers. Most from my generation hate that things have devolved into the semi-socialist society Michael has painted here. The corporate lobbyists have convinced our country\u2019s leaders to buy into the belief that tossing U.S. workers into a world labor pool is somehow good for us. Tens of millions of jobs have been lost as a result. Add to that the technological unemployment caused by all of the robotic and computerized replacements for human labor and it\u2019s no wonder that unemployment and underemployment remain at record levels. A person who\u2019s exhausted his or her 99 weeks of unemployment after losing a job they held for 20 years is likely to reason that \u201cthe government caused my job to go away so the government must pay me for what they took from me.\u201d I guess it\u2019s what they refer to as a \u201cmoral hazard\u201d. I\u2019d like to think that most Americans would still prefer to work at a job that paid a decent wage rather than stay on the dole. But sadly that will not happen as long as good American jobs are being eliminated by lopsided \u201cfree trade\u201d policies and productivity gains resulting from more automation with less human labor. Jeremy \nYou think clearly and make good points. Winston Smith \nthough I can agree with your assesment of lack of jobs and good paying ones at that, the problem in part is the result of your statements-we have encouraged and trained people in this nation not to be their own bosses, but employees (wage slaves) dependant on others. Guilds- destroyed largely during the \u201creformation\u201d, which then ushered in a dog-eat-dog, selfish economy, highly individualistic. Said guilds then and could now, provide training, placement, apprenticeships and benefits (health, insurance,etc). During the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, the RCC laity had land associations in the USA and Britain-due to lackluster support of clergy, none from Protestants and a depression/WW II, those died on the vine. Their purpose? to train men how to famr and then, to buy/rent a farm to provide for themselves and others. Ditchling survived, in sorts, until 1989. The men might have gotten training, but nowhere to go and nothing to buy/use/rent afterwards. They then were continually unemployed and stuck in filthy cities. \nOr many has to rely on a lot of ready cash, equity and suck to buy a franchise. A lot more to get a loan from them or a whole lot more to buy their own buisness, plus where then is training? Open a bar/grill? great, would love to do that-do not know the first thing about payroll, taxes, with holding, how and where to order products,etc\u2026. pete \nYes. This is all true and accurate information. \nHere\u2019s some more: \nAfter 27 months of being unemployed, the jobs I am being offered are for about 1/4th of my former salary, while the costs for about everything are about twice as much. \nSo, my choices are get back to work and suck it up like a good sheople\u2026..or do my best to drive a spear into the beast\u2019s heart and try to kill it. More of a mercy killing actually. \nIt boils down to this. Do you buckle down, stiff upper lip, shoulder to the wheel and nose to the grindstone\u2026..or give up? \nI\u2019m going with the idea that supporting the crooked, decietful and errant policies is a loosing game and I am going to be merciful by helping put the ailing beast (US ECONOMY)to death. Right now it\u2019s a wounded and dangerous animal. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2026.if it was possible to nurse it back to health\u2026I\u2019d be on board. However, Bernanke and the politicoes have decided that injecting growth hormones and a diet of five hour energy drinks is practicing good medicine\u2026.so am I evil by wanting to see a suffering animal put to sleep? Tom Lowe \nThis happened to me 25 years ago and I swore then to kill the Beast and I know I am going to win. Tom Lowe \nBTW I got zip in unemployment from the Corporate Pigs. \nZIP \nyou got that right\u2013the jobs are low pay walmart crap. Jeremy \nYour anger is about where I was last July. But, you are still accountable to God for your actions, and He requires that you work and do your best (Apostle Paul: if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat). \nThe misery on this website will not help you either. I used to visit this site daily, but I realized that, while providing some key facts, it is no more knowledgable of the future than you or I. \nDon\u2019t give up. Many days are difficult, but trust me, you WILL find peace in the valley, on the other side. Now I am encouraging people who actually have good jobs. THAT is service, and is a blessing. \nI take the bar exam in July, and look at it more as an adventure to where God will take me. Gemtap \nTrack what they use\u2026.make them pay it back whent they get a real job\u2026if not debtors prison! Cinderella Man \nGood topic, Michael. Now I know why my Dad gets so infuriated around tax time. When I was out of work and unemployment expired, I worked in the \u201cunderground economy\u201d paid under the table because that was the only work there was. I breifly had to get SNAP assistance cause I had no other way to feed myself. Now that Im working again reading articles like this I often have to ask myself Why do I work? Tax time pisses me off too\u2026 I already told you about the welfare mama that got back $8,000 on EIC. She also gets section 8 housing assistance, and food stamps. So basically all you have to do is produce illegetimate children, apply for aid and presto! Set for life!! Keep working fools, millions on welfare depend on you! Michael \nAlmost everyone needs help at some point, but the key is to pick yourself back up and get off of the help and that is exactly what you did. \nI don\u2019t blame those that are going through temporary troubles. But those that have gotten comfortable living off of the system year after year and they never try to get off of it trouble me. \nMichael davidmpark \nNot exactly. \nI\u2019ve been on both sides of this lately, so here\u2019s how things really work. \nI worked as a government contractor until my wife became severely disabled about 5 years ago. So, I left to get a part-time merchandising job with a big box to be closer to her and our young kids. \nThat \u201csafety net\u201d where I live is not very big. \nLIHEAP\u2019s funding, at most, is about 2 months worth of utilities per year. The paperwork cost us about $30 to process and mail, after 4 hours of filling in and photocopying. \nMedicaid is very limited to kids and the disabled \u2013 I\u2019m not covered at all. Every 3 months I have to fill out a 15 page review and send in all related documents to prove everything that I claim. Most of the time, I\u2019m either missing a document or not enough info, so it lapses for about 10 \u2013 15 days. \nSocial Security \u2013 Disability has been a trial and half! We finally got full disability after 4 years, more than 1000 documents, and a law firm. For this, it\u2019s not much; about $1100 per month. And since there really isn\u2019t housing assistance from everyone else already on that program (been on the waiting list for 4 years), almost all goes to rent. \nOur kids do an online charter school (and doing well, they can actually read and do the math! The school district is an abysmal failure), but we can\u2019t qualify for discounted (not free) internet because we have to cut service for 3 months before we can apply. We can\u2019t do that unless we let the kids fall way behind. \nWe don\u2019t qualify for the cell phone discount (again, not free) cause I\u2019m still working part-time. I need to quit to get that one; but if I do, the wife looses medical coverage and a few others. \nIt\u2019s not a fun system: and I don\u2019t spend time waiting for a check \u2013 I spend a lot of time trying to build what we can afford to create our own utilities and grow food, looking for a better job to work-from-home because, as I said before, she is severely disabled and needs me here! I get up at 5 AM, got work \u2019till 11 (if I\u2019m lucky and she doesn\u2019t have a seizure or something \u2013 then I have to stay home all day), then clean house, help the kids with school, fill out paperwork, cook what I can, and then, if I\u2019m blessed, do some stuff in the workshop and then go to bed at 12 AM. \nThis is not a paradise; it\u2019s near to hell! I don\u2019t know who is profiting so much from being on these programs, but I know it ain\u2019t us! And from the experiences while working for the federal government, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the bureaucrats running the programs that are living the sweet life! Some of those guys make over $100,000 per year salary alone and spend most of their time in meetings. Tom Lowe \nYour case just illustrates how those who really do need help have such difficulty getting it in a system clogged with rank freeloaders. \nI know numerous fully able bodied mentally competent people who get SSI of $900 +/- or large Veteran mental disability payments up to $2500 and more who do NOTHING. Most of them are actually alcoholics or pill people. \nI knew a guy who gets $2500\u2013plus SS\u2013for some concocted mental disability (PTSD from a military helicopter accident? Come on, liar-actor! This was not even in combat). He came to me on the 11th of the month whining that he was already broke. Well he has lived in a van for the past 43 years while he freeloaded off of the phony PTSD disability. So he spent $2500 in 11 days living it up to the tune of $225+ per day and shows up broke and whining on the 11th here where we self sufficient people have had way more than our share of dumpster meals just to keep this roof over our head. \nI sent him to Camp FEMA, so to speak. \nI often have to work for myself for as little as $1-$2 per hour, and have for many years now. All you out there who think there is some sort of automatic minimum wage had better realize there is no such thing if you intend to survive. davidmpark \nThanks Tom mondobeyondo \nAll one needs to do to see government efficiency at its best, is to go to the local Department of Motor Vehicles office to get your vehicle registered. There are 30 counters available. Two employees, at two counters, are assisting customers. Some 600 or so people sitting, staring at screens, or chasing their kids. Already a bad sign. \nPress the little green button on the machine near the entrance. Your ticket reads \u201cnumber 863\u2033. \nThe loudspeakers announce, \u201cNow serving number 108\u2033. \nCome on \u2013 even the Post Office is better than this! Gary2 \nthere are only 2 employees at the DMV because right wing gov like the soon to be replaced walker cut cut cut. \nStop voting repube. Diane C \nIt is really people like you who do need the help, and are not able to get enough. The problem is the entire system (government) is broke. There are those who really take advantage, and there are those who really need it. You would think because the government is so big and bloated, they would have enough people to check on these things. However you would have to be efficient in order to do that. Our government certainly is not. \nI wish you and your family the best. davidmpark davidmpark \nOkay, I need to clarify some things. \nMy wife has an actual disability: severe traumatic brain injury, that caused epilepsy and a few other things. She was in a coma for almost a year and had to relearn most everything. It will cost her her life. It\u2019s real \u2013 not easy to fake those CT scans and the other numerous tests. \nSecond, I don\u2019t know how to game this system: I give \u2019em all the requested info, they tell me what we can get. Honesty doesn\u2019t pay off with these guys: and that\u2019s the point! \nWe HATE being on these programs! Using that EBT card in public is the most embarrassing thing; and the stares the cashier gives me is just damning. I hide the card best I can when swiping it and then quickly stash the eyesore away. When the receptionist at the doc\u2019s office asks about insurance, I always whisper the answer. \nIf these gov people want to do something right and good (for once); then pass a law that voids zoning laws for families that have a legitimately disabled member. I am capable of rearing animals and producing things here, but am limited because these guys want us on castrating programs that serve themselves! \nWe have food storage, but it\u2019s pretty basic now. And as someone here mentioned: if we don\u2019t have these programs, they\u2019ll take the kids and force my wife into assisted living \u2013 a kind of partial divorce. \nThis isn\u2019t the society I wanted; this is where I\u2019m stuck! Phillip Sherwood \nThe people I personally know who \u201cwork the system\u201d aren\u2019t getting rich but just treading water since they double up with family members and work low wage jobs. If they didn\u2019t \u201cwork the system\u201d they wouldn\u2019t have enough to eat or their children wouldn\u2019t be able to access health care. Many are caught up in drug abuse or alcoholism and are hardly able to maintain themselves. Some work very hard at low wage jobs and some don\u2019t work at all. I agree at one level that throwing money at these people is worthless but cutting them off is just as bad since the children are the ones who suffer. I remember at the church I grew up in that what worked wasn\u2019t monetary policy but individual assistance and genuine caring. Our pastor went to great lengths to assist a member who had a mentally ill mother and neither the pastor nor the church got a thing out of it except the right thing was done and people knew that this man and this congregation cared. My youth pastor said \u201cam I my brothers keeper?\u201d I thought he was referring to the specific scripture and I fumbled the answer but the Bible is clear from cover to cover what the answer is. Tom Lowe \nYou missed the whole point of the article. It states that there are too many freeloaders burdening a well-intentioned system designed for the truly needy. It never says or even implies that needy people should not get help. What it says is that people who AREN\u2019T needy are robbing the system. Stan522 \nI agree with you. Government sustenance programs are over burdened. However, over burdening is inevitable. Since government defines \u201csuccess\u201d only when they can increase their budget, and/or getting as many people reliant on it, you will always grow a program of free-loaders. By definition, this will always happen. \nNow, we have politicians openly feeding people with guilt for not putting up with supporting these ridiculous programs. They equate charitable \u201cgiving\u201d of your money to private support programs to you supporting government taking your money and creating a program. They are not the same thing. Government will ALWAYS be more inefficient. Gary2 \nam I my brothers keeper \nThat passage is not in Michaels and the other \u201cChristians\u201d on this site. Stan522 \nGubamint programs are not supposed to make you rich. They are intended to keep you captive into a low level of sustenance where politicians can get you to keep voting for them as they play the system and put you into a voting block that will ensure their continued candidacy. That goes for ANY program: \nHome Mortgage Interest Deduction Hope or Lifetime Learning Tax Credit Student Loans Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit Earned Income Tax Credit Food Stamps (did I miss any\u2013?) \nNone of these will provide people with what they need. All they will do is get you hooked just like a crack addict. Tell you friend to break away from government handouts and find their own way to success. It\u2019s inside of every single one of us. It\u2019s God given and we just need to unleash it. Stan522 \nI believe we are at that point where there may be more takers than givers in our society. The politician\u2019s are now so open about how if you vote for them, they will give \u201cyou\u201d free stuff. This \u201csafety net\u201d and how politicians have leveraged it into voting blocks has destroyed our country. Their political greed (power and money) has enticed the weak to become weaker by accepting these bribes. It\u2019s immoral and should be illegal to destroy the drive for success, self-reliance, and determination out of American\u2019s. Michelle \nYou have no idea just how much that hit home. God bless you jox \nVery unfair and disappointing article! You talk about a pitiful state of things in America, and suddenly, without justification, you equates it with a \u201cEuropean-style socialist welfare\u201d that destroys your nation \u201csocially and financially\u201d. Even worse, you end with that picture, which has NOTHING to do with the content of the article. \nIf you don\u2019t like socialism, OK, let\u2019s discuss it with arguments. But this method of picking something that you don\u2019t like and associate it somehow with the socialism is very unfair and not appropriate for your otherwise brilliant articles. It is exactly the same as when the far left blames any problem in the world on America and capitalism. \nAnd, by the way, let me inform you that some of the more \u201csocially and economically\u201d advanced and prosperous countries in the world are European and socialists (or social-democrats, if this word exists in English). You are going to have a hard time finding arguments against the ethics and politics of those countries, which are a model for everybody. Tom Lowe \nEveryone but Europe knows that Europe are the biggest freeloaders in the entire world. \nThe biggest. Tom Lowe \nIn fact, Europe is nothing but a whole subcontinent wholly dedicated to freeloading off of the rest of the world, and has been for centuries now. Gary2 \nMichael is becoming an idological right wing warrior where facts are whatever he hears on fox. He can no longer think for him self. This crap was probably transcribed from rush pill head bimbo show. DownWithLibs \nI see you have even more screws loose than you did before. So sad\u2026we pity you!!!! knightowl77 \nWell they are not a model that I would like to emulate. We\u2019ll see where they are in 3 to 5 years, but I do not ever think I will support Gov\u2019ts taking from one group to provide to another\u2026. \nThat is not the role of any gov\u2019t that I would care to be subject to\u2026.you can keep it\u2026 Barn Cat \nA lot of government jobs are necessary jobs. A lot of those people are incredibly arrogant. They think they\u2019re God because they work for the government. I saw that when I worked for the Census and my superiors had to deal with people who worked for the Department of Commerce. But those people are nothing compared to God. Bobby \nthe line at 2:14 applies here\u2026 Bernadette \nEvery time I read something like this it makes my blood boil. It\u2019s this mindset which is making me fight tooth and nail to get my SSI which I worked most of my life paying into. I\u2019m dissabled now. I have a list of illnesses longer than my left arm, and SSI has denied me and now I have to try to find a way to drive 200 miles away to go to some court hearing. You people seem to think it\u2019s so easy to get gov help when you need it. It\u2019s NOT! I\u2019ve been trying to get my SSI benefits since 2009 when I finally became too sick to work. I worked for years with my illnesses, but they got too bad for me to manage in 2009 and I just couldn\u2019t do it any more. Bernadette \nBTW I would much rather be able to get up and go to work everyday like I used to. I miss working, it\u2019s ridiculous to think that people who were created to create and work would rather sit and be sick, just so that they could get a few hundred dollars every month for free. Talk about socialism, that was Hitler\u2019s mind set \u201cLet the strong survive and the weak go to the wall\u201d That\u2019s why I can\u2019t believe there are so many Believers who are against public assistance. The Church is supposed to take care of sick people like me, not the gov. The Church isn\u2019t supposed to be robbing old ladies of their SS, there supposed to be caring for them. And Christians certainly shouldn\u2019t be complaining about services to assist sick and old people. Oh well it will all come out of the wash when JESUS gets back. Even so Please come quickly Lord JESUS. Cinderella Man \nBernadette, I woundnt be mad at you for getting SSI its perfectly healthy young teenagers and 20 somethings that say they have \u201cdepression\u201d or \u201cbi-polar\u201d and get to sit around and goof off all day while the rest of us foot the bill. BTW the reason that most people are depressed is because your govt. is tyrranical and you are materialistic!! Tom Lowe \nEXACTLY!! \nAnd then there are all the phony 420 patients, PTSD phantoms, pain pill puppies, and more! Gary2 \nmost 90% Christians are hypoctrites to the max. All one need do is read this site for proof of that. Stan522 \nThey will be left behind\u2026\u2026.. Another Richard \nNo, you are wrong. All 90% Christians are hypocrites. Only 100% Christians are Truely Christian. Another news flash for you buster \u2013 Only God can see the heart of any person and He alone Knows the True from the Hypocrite. So, quit wasting your energy trying to pick who is and who isn\u2019t a True Christian,because it is useless. Examine your own life and relationship to God is the best thing you could do for yourself and others. Ozmo \nThank you so much for that post. It would do well for everyone to live by this. Just my 2 cents Stan522 \nIsn\u2019t that just like government\u2026. create programs with big promises, make it near impossible to attain, move the goal posts mid game (extending the qualifying years out farther and farther), then steal from it, bankrupt it and then pander to the voting block of retirees and near retirees to garner more votes for the ones who bastardized it in the first place. \nOur problem is \u201cwe\u201d keep believing these SOB\u2019s every time they speak. Be wary of ANY politician coming up with a gubamint program that takes care of \u201cus\u201d. Besides, there isn\u2019t enough to live on once you get it. I would have rather kept my own money for the 40+ years (and still going) instead of giving it to the ripoff artists. \nMy beef is not with you who worked their whole life and believed the promises of politicians. My issue is with bastard (redundant) politicians that make false promises and then leverage votes promising more free \u201cstuff\u201d. They all can go straight to hell\u2026\u2026 mondobeyondo \nRemember that scene in the movie \u201cTitanic\u201d, where Jack asks Rose to hold onto her hand as the ship sinks? \n\u201cYou jump, I jump!\u201d No, wrong scene! It\u2019s the scene where the ship is taking the final plunge to the bottom. The undertow would have sucked anyone near the ship under water. \nThe USA is the Titanic. The people abusing the system, depend on the U.S. government for their survival. They will be dragged underwater. (Some of them already are. \u201cUnderwater mortgages\u201d.. wink, wink!) And they will suck everyone else under along with them. Chris \nIn the pyramid of wealth that could describe the population you would have parasites at the very top and at the bottom. At the very top the 1% also live a parasitic existence. I mean people like bankers/ CEOs and others who produce nothing and get rich by scamming those below and basically living a parasitic existence on those that actually do work, the middle of the pyramid. Under the middle there is a large population of an underclass some of whom are genuine hardworking people and some who game the system. The middle supports the lower and the upper parts of the pyramid. A host can only support a certain amount of its energy going to a parasite living on it. Too much energy lost and too many parasites and the host will be killed. This stage must be getting close. Those at the top with their corruption and fraud and greed set the example for those below to follow. When faced with corruption at the top and indolence below the middle will lose heart, see it\u2019s supporting a unjust system and may give up. CitizenS \nBeen a Paramedic for 21 years now and I have continually see things worsening. People used to call for EMS when they or a loved one was sick, now it seems we\u2019re just a \u2018free\u2019 taxi service. Sadly they don\u2019t realize or care that while they are being hauled around someone may actually need our service. And even though they aren\u2019t paying foir it\u2026\u2026.. I AM!!! I\u2019m all about giving a people a hand up, but I\u2019m getting tired of a third of my pay going to buy them cell phone minutes and the like. I built my own house payday to payday and I own the land. My family and I are putting up feeder pigs and a calf and just broke the sod on 2 acres of ground for a garden. We have wind power when there\u2019s a breeze and 3 underground springs on site. By all means let it collapse. Then these parasites will be forced to work!! Again Michael, good article. Michael \nThey use you for a free taxi service? \nThat is just sad. \nMichael CitizenS \nIn this state (WV) an individual can activate EMS, not give a reason, and state which hospital they want to go to and we have to take them. They do not even have to give us there name if they so choose. We call it a \u2018you call we haul\u2019. And on top of that many use the non emergency ambulances because they don\u2019t want to spend the money on gas or the bus to go to Dr. Visits and other non urgent medicals. I love my state and only wish that we and other states would reform our system. That by itself could save countless money and lives\u2026.. the optimist \nOh Yay for you. Don\u2019t you get it \u2014 you built your house paycheck to paycheck \u2014 there are millions of us out here who don\u2019t have the paycheck! And we don\u2019t because of the CEO parasites and 1% parasites who are all about churning and grabbing money over jobs. Outsourcing, golden parachutes, whatever, the jobs are gone and they aren\u2019t coming back. \nDon\u2019t be so grossly smug and superior. I just lost my house, which was my prepping homestead. I did all those homesteading things for years too, but without a good source of income, when my business failed 2 years ago, I lost it. DON\u2019T think for a SINGLE SECOND that you are invulnerable and incapable of losing YOUR paycheck \u2014 YOU CAN LOSE IT ALL. \nThen maybe you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of reality. \n\u201cThen these parasites will be forced to work!!\u201d \nHateful. Don\u2019t you think \u201cwe\u201d WANT to have jobs?? FOOL, hateful fool. Please read Karol\u2019s comment below. The real parasites are at the top, in DC and in corporate boardrooms. CitizenS \nIf smug and being a fool means harsh austerity @ home (eating ramen, bologna sandwiches, working by myself til 3 in the morning on my house then getting up to be @ work @ 0800 (in which I couldn\u2019t even claim the $8000 tax credit because I didn\u2019t borrow from the banksters), and scratching odd jobs on days off) is smug then I guess that shoe fits. Did I work the system? No. Do I live in the lap of luxury? No. Have I gone without to provide a roof and food for my family? Yes. Am I prepared for what is coming? I hope so. I feel for anyone that looses their job, I really do, I\u2019ve been there before. My comment was not meant to be condescending towards anyone. But I will say this and its as timeless today as it ever has been\u2026\u2026. Judge only a man after you have traveled in his footsteps. libertyin413 \nIn the interest of not repeating what others have said, I would just like to add that I don\u2019t believe that we should have any of these government \u201cbenefits\u201d or \u201csafety nets\u201d at all. The only thing the government can to is tax (read:steal) from producers and assist (read:redistribute) others. And it\u2019s not just the \u201cpoor\u201d receiving benefits/entitlement [sic], the connected elite get their welfare too. Government setting up these safety nets only exacerbates any problem that may have existed because now prices skyrocket as providers know any increase will be backed by the full faith and credit of the US Tax Payer; this hurts the very people the program was intended to help in the first place. All assistance should be done by private local charity as it was before. This way it is truly just a temporary helping hand when someone hits hard times and the organization/church can monitor for fraud. For the Progressives who claim this doesn\u2019t work, we never read about having to step over alternating piles of child prostitutes and dying old people in the street as you tried to make your way to your sweatshop job. The standard of living was increasing like history has never seen before when people were allowed to keep the fruits of their own labor (a one income household could support 5-6 people, children were being better educated, new cars & appliances, etc\u2026). Now under the Progressive model the standard of living is decreasing drastically as once again everyone has to contribute to the household income and the need to hop on the safety net has reached unprecedented levels. Lastly, even if the producers are lucky enough to retain some of their earnings and try to defer some of it for later consumption, they are hit again with the hidden tax of inflation that destroys their wealth and actually decreases their purchasing power. All of this made possible through the criminal and malevolent actions of the Federal Reserve. Karol \nHi Michael, Thank you for writing such honest and informative articles. I no longer watch the news or read the local papers because it is mostly all rubbish. Your website is fascinating and I have recommended your site to all my friends and family. No body likes a lazy cheat who games the system for a living, but I am fed up with the parasitical Wall Street Fat Cats, the Politicians, the criminals in D.C. And the 1%, who having been gaming the system for decades at our expense. These rich crooks have stolen billions from the American people, far more than the food stamp family ever will in a life time. BofA paid no federal tax in 2010 and got a billion dollar rebate as well, and I read that they paid no federal tax in 2011 either. When companies that make billions of dollars and give out millions of dollars in bonuses every year don\u2019t pay federal or state tax then the tax payer is robbed. On a local level police and fire stations are affected, schools too. Bridges and roads aren\u2019t being repaired. These parasites send their children to the best schools, they vacation all over the world, own multiple homes with tennis courts and pools, multiple cars and jets, they get to eat the best food, probably cooked by the in-house chef, they have housekeepers and nannies, they have the best health care money can buy, I could go on and on. Disney, a multi-billionaire company, got welfare for a fireworks display and multi-millionaire Sam Donaldson got welfare for mohair. Really! Our schools suck, minimum wage adjusted to inflation should be $22.50 an hour, people are getting screwed out of time-and-a-half, over-time, vacation time, their pensions, health care, etc. And if you work you are lucky if you can get 20 hours a week! Wage theft is the best way for the 1% to steal from the 99%. Most people are so Ignorant they don\u2019t even realize they are being robbed. I worked for the 1% in a private club in Boston, they docked my paycheck for 3 weeks of work. I am a poor single mother, and the richest people felt the need to steal 3 weeks of my wages. Wow! I couldn\u2019t afford to work for free so I had to quit. Do I begrudge the obese, lazy, and unmotivated for scamming the system? Not really. Especially since there ain\u2019t a Benz or a Jag in their driveway, no lawn service for their patch of grass, or a maid to clean up after their sub-par, high-fructose, hydrogenated, sodium laced, junk food dinners, and if they get fuel assistance to keep warm while eating their food-stamp dinner and watching Judge Judy, then good for them. Michael \nKarol: \nYes, I have written many articles about the corruption of the banksters and the elite as well. \nI am definitely not on their side. \nMichael Mr. G \nYou are largely right, Karol. Many people who are not doing well would do far better if they were dishonest. \nThat\u2019s what bothers me about the US today \u2013 no real earned privilege, just lots and lots of unearned, unfair big cash going to some fat-cats who are RUINING THE COUNTRY at the same time they are getting all that money! I mean, they could at least do a good job for all that cash. I don\u2019t think they even try, really. \nGood luck! Jimmy \nOnce citizens find out that they can vote themselves MONEY (i.e. the democratic party and has already occured) the system is heading straight to hell and is destined for failure. kHRIStu4 \nTo honestly fix problems like this we need free energy. It is possible, just held up by corporations(owned by bankers) who own the government. Its all about control. This is one more thing added to the list to divide people and keep them docile. \nIts a long movie (about 2hr). Some stuff may be way out there but have an opened mind.

Corey Lewis \nWOW! What a great article! Loved it! My ex-wife has been one of these friggin parasites for 15 years and doing her best to raise my kids in that lifestyle\u2026over my dead and rotting body I say.

Rick \nI know of at least one parasite in particular that lived off my older sister for many years. After she finally divorced the leach, he\u2019s now on government subsistence.

Mike S. \nWhen a person loses their job the first thing you do is apply for unemployment. After that runs out and your savings run out and your food runs out and you have kids. Do you honestly think the government will let you live off dehydrated food that is on the shelf in the basement? You will be on foodstamps and medicaid or they WILL take your kids! If you can\u2019t show proof of income, regardless of my house paid for and enough money(at the time)to pay my bills for another year. The first time you take you kids to E.R. for something it opens up a whole crap of worms if you don\u2019t have insurence. Just for stitches from a bike accident I now have my kids on Medicaid and foodstamps. I try to be positive about the government waste and use all they give on foodstamps to restock my shelves for the next go around. I will be pleased to answer any questions about my situation, even negative ones. I get on this site daily and this is my first comment. Michael \nYou make some very good points there. \nMichael Tom Lowe \nYou are not the person we are talking about. We are talking about lots of fully able bodied people who not only scam for all the gummint benefits but who also work in the underground economy year in and year out. tex \nYeah you hypocrites are always talking about some other person- not the person in front of you who has real need. \nYes there are abusers- but in my experience most people would rather work for their money walking to work over broken glass than jump through all of the hoops the bureaucracy demands for their meager pittance. \nThe fact is that the US economy is in the toilet and the sheeple are going to let Romney flush it. There are not enough jobs, not even in the cash economy. $6 to $10 an hour jobs won\u2019t pay the rent and feed a man\u2019s kids. \nWhen there is no alternative, people will work the government system to eat or they will turn to crime or justice in the streets- and there are not enough guns in this country to turn that tide once it starts. \nI think it is time quit with the rhetoric and get real- or it is all going to end very badly for us all. mondobeyondo \nI forgot about the kids aspect of the situation (I do not have children). \nWhoa\u2026 talk about growing up fast! Children in these dire situations don\u2019t need to ask what a \u201cbudget\u201d is. erheault \nAs we wander down the road to total automation in our industrys the need for middle and lower semi skilled labor will dwindle and the unemployed and the unable to work will multiply we will face a revolt as all other nation in the past and present have or now undergoing, How this will work out is unknown but it will happen to us, it dont matter who is president or in congress. no nation or country in history has survived by devaluing their monies or massive unemployment which is where we are heading, Enjot the ride as it will be historic to say the least.

Later.We Tom Lowe \nI\u2019m a landlord in a lower middle class neighborhood, and down to 105 lb from 135 lb in 2007 for lack of food and time to cook it. There is almost nothing but professional freeloaders for as far as the eye can see from here. I could tell all of you stories about freeloaders that would make your blood boil right off. My only hope is that the gummint finally stops issuing the by-now absurd freeloader checks and benefits and sends all of the professional freeloaders to Camp FEMA, right next to the bankster criminals and right where they all belong until they get off their dead butts and start doing something for themselves. And I don\u2019t mean maybe! Cinderella Man \nMy goodness man!! You need to bulk up on protien powders and high fructose corn syrup immedietly!! 105?? Thats skinny!! no offense. Tom Lowe \nIt\u2019s scary. I\u2019m surrounded by a sea of human sinkers. That means I have to do everything for myself and half of what they need done for themselves. There\u2019s just not enough time or money to eat well enough\u2013especially after all the coffee, cigs, feeding several spoilt cats, and whatever else I might decide to indulge in, like several hours of reading blog comments. \nOK\u2013so ya caught me! !!!! Eva \nYup, it\u2019s not a good time for jobs or growth or prosperity and it won\u2019t be until we get rid of the man in the Oval Office and replace him with someone who takes creating a business-friendly environment seriously. And returning Congress to baseline budgeting. They haven\u2019t been since the 1974 Budget Reform Act, which adds 10% annually to each federal budget regardless of necessity and I hardly need add regardless of federal revenue. sharonsj \nArticles like this piss me off. Right-wingers like to blame anybody who is struggling to survive\u2013but they never attack corporate welfare. \nExxonMobil earned $5 billion a year for the past four years and not only paid no tax but got a tax refund! Corporations get away with murder and rob us blind, but their execs are not in prison, are they? But let some guy steal food from a grocer cause he can\u2019t afford to buy meat and he lands in jail. \nI don\u2019t know why I remain amazed at the stupidity of the American public to swallow Republican talking points, but I am. If you folks don\u2019t learn how to look up facts on your computers, instead of being yes men, you\u2019ll help the Repubs steal what\u2019s left of the country. Michael \nI have written quite a bit about the corporations that pay no taxes and about all of the corporate welfare that takes place. \nMichael Gary2 \n100 articles on the poor to 1 on the corporate welfare. Come on Michael\u2013I see through your bs. Michael \nGary you know that I hit Goldman Sachs far harder than I hit the poor. \nMichael Gary2 \nI said corporate welfare not just goldman sucks. and no you bash the poor way more than the corporate welfare which is a FAR bigger cost. sharonsj \nEconomist Richard Wolff pointed out that over the last 30 years, corporations (along with government) have rigged the system so that they now pay only 25 cents in taxes for each $1 of tax paid by the average citizen. He also said that if people understood how they were being screwed we\u2019d have a second American revolution. Michael \nYes, I discussed corporate taxation quite a bit in the article I just posted. \nMichael Winston Smith \nTrue, but that never seems to upset \u201cconservatives\u201d, who benefit a lot from Big Govt/Big Biz.Their answer? Just lower taxes (but not spending) and \u201cget the Govt out of the way\u201d. El Pollo de Oro \n\u201cI call them GC\u2019s three Gs: guns, gold and a getaway plan.\u201d\u2014Gerald Celente \nMichael T. Snyder write: \u201cAs economic conditions get even worse in this country, millions more Americans are going to turn to the government for assistance, and at some point, the safety net is going to break.\u201d Yes, and when it does break, God help The Banana Republic of America (formerly the USA). That\u2019s when things are going to get really nasty in this Third World nightmare. I\u2019ve often said that when the going gets tough, the desperate do desperate things. They rob, they steal, they sell drugs, they mug, they carjack, they kidnap. They do all the things that make it so dangerous to live in Caracas, Ciudad Juarez, Port Moresby, Guatemala City, Kingston and a long list of other Third World cities with high rates of violent crime. They collect the dreaded Desperate People Doing Desperate Things Tax (DPDDTT), which is what the wealthy minority end up paying when they\u2019re surrounded by a dirt-poor majority. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think people realize just how evil and what an abomination our country has become.\u201d\u2014Alex Jones \n\u201cAmerica\u2019s not the same place it used to be. And when you look at the decline going on in this country, how anybody can believe that the dollar is going to be a reserve currency is beyond me.\u201d\u2014Gerald Celente \nNot all Third World countries are ultra-dangerous. I\u2019ve visited Morocco, which has a lot of poverty but doesn\u2019t have a lot of violent crime (only a lot of touts trying to sell you a carpet that you don\u2019t need). But I definitely see the BRA moving in the direction of the really violent and dangerous Third World countries, where kidnappings are a way of life and the cops are often in cahoots with the thugs. So if you think Baltimore, Detroit, Philadelphia and St. Louis are bad now, just wait\u2014the worst is yet to come. And rural places aren\u2019t necessarily going to be all that safe either when the you-know-what hits the fan (some small towns in Mexico are extremely dangerous). \nOf course, smart preppers understand all these things. They\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve been listening to Alex Jones, Gerald Celente, Paul Craig Roberts, Gary Johnson and Ron Paul and realize that those guys aren\u2019t alarmists\u2014they\u2019re telling it like it is, and the truth ain\u2019t pretty. \nIf you have a gun, I recommend keeping it in a safe, secure place and knowing how to use it. That gun will come in handy when the DPDDTT collectors come a knockin\u2019 here in The Banana Republic of America. William \nThe real government \u201cparasites\u201d are actually 90% of all federal workers (GS & WG). These federal employees are grossly OVERPAID, and do little work. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to fire one of these slackers once they get tenure. My brother-in-law retired as a GS-14. In his last job in Wash DC, he TOOK NEWSPAPERS and MAGAZINES to work to read BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO Most civil service and wage grade federal workers sit around doing very little except for reading their benefits manual. That is a HARD FACT! TX4Life \nMost have tv\u2019s in their offices, paid for by the taxpayer, that they watch several hours a day. No one wants confrontation so they ignore it. Or they let it go because they also watch tv a good portion of the day. Some work other jobs during their required GS/WG hours even though it is prohibited. Again, no one wants confrontation so they look the other way. Some come and go as they please, never listing time off on their weekly time cards as required. At the end of the year, they take most of December off to \u201cuse or lose\u201d their accumulated \u201ctime off\u201d. It will continue and grow worse because no one is willing to do anything about it. Me \n$50,000 * 0.3 = $15,000 where 0.3 = 30% tax rate. \n$50,000 \u2013 $15,000 = $35,000 /12 = $2916 a month. \n$2916. \nNot $4000. $2916. It\u2019s even crazier than you think. By quite a wide margin. \nAdd to that I\u2019d love to see you find a rent of $1000 in Los Angeles. Anywhere. \nTry it. \nMinimum is $1400 and that\u2019s if you\u2019re living in hell with a bed that folds up into the wall. \nI\u2019m seriously considering building a cabin on some nice land in the middle of nowhere and buying a 20 year supply of Ramen noodles. I hear you can\u2026\u201cfeed\u201d (if it can be called such a thing) yourself on them for $142 a YEAR. Mr. G \nI have known plenty who are parasites. They really do work the system amazingly well. I once worked a charity-related job in a city where I found that people coming from Latin-American countries had welfare forms filled out before they even got on the plane to come here. That\u2019s rotten. \nBut it is also rotten that those who really try often can\u2019t get any help at all! That is why I know much welfare is a scam. We should be willing to help those who need it and deserve it. But, we tend to help those who don\u2019t deserve it. \nFor example, many poor American kids who can\u2019t read get no special help, while foreign nationals who are going here while their parents get educated or work fancy professional jobs get special English tutors on the tax-payers\u2019 dime. When are we going to wake up and help those we should? \nBut never, never turn against helping those who have it coming. This is one reason I cannot even support Republicans anymore. (I never did support Democrats) Too mean-spirited, too many people who have never been down and out! DaytoDay \nGood Article Michael, \nI had to take some time away from the doom and gloom for a while, although, it is impossible to escape it entirely. \nI agree with this article, I know people 1st hand who are on welfare, some in my own family who have been on welfare/govt assistance most of their adult lives. \nI worked at Walmart at one time, and one of the guys I worked with used to be a construction worker and was on welfare for 2yrs before they cut him off, he was receiving $1,000/month while on welfare compared to the $800/month working at Walmart. \nSo, I can understand why some people choose to leach off the system \u201cforever\u201d, because it literally pays more to be dependent than independent\u2026 \nStay Strong and Keep Up the Good Work! David Gurney \nNew GOP slogan:If you believe in hope,you must be a dope. Mad Max \nThe truth is, none of us really have to work hard anymore. Why get mad at the people who discovered that first. Only a sucker wants to work hard. Work is just a modern extension of slavery from ancient times. That\u2019s why people want to become rich. Because they want to be free. Free to do what they want when they please. Only a jaded fool wants to work hard, and only a jaded fool would criticize others that don\u2019t want to kill themselves making someone else\u2019s dream come true. I\u2019d rather spend more time with my family and doing the things I really love to do. Do you think the 1% care about working their butts off, NO! They care about working your butts off. It is the stupid 99% that persist in this nonsense and guess what? You\u2019ve gotten your wish. We behave like slaves then we complain about how we are treated. \nWake up! \nRead \u201cCommon Sense 3.1\u201d at ( http://www.revolution2.osixs.org ) FIGHT THE CAUSE \u2013 NOT THE SYMPTOM \nHow else can I say this? \u201cWe Are Free!\u201d http://WeAreFree.osixs.org John Rambo \nNevermind that most welfare people are WOMEN. Women bankrupted America. They sucked the system dry with all of their special women\u2019s rights and privledges, and also they drove away all of the big corporations who are afraid of frivilous lawsuits from women. \nAmerican women are sue-happy. They will sue a company or their employer for the stupidest of reasons. So can you really blame the corporations for outsourcing to countries that are not so radical feminist-like? \nAmerican women are the main ones that destroyed America. Feminism destroyed America. \nWhen are you going to start blaming the real culprits, Michael? When are you going to grow some balls and start speaking the TRUTH, instead of watering it down like a ? Michael \nMichael John Rambo \nYes but you RARELY call out WOMEN and FEMINISTS as being the main cause behind the economic collapse of America. \nAlso, American women destroyed TENS OF MILLIONS of men\u2019s lives FINANCIALLY through the divorce courts. \nSo financially destroying TENS OF MILLIONS of men\u2019s lives didn\u2019t help the economy either. \nWhen are you going to directly expose the WOMEN as the primary culprits behind this collapse? tex \nJoh Rambo? Sure you\u2019re not Rick Santorum out slumming? Gary2 \nive paid into this system that people are using.i personally know of 10 people using the system to get ssi only one is disabled the rest lied to get ssi. you lie and keep saying your depressed my back hurts etc. etc. etc. i read these coments and funny how all these people diserve ssi and none of these people are lieing to get it. give me back my money and i shouldnt have to help strangers with my money i paid into it with,hell i could retire,ive paid into this since i was 15 im 48. if your a man get a dam job and quit faking if you can work period,i know about it taking four to five yr. it didnt stop those bums i know that are on it,dont forget to tell the people here they back pay you all that money did you. sorry what it comes down to is i shouldnt have to support any stranger,i will help me and my family and no one else and that includes food stamps. i get one third of my money taken in taxs and etc. then i spend it and get taxed again,i dont care who you are,i shouldnt have to raise you as if your a child,get a job even if its flippin handburgers-enough is enough \nsorry they taken the comas out and ran the sentences together but youll get the point Gay Veteran \n\u201c\u2026Ever since the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d began our debt has absolutely exploded and yet now there are more poor people in this country than ever before\u2026.\u201d \nFACTS please?

Both parties are to blame. \nMichael tom singa \nyes they are all to blame, and until obama debt was increasing slightly which needed to be put under control, , but Obama ,he has doubled the debt himself, period there is no way to argue otherwise Evie \nAmerica is rapidly turning into a European-style socialist welfare state \nThe evidence says not! \nI wish we were a european socialist state tex \nor even a Canadian style Conservative one\u2026. tom singa \nwell then leave go there and live Gary2 \nMichael-ALL estimates are that between 3-5% of the welfare recepients are getting benefits fraudently and gaming the system. While I know focusing on the 3-5% who abuse the system makes for a better headline you are ignoring the 95-97% who get benefits that if they did not get they would die. for the most part literally. \nI know in your ayn rand wet dream that is how you may want the world to be\u2013social darwin like that fool paul ryan but what what a horrible world that would be. \nFor the record I do believe that those 3-5% who are abusing the system need to be kicked off and dealt with. Gary2 \nHow about all the corporate welfare and welfare for the rich? That is WAY more than ANY welfare for the poor. \nMichael\u2013turn off fox, you can do better. Gary2 \n49 percent of all Americans live in a home that receives some form of government benefits. \nBecause the wall street corporate bailouts put the economy into a recession. You need to finish the tape to the end. \nMichael\u2013stop being sop disingenuinous. you know better. Gary2 \nmichael\u2013too one sided\u2013what about the corporate parasites??and the rich parasites who own congress?

MisterC \nThen haunt some other blog TROLL! Gary2 \nnice hypocritical Christian referring to Gods children as parasites. \nI knew all the was nothing but to make people think you are christian. When push comes to shove you are right up there with the libertarian selfish crowd. \nYou probably really worship Magog Rhynn \nThe only way anybody is going to spend $400 a month on gasoline is if they are riding a motorcycle or simply have no job and nowhere to go and thus couldn\u2019t even afford that $400 a month. \nEven econo-boxes cost close to $60-$70 per full tank on 87 gas where I live. Nobody is going to fill up a car 6 times a month here if they are employed. Try double that. \nSame goes for a $1000 a month rent or mortgage. That will barely get you a single in the worst area of the city. \nOne person could not make it under those circumstances. A family of four can completely forget about it, unless they all live in the car and eat out of the 7-11 they park behind. Once you add in insurances, health coverage, car maintenance, etc. you\u2019d have to quadruple that $4000 figure for that size family to even pretend it was comfortable. And that\u2019s only if the $16K figure I mention is net. \nAmerica is a bad punchline now \u2013 nothing more. Newton \nIt\u2019s not even so much the actual people that really costs us all, but the incredibly innefective and almost inexhaustive amount of bureaucratic \u201csupport\u201d personnel for all these\u201cprograms\u201d. \nI mean; if you; Michael want to \u201cfind a money trail\u201d\u2013 follow a single minority mother with 3 kids to 2 different \u201cguys\u201d living in a burb with mom and dad next door \u2013 I mean; it\u2019s amazing ! \nThese people have individual \u201ccaseworkers\u201d\u2013 you can\u2019t make this up !

Currently we have farmers making 60K and Senators making 160K \nI\u2019m betting \u2013 these roles are gonna change! joe \nAnd what about the government employment sector that overpays millions of lazy so-called workers to either do nothing all day or push meaningless government dripple. This article is a shill for the fat cat rich who are so greedy that they would take social security from people who earned it and benefits from people who truly need it. \nWe never hear about the lazy government union parasites in these type of articles because thats what the real parasites who run america want to keep going. \nEven when these government employees were \u201clayed off\u201d they got full pay and benefits and did not have to apply for unemployment like private sector. Always getting some special privilege including the right to a paycheck without working. This amounts to alot of money payed for nothing and far exceeds the amount anyone receiving government benefits gets. \nAre they to work or just fill space and stand around and look stupid. Most of these \u201cjobs\u201d are not necessary but work to keep the corrupt political machine going. \nGovernment employees are a lazy pack of overpayed,overprivileged spoiled brats who think everything in life should be handed to them on a silver platter. Yet not one word will be uttered against them by their elite masters while these same masters seek to make the lives of those forced onto government benefits more miserable. Another attempt at class warfare. tom singa \nthat can\u2019t get fired! James \nThe Hard Working American vs. The Government Parasite \u2013 that\u2019s a good one. Did it occur to you \u201chard working\u201d types that what you call \u201cwork\u201d is actually as chattel on a slave farm? The Indians would never have understood that a person must continually pay to live on the piece of ground they were born on. So to those of you who think you are more noble for working and the poor are despicable \u2013 i say its because of you that the system keeps functioning and so its on your head. If people all thought like me then the system would end tomorrow. But they don\u2019t \u2013 so those of you who support it \u2013 its your mess so you deal with it and i will take what I can, because no man has the right to demand payment of me to live on the land so I have to take steps to circumvent the crime of what most of the rest of you created and continue to support. And by the way \u2013 this disdain for the poor \u201cparasites\u201d is one more psyop your rich masters are running on you to divide the lower and middle classes. nowwthen \nI guess if you try hard enough you can justify your disdain for taking care of yourself. Just throw in some nonsense about \u201cThe Indians\u201d and paid work as slavery and all of a sudden you\u2019re smarter than any self-sufficient man or woman and entitled to what you take from them. Timothy Leary\u2019s dead genius now get off your fat and go to work. james \nLook up the term Sheeple on Wikipedia and learn about yourself. James \nSo, put otherwise \u2013 not only are those of you who have jobs fools \u2013 your also morally liable for keeping this mess going. Your not better than, but less than. I am all for taking care of my own needs \u2013 but they stole the land and put us in cages and its now illegal to do so. A person has to have satanic blood tickets to do any trade. I curse it and refuse to be a good little obedient slave. so yeah, i will take what they give until the rest of you come to your senses. And remember that disdain for those on the government \u201cdole\u201d will not serve you as your turn is coming. Pray your envious demographic has not demonized the poor by that point so that you are just put in a work camp. Mr. G \nYou are so right, James! WE really don\u2019t need so much labor to make the world run \u2013 and much of our labor goes to supporting people above us, who want want want. I live happily in a lifestyle from the 1930\u2019s. It is a very full life and I have a great many hobbies and interests which do not require constant outlays of money, though oddly others who do the same things spend constantly and don\u2019t actually DO the things too much anymore. \nI can live like this, why can\u2019t they? And if they want more, fine by me \u2013 but they ought to work like dogs to produce their plastic crap, not enslave the little people! Mr. G Jeremy \nLots of anger in these comments. My suggestion: just log off (I come about once per week), and your blood pressure will drop. starr \nIt just makes me sick knowing the economic disaster America is in. I\u2019m 53 years old have worked since i was 14. Unfortunately, the company i worked for 7 years went out of business, which put me on unemployment. Been on it for 8 months, and it\u2019s making me crazy not working. I have alot of skills, put in several applications but no job. The jobs are not there, our government is lying to us. They want to keep us under there control.

Aren\u2019t several southern conservative states among the top recipients of government aid for its citizens? Such states as Alabama and Mississippi have extremely high numbers of people on welfare. So, saying that this is a \u201cliberal\u201d problem is just being divisive. Please, keep objective in your reporting; it would lend more credibility to your articles, especially to those of us who are in the middle (like myself) or liberal (like Gary2), and not hard-core conservatives. Michael \nYes, it is true. There are people gaming the system all over the country. It just happens to be a little easier to do in very liberal areas such as Chicago. \nMichael \nEXCELLENT article. I was waiting for this one! Great job! Nex \nThis has been the case for years, just for the longest time no one wanted to notice it. We got hicks in Alabama who live off subsidies from cradle to grave and we got blacks in NY doing the same, just now when economy turned to (thank you mortgages for everyone), it all of the sudden became an issue. \nStop policing the world or conquer whoever we own money to. Or just default already and lets watch fly. Phoenix \nGreat, we\u2019ve seen the problem loud and clear. The solution however is here. This is for open minded free thinkers, those who can envision a different, better world. \nI like how you\u2019re talking solution-oriented instead of problem-oriented.

What an ignorant statement. tom singa \noh there you have it a cash based business running under the table not paying his fair share, can you please tell me the name of your lawn care, Id like to report it to the IRS Tim \nYes I hear that all of the time. But look at the populations of those countries, take Norway for example. Population ~5 million. the US ~311 million. And did you know that Norway is an oil country? Without their oil their economy would probably stagnate. You are comparing apples to oranges my friend and your argument about those countries being better is not looking at all of the factors. Oil country= $$$ Marcus \nWe spend less than we earn. Simple as that. Sweden is not an oil country! And we are not socialist, study our economy before ranting please! We are market driven economies with a strong governmental influence. Which is not a problem for most of us, since we consider the government to be our servants, while americans consider the government their enemy. \nSometimes it feels like America aimed for freedom and ended up with anarchy. And I don\u00b4t hate the USA, but I expected more from you. 20 years ago people in Europe dreamed of California, now they dream of The Emirates, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada. Benjik Cherenkov \nThis is retarded. Americans should only be so lucky as to have a higher standard of living, better health care for less, better education, more cultural events, more vacations days by at least double, and governments who weren\u2019t in the pockets of the corporations. Gosh what a terrible thing. All this and you get to vote in a parliamentary system where your views might actually be represented instead of co-opted by politicians owned lock, stock, and barrel by the corporate elites. \nAnyone who believes this stupid story deserves the crappy American life they get. Gary2 \nMichael\u2013are you listening..your libertarian is just that a dream. tom singa \nspoken like a true piss antt mooch Bob Marshall \nEuropean-style socialism \u201cis exactly what we need now. I am against market fundamentalism. I think this propaganda that government involvement is always bad has been very successful-but also very harmful to our society.\u201d George Soros. \nIf you are trying to defend this it is because you are in the 49 % without a doubt!!! tom singa \na true mooch! Mia \nTypical liberal!! Fox news is the the only channel that make sense and I`m glad I do not believe the fairytale of change the liberal leaders want us to believe. The American Dream is dying because of Marxism. Go ahead, nobody can change you anyway\u2026 go sit in your couch get all the free money you want from the govt. You don`t care if the hardworking taxpayers suffer because all you libs care is yourself. Lee \nDo you even know the ideology behind Marxism or the \u2018American Dream\u2019? When you find out, come back and explain how it has killed the American Dream. In fact, as a loyal follower of Fox, in your own words, explain the difference between a liberalism and conservitism. \nAs shown by your lack of knowledge, I will assume you did not attend college, but if you did how did you pay for it? Use Pell Grants? Student loans? \nSometimes think before you speak\u2026. TheFulishBastid \nSo let me get the logic straight. Most everyone on welfare, snap, medicaid are \u201cgaming\u201d the system. I can quit my job tomorrow, or better yet, be willfully fired. Apply for my \u201csocialist\u201d benefits, and voila, I\u2019m living the high life? Rollin\u2019 in my caddy, wakin\u2019 up at noon, heading down to the store and buying steaks for me and my girl, drinking and smoking to the wee hours of the morn, wake up at 1 in the afternoon and do it all over again, ad infinitum? WHERE DO I SIGN UP?!?! \nOr the other option, we get rid of the \u201cbenefits\u201d that these people are living off of and demand that these folks go get jobs that don\u2019t exist? \nI think you shouldn\u2019t quit your day job, though maybe you should go work in a soup kitchen one day and see how well these folks you are blaming for your woes are truly living. tom singa \nSong as your willing to live in a dump, or share a nice home wiht a few others doing he same thing. better yet you can even own that home and charge the \u201croomies\u201d rent in cash! JF \nI work in Los Angeles (I live 1 hour away-thank God) as a Parole Agent. Many parolees are claiming a mental health ailment (Depression, hearing voices) and then sign up and receive SSI. Usually just below $900.00 dollars per month (many receive \u201cback pay\u201d which can be several thousand $). They also receive housing rental assistance, and EBT food cards. They lounge around all day and then buy alcohol and drugs with the money. This does not include all of the other freeloaders (Hoodrats-girls, having multiple children, illegals etc) who receive the same freebies. Los Angeles is a total mess and California itself is the same. The collapse is gonna be hard, and I see many cities erupting in violence and bloody riots when this occurs. hora \nSSI 900$ you said? well I am 65 retired and disable and get 350$. Now for sure a systems will collapse and very soon. 750$ SS and SSI what I collect I was working and paid taxes. Now when collapse sure a lot will stop get any check free, only real disable and older will keep a own money for was paid for long time, and riot? well that will a end of DEM KKK Party. InYoFace \nGo back to Mexico you are part of the problem Anonymous \nI will say say this\u2026 $4000 per month is MORE than enough to support a family of 5 people. \nThe problem with most Americans is they are not savvy or frugal. They are poor at micro managing and quite honestly, many suffer from narcissism and addiction. \nMany Americans live their lives ignorant of how their tools work, such as; automobiles, home appliances, computers, clothing, their own bodies. \nIf a family of 5 cannot live off of $4000 per month, they might be terrible at management, likely spending heavily on things they do NOT need to survive. Buying in excess of expensive food, luxury items, luxury clothing and accessories, cigarettes, drugs, bars, new automobiles, automobiles with poor gas mileage. \nOf course many Americans are bred in the system to believe that they were not be socially accepted if they do not own new cars, new houses, new clothes, new appliances, worship sports teams\u2026 \nThe future of many Americans will likely end up as a giant temper tantrum, with riots\u2026 followed by scores of military hosing them down and telling them to \u201cshut the fuck up and deal with it.\u201d \nI\u2019m not going to judge people, but it\u2019s the truth, people need to micro manage their lives better, not be lazy and learn how to care for their bodies and their tools. tom singa \njust had a conversation about this, how to cut back, but they cant live without a $120+ cable bill a mo, their landline with internet access, two smart phones at almost 200 a mo, I explain to them even turning up the AC o 81 or 82 during the day and no lower than 78 at night will cut that bill some 40 or more a mo, (they cant sleep if its not set at 70 degrees, My gosh, and these people thing tthey are entitled tto get GOC help! and they do! Jan Honeycutt \nThe National Guard requires my husband to have internet access and we have to pay it out of pocket. I coupon constantly, my kids get clearance clothes that are cheaper than Walmart its worth the hunt. We have about 950 a month come in after taxes every other week before taxes 1400, we have honestly needed help before and deserved it, and couldn\u2019t get it. My husband had to have surgery to remove a tumor luckily it wasn\u2019t cancerous, but he was still out of work and our insurance left us with a 1,000 dollar copay. I was in the ICU at the time of his surgery complications from a heart condition, a UTI, and extreme IBS. He ended up going back to work early, we have medical bills coming in everyday despite paying for 2 insurances. Both of our children have asthma, I have several bad health problems, and our daughter has extreme IBS and GERD on top of her asthma. I worked everyday I would now it just isn\u2019t possible and I can\u2019t get a penny of the disability I paid in despite having a non working bladder, heart condition, and epilepsy, while I watch healthy people walk around on it for Fibromyalgia and I even know of one government moocher getting 800 a month because her daughter has dyslexia! On top of that most of these people have never worked or paid a penny into disability! Our daughter has dyslexia and I would rather not manipulate the system to use my daughter as a pay check, these people have no integrity. I will admit we do have to keep our air on 71 at night due to my heart condition if I get too hot my heart rate goes up but blood pressure plummets, I seriously doubt most of the people getting their bills paid have a real need to keep their air low though, they just know they can. My husband works at a factory but he has an education and he is a staff sergeant in the Guard but still we only gross a round 42,000 a yr and one time while he was on orders he didn\u2019t get paid until a week later because of the system being down, we had to use credit cards and ask family for money. My husband only gets 2 sick days a yr I was in the hospital over 10 days last yr. We desperately needed help and because my husband is home now his 3 tours of duty count for nothing and we could not get military aid. We sunk to the ultimate low of applying for food stamps just to get a through a few months and were denied. We get cut out the wazoo to support people who refuse to help themselves, and when we needed help the door was slammed in our face. Now we\u2019re drowning in more debt due to 401k loans and credit cards we had to use during the hard times we were also forced to refinance to an armed interest rate to get by, I really hope it is easy to refinance out of it as we were told, but I doubt it, and we had no choice. Our government is horribly flawed. What this article is saying is that 4,000 a month is before taxes not after if we got half of the taxes we pay monthly we would be fine. Ken Sack \nThe problem wouldn\u2019t exist if people lived by the letter and spirit (no freeies from the government)of the law: Thou shalt not steal. Max Power \nUnfortunately, most Americans would rather commit mass suicide than see a single high paid multi-generational government neopot lose their job or pension. \nIn the US, there are literally hundreds of thousands of people who have US citizenship \u2014 but who are banned from the workforce by law, statute and regulation. Each person in this situation costs the government at multiple levels millions of dollars. \nPossibly up to 5% of the US debt burden at all levels is exacerbated by this problem \u2014 and nepotism, favoritism and cronyism do the rest\u2026 \nAnyway, here is an example of a Canadian with US Citizenship but banned from any kind of employment due to their nationality. Max Power \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/Australian-marry-preg/ Brunot \nScandinavian countries can do ok with socialism because of their high functioning populace. They\u2019re smarter and have a better culture in terms of work ethic, norms about work, etc, on average. They also live in tiny homes and drive tiny cars to achieve some of this \u201cprosperity\u201d. They also don\u2019t have much military spending, which is why they were conquered in a few weeks the last time anyone tried. A uniform ethnic makeup has helped with cultural issues of socialism as well, though this is changing. \nThere is also something to be said for the way socialist programs are administered. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to beat us at that. \nThe fact is, before the 60\u2019s welfare state we had virtually no debt problem. That is a FACT. \nWe are not Trillions in debt because of free markets and lack of government programs. That is a ridiculous leap of logic. Buckaroo Banzai \nUm, also don\u2019t forget the fact that the Scandinavian countries have been pumping oil (and wealth) out of the North Sea for 30 years now. Norway, especially, is just unbelievably rich from North Sea oil. \nSocialism is real easy to manage when you are pumping stuff out of the ground for $10 and selling it for $100. The monumental bureaucratic waste kind of gets lost in the shuffle of endless free money. John \nSome good comments that ring true, Brunot. NO NATION is greater than the productivity of its citizens. No nation is more moral that the morality of its people. Any nation that believes (and thinks) otherwise is doomed to eventually fail. tom singa \nmy reply to them, for them to move to any socialist country they like, ge out go live off some other country and see how that works out for you TheFulishBastid \nlols, what? \nDidn\u2019t appreciate my logic, or just my comment on working a soup kitchen for a day? \nMaybe I should just take Gary2\u2019s approach and call you a ****",

The CSX train was parked on a track next to the main railroad line and was empty, according to South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, R.  In a briefing with reporters Sunday afternoon, Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, detailed what is known so far.  The Amtrak train, traveling on tracks owned and maintained by freight railway giant, CSX, was supposed to pass over the switch to continue on to the main line tracks, but instead was directed onto the pad-locked crossing into a portion of track known as \"siding\" which was occupied by a parked CSX train, Sumwalt said.  \"For whatever reason that switch was, as they say in the railroad industry, 'lined and locked,'\" he said. \"Which basically means it was aligned for the train coming this way to be diverted into the siding.\"  \"Key to this investigation [is] why that switch was lined that way,\" Sumwalt said.  He said investigators have recovered the front-facing video camera from the Amtrak train and that it has been sent to labs at NTSB headquarters in Washington, D.C., where it will be reviewed. The footage will be important because it can offer details about what happened in the minutes before the collision.  However, he added that investigators have been unable to recover the event data recorders from either train in part because of the extent of the damage.  Sumwalt said there was \". . . catastrophic damage to each of the locomotives,\" adding that the Amtrak locomotive \". . . was not recognizable at all.\"  Derrec Becker of the South Carolina Emergency Management Division said injuries from the crash included minor cuts and broken bones. Lexington County spokesman Harrison Cahill said passengers who were hurt were taken to local hospitals, but none had life-threatening injuries.  There were two leaks from the train, spilling an estimated 5,000 gallons of fuel, but there was \"no threat to the public at this time,\" Cahill said at a morning news conference. He later said that it was unclear from where the fuel had leaked.  It will take several months to determine the cause of the crash, Sumwalt said. But he added that he expected to have more details Monday. In addition to investigators from the NTSB, personnel from the Federal Railroad Administration, which oversees the safety of the nation's railroads are also at the site.  \"The Federal Railroad Administration Investigative team is on site to support to the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation,\" the U.S. Department of Transportation said in a statement. \"We are closely monitoring the situation and have been in contact with CSX and Amtrak as well as federal, state and local officials.\"  The Transportation Department said Secretary Elaine Chao also sent her senior adviser, Jim Ray, to the crash site.  \"It is important to understand the factors that contributed to this tragic accident and how all stakeholders can ensure a safe and reliable rail system going forward,\" the DOT statement said.  Sumwalt said NTSB investigators had heard, but not confirmed, reports that maintenance work was being performed on the signal system prior to Sunday's crash.  Officials from CSX said its personnel were on the scene assisting state and local authorities, but did not respond to questions about whether the collision could have been the result of a switch issue or if there had been other issues - including a signal outage - on that stretch of track.  Earlier in the day, Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson said that the signalling system was not operating, which is why trains were being directed through the corridor manually by CSX dispatchers.  Anderson said CSX owns and controls the Columbia Subdivision tracks where the crash occurred and is responsible for overseeing the dispatching of trains and signal systems.  \"They are in complete control of the track, the signaling, the switching - and in fact our train engineers and conductors as we move over their railroad are directed and in regular contact with the dispatch center at CSX,\" Anderson said, adding, \". . . the signals and particularly the switches are controlled by CSX.\"  He said he did not know the reason for the signal outage. Anderson said the Amtrak train would normally travel on the main line track, not the section of the track where the collision occurred.  \"As I said, control of which train is on which track is within the authority of the dispatcher and the host railroad that controls the switch,\" Anderson said.  Tom Allen, program manager for the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff, which oversees rail safety in the state, said the collision could have been the result of a switch issue that sent the Amtrak train away from the main track and toward the parked freight train. But he emphasized it will be up to federal investigators to determine the cause.  President Donald Trump offered his words of support and thanked first responders in a tweet sent Sunday morning.  This is the third crash involving an Amtrak train in less than three months. Last week, a special charter Amtrak train carrying GOP lawmakers to a retreat in West Virginia collided with a garbage truck. One person in the truck was killed in the crash in Crozet, Virginia. In December, an Amtrak train in Washington state derailed while crossing an overpass, spilling cars onto a busy highway and killing three people.  Federal investigators have not determined the cause of the earlier crashes; investigations can take months or even years, but the incidents are likely to raise concerns about the safety of the nation's rail system and focus more attention on the push to install a technology known as positive train control, an automatic braking system that federal safety officials say could have prevented hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries over the years.  Even though it is early in the investigation, Sumwalt was adamant about the benefits of positive train control, and how it could have factored into an incident like Sunday's.  \"An operational PTC system is designed to prevent this type of accident,\" he said. \"A fully operational positive train control system could have avoided this accident, and that's what it was designed to do.\"  Asked for a simple explanation of such a system, Sumwalt said it would automatically halt a train entering an occupied track.  \"If you have a red signal . . . and you go blasting through that signal, it will enforce that signal and [not] allow you to go through that signal,\" he said.  In a letter sent last month to railroad industry officials, Chao warned them that they are expected to meet the federal deadline to have the systems installed by the end of this year.  On Sunday, Amtrak's Anderson also emphasized that it was important for railroads to meet the Dec. 31 deadline to install PTC.  He did not know if it could have prevented Sunday's crash, but said the track components involved would likely have been covered under such a system.  \"Theoretically a well-run operable PTC system not only would cover speed, but would also cover switches and signals,\" he said. It's \". . . important that PTC be implemented by the end of the year and that we don't give any extensions.\"  Amtrak passenger Derek Pettaway said he woke with a jolt when the collision happened Sunday, suffering minor whiplash. He had taken shelter with other passengers at the nearby Pine Ridge Middle School, where authorities were providing medical care. \"No one was panicking. I think most people were asleep. I think people were more in shock,\" Pettaway said in an interview with CNN.  The White House press pool was told that President Trump had been briefed on the situation and was receiving regular updates. Other officials also offered statements of support. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said his \"prayers are with the families of those killed.\"  Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., said those who were affected were in his thoughts.  Heartbreaking news this morning. Roxanne and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to all those injured and to the loved ones of the two people who lost their life in this tragic accident.  Sumwalt said the Amtrak train contained seven passenger cars and one locomotive, while the CSX train contained two locomotives and 34 empty \"autorack\" cars, meant for transporting automobiles.  \"The expectation of course was that the Amtrak would be operating straight down\" the track, Sumwalt said.  ---  Luz Lazo and Alisa Tang contributed to this report.",

Mr Tusk said that once the regional votes had taken place, he will inform Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Any extra concessions given to Wallonia may mean other countries will want to look again at the deal, however.\u201d (The BBC\u2019s headline, then \u2014 \u201cEU-Canada trade deal: Belgians break Ceta deadlock\u201d \u2014 is quite irresponsible. As is\u2013 \nCETA: \u201cBelgium breaks Ceta deadlock\u201d [ EUObserver ]. Not quite: \nBelgium\u2019s political entities agreed to a declaration on Thursday (26 October), which gives their government a green light to sign Ceta, the EU-Canada trade pact. \nThe agreement was promptly sent to EU ambassadors in Brussels, to be discussed later in the afternoon. \nAfter a week of marathon negotiations, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said that Thursday\u2019s talks had calmed \u201coutstanding concerns\u201d. \nAs part of the trade-off, Belgium will ask the European Court of Justice to clarify the proposed investment court system, which was one of the most controversial elements of the trade deal. \nCeta was due to be signed off by EU leaders and Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. Trudeau cancelled the trip during the night as no agreement had been reached in Brussels. \nIt\u2019s not known when the summit will take place, or whether the Belgian go-ahead was the last hurdle. \nThe other 27 EU countries must first accept the Belgian deal. \nAt their meeting on Thursday, EU ambassadors will be accompanied by lawyers and representatives of the EU institutions, who will examine the legality and consequences of the text. \nThe Walloon parliament will vote on the agreement on Friday. \nStill, how do we slay these undead deals? The same thing happened with TPP. \nCETA: \u201cThe great CETA swindle\u201d [ Corporate Europe Observatory ]. \u201cThe latest PR move is a \u201cjoint interpretative declaration\u201d on the trade deal hammered out by Ottawa and Brussels and published by investigative journalist collective Correctiv last Friday. It is designed to alleviate public concerns but in fact does nothing to fix CETA\u2019s flaws. In September, Canada\u2019s Trade Minister, Chrystia Freeland, and her German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, had announced such a text to appease Social Democrats, trade unions and the wider public who fear that CETA would threaten public services, labour and environmental standards and undermine governments\u2019 right to regulate in the public interest. Several governments, notably Austria, had linked their \u2018yes\u2019 to CETA to the declaration. [But] According to environmental group Greenpeace, the declaration therefore has the \u2018legal weight of a holiday brochure\u2019.\u201d \nLegal experts have also warned that the declaration \u201ccould be misleading for non-lawyers, who might think that the Declaration will alter or override the CETA\u201d. But it does not change CETA\u2019s legal terms \u2013 and it is these terms which have raised concerns. As Canadian law Professor Gus van Harten explains: \u201cBased on principles of treaty interpretation, the CETA will be interpreted primarily according to the text of its relevant provisions\u2026. The Declaration would play a subsidiary role, if any, in this interpretative process.\u201d In other words, legally (and thus politically), the CETA text is far more important than the declaration \u2013 and the former could prevail over the latter in case of a conflictive interpretation. \nThe post then goes on to analyze the provisions of the declaration in detail, comparing them to the text. (Readers may remember that TPP advocates have made the same sort of claim for the TPP Preamble, which the text also over-rides . So, the Belgians are smart to get a court ruling on this. And we might also expect the adminsitration to use similar tactics to (the toothless distraction of) the CETA \u201cresolution\u201d in the upcoming attempt to pass the TPP. \n\u201cBelgian officials were discussing a working document aimed at addressing Wallonia\u2019s concerns on the trade deal. The document, published by Belgian state media RTBF, shows that Belgium is moving toward requesting additional safeguards for the agricultural sector \u2018in cases of market turbulence.\u2019 It also puts forward a number of requests regarding the investor court system, including \u2018progressing towards hiring judges on a permanent basis'\u201d [ Politico ].

As much as 10% of the public in many of these surveys was also undecided. By contrast, Sec.

And Sirota is a busy lad\u2013 \n\u201cHow Donald Trump Used Fine Print To Make It Harder To Sue Wall Street For Fraud\u201d [David Sirota, International Business Times ]. In Links this morning, but amplifying: \nAccording to hundreds of pages of court documents reviewed by International Business Times, Trump notched a victory for himself and the financial industry by convincing judges that his own fine print warnings meant he had not deceived investors when he lured them to bet \u2014 and ultimately lose \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars on one of his riskiest development projects. The real estate mogul known for his litigiousness helped Corporate America secure a ruling making it harder for investors to file lawsuits. Unlike his other past business moves that appeared to affect only Trump\u2019s business partners, vendors and customers, this Trump case helped set a court precedent that was soon codified into law. \nTrump, in essence, argued \u201cit\u2019s my nature\u201d: \nTrump did not explicitly challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that his prospectus contained misleading or inaccurate information. Instead, his lawyer argued that \u201cthe cautionary language in this prospectus was so complete, so repetitive, so obvious and so well designed\u201d that it could not have misled investors. The court concurred. \n\u201cLet\u2019s set aside Hillary Clinton as an individual and consider her as the perfection of a corrupt political system.

Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in \u2018contributions\u2019 and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds.\u201d Which is why Clinton\u2019s public promises on policy are meaningless; we don\u2019t know who her silent partners are. And that ties rather neatly into her incrementalism, which she frames as \u201cI don\u2019t want to promise what I can\u2019t deliver\u201d (but to whom were the promises really made?) More: \u201cCobble together a multi-million dollar private foundation, millions of dollars in speaking fees from big-money contributors, conflicts of interest, the secrecy of private email servers, pay-to-play schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the Department of Justice, and the inevitable result is a politics as usual money-harvesting machine that lays waste to the nation, supporters and critics alike.\u201d \nThe Voters \n\u201cThe Daily 202: College-educated white women are Hillary Clinton\u2019s firewall\u201d [ WaPo ]. \u201cIf the Republican nominee was anywhere close to Romney\u2019s 52 percent support level among this traditionally Republican-leaning constituency, he would likely win the election.\u201d From what I read on the Twitter \u2014 admittedly an idiosyncratic sample \u2014 Clinton\u2019s previous firewall feels like she used and abandoned them.

An explosion occurred on Tuesday as a welder worked on a gas cylinder in a beached oil tanker. The explosion rapidly became an inferno with many workers trapped in the ship.\u201d That is like a war, isn\u2019t it? From John Keegan\u2019s description, in The Price of Admiralty , of the battle of Jutland (\u201cthe last major battle fought primarily by battleships in world history\u201d): \nAlthough not a war between states: \nNasir Mansoor, deputy-general secretary of the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF), hit out at the absence of safety procedures at Gadani yesterday, saying the Indonesian ship\u2019s tanks had not been cleaned ahead of the scrapping starting. Moreover, Mansoor alleged the yard had just one ambulance, which was being actually used for transporting the officials\u2019 children to and from school. Mansoor said a total of 250 workers were working on the tanker when the explosion occurred. \n\u201cWe demand that a murder case be registered right away against the Ship Breakers\u2019 Association,\u201d he said, calling for Rs3m compensation for each of the dead victims\u2019 families. \nOf course, given the givens, the explosion and the deaths follow from over-capacity as the night the day. And it\u2019s not as if the conditions at Gadani weren\u2019t common knowledge among elites. I remember reading this article in The Atlantic in 2014, and here\u2019s an image from it: \nSo, in the beached tanker, ka-boom! Whenever you hear the word \u201caccident,\u201d think to yourself: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018accident\u2019?\u201d Oh, and there\u2019s this little detail: \nThe floating oil production tanker, ACES (IMO # 8021830), was sold to the Gadani shipbreaker by Jakarta-based PT Sinar Mentari Prima and was used in the Jabung Batanghari terminal owned by the Indonesian government company BPMIGAS and operated by PetroChina. The change of flag and name of the ship happened just weeks before it reached the beach of Gadani, which strongly point towards the use of a cash buyer for the sale of the end-of-life vessel. \nHmm.

Larabell Email \nSan Francisco: the home of Haight-Ashbury, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Pier 39; an icon of neoliberalism and left-wing policies, homosexual activism, and countercultural movements. It\u2019s also an incredibly expensive place to live that is becoming increasingly gentrified by young urban tech-sector workers. Now, a new revolution is coming to the City by the Bay: a fully automated \u201cgourmet\u201d fast-food restaurant opening at 680 Folsom Street in the SoMa neighborhood. \nYes, you read that right. Imagine walking into a \u201cfast-food\u201d restaurant and ordering a burger using a tablet at the counter. Your burger can have practically any combination of fresh toppings you want, a variety of seasonings, a nice toasted gourmet bun, and \u2014 get this \u2014 a custom blend of gourmet meat. Want beef and pork? No problem. How about beef and bison? Coming right up. You can even pick how lean or fatty you want the meat blend. No, this is not a fantasy: Momentum Machines of San Francisco has produced a burger-making machine that can crank out nearly 400 burgers per hour. It can do everything from grilling the patties, toasting the buns, loading on the toppings, and bagging the finished product all without human interaction. According to a Craigslist ad posted by the company, \u201cThis location will feature the world-premiere of our proprietary and remarkable new advances in technology that enable the automatic creation of impossibly delicious burgers at prices everyone can afford.\u201d The ad states that burgers \u201cwill be fresh-ground and grilled to order, served on toasted brioche, and accented by an infinitely personalizable variety of fresh produce, seasonings, and sauces.\u201d \nAccording to a 2014 Huffington Post article, Momentum Machines \u201cplans to sell its invention to restaurants and, eventually, open its own chain to sell gourmet burgers at fast-food prices by eliminating the cost of paying line cooks. This, the company\u2019s website claims, will \u2018democratize access to high quality food, making it available to the masses.\u2019\u201d \u201cOur device isn\u2019t meant to make employees more efficient,\u201d Momentum co-founder Alexandros Vardakostas told the website Xconomy in 2012, \u201cIt\u2019s meant to completely obviate them.\u201d \nWe are now at a crossroads in the relationship between technology and human labor. Machines are now so advanced that, according to some experts, they are likely to replace a substantial portion of human workers in the next 20 or 30 years. Consider this from a March 18 LA Times op-ed by Bryan Dean Wright: A viral video released in February showed Boston Dynamics\u2019 new bipedal robot, Atlas, performing human-like tasks: opening doors, tromping about in the snow, lifting and stacking boxes. Tech geeks cheered and Silicon Valley investors salivated at the potential end to human manual labor. Shortly thereafter, White House economists released a forecast that calculated more precisely whom Atlas and other forms of automation are going to put out of work. Most occupations that pay less than $20 an hour are likely to be, in the words of the report, \u201cautomated into obsolescence.\u201d In other words, the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution has found its first victims: blue-collar workers and the poor. The general response in working America is disbelief or outright denial. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that 80% of Americans think their job will still exist in 50 years, and only 11% of today\u2019s workers were worried about losing their job to automation. Some \u2014 like my former colleagues at the CIA \u2014 insist that their specialized skills and knowledge can\u2019t be replaced by artificial intelligence. That is, until they see plans for autonomous drones that don\u2019t require a human hand and automated imagery analysis that outperforms human eyes. Human workers of all stripes pound the table claiming desperately that they\u2019re irreplaceable. Bus drivers. Bartenders. Financial advisors. Speechwriters. Firefighters. Umpires. Even doctors and surgeons. Meanwhile, corporations and investors are spending billions \u2014 at least $8.5 billion last year on AI, and $1.8 billion on robots \u2014 toward making all those jobs replaceable. Why? Simply put, robots and computers don\u2019t need healthcare, pensions, vacation days or even salaries. \nSound scary? If what Wright writes is true, this could understandably be terrifying to many people. To get a deeper understanding of this issue, we\u2019ll take a look at the history of technology and human labor, the situation as it stands today, and what can be expected in the future. \nMan vs. Machine \nThe relationship between technology and human workers has always been a mixed bag. Technology has nearly always brought advancements in standards of living for the majority of people, but in doing so, some human labor has always been replaced by that technology. This displacement of labor has not always been a bad thing, as new technologies have often led to jobs being created elsewhere. Let\u2019s take a trip back through history and find out how increased mechanization has led to shifts in human employment, and what\u2019s different with our situation today. \nThe invention of the printing press in 1440 was an early technological game-changer for human labor. While scribes were made obsolete, new jobs sprang up almost overnight as people were needed to run print shops, and all the ancillary industries supporting book production. Furthermore, books, while still expensive by today\u2019s standards, were within reach of the common man, whereas before, the hand-copied manuscripts were prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthy. \nThe next great technological advancement that led to massive shifts in human employment was in the realm of agriculture. Strictly speaking, the very first technological advancements in agriculture involved the use of animal labor, such as horses or teams of oxen used for plowing fields or turning mills, and this freed humans from backbreaking, unpleasant work. But as agriculture became more mechanized in the 19th and 20th centuries, animal labor was displaced, and increased efficiency meant fewer people were needed on farms. In the 1800s, for instance, over 80 percent of Americans worked on farms in some capacity. Today, less than two percent of Americans work on farms. This massive shift in human capital, of course, was absorbed by the growing industrial and service economy. \nAlong with the shift in agriculture came a technological revolution in the textile industry. The industrial revolution saw the rise of power looms and other equipment that obviated much of the human labor involved in textile manufacture. In England, this led to an uprising of displaced textile workers known as Luddites, hence the pejorative \u201cLuddite\u201d for someone in modern times who resists technological or other forms of societal advancement. The Luddites went so far as to destroy those very machines that took their jobs. Of course, industrialization opened up many new jobs for people, and the Luddites\u2019 fears were largely unfounded. As an aside, there are almost no textile mills in Western countries anymore; they\u2019ve all moved to poorer nations, mainly in Central America or Southeast Asia. \nBy and large, industrialization and its attendant advances in technology have always provided more employment and raised people\u2019s standards of living, not the other way around. But is this about to change? Many fear that we are entering an era when technology has advanced to the point where machines are capable of doing so many tasks that are currently done by humans that there won\u2019t be any \u201cother jobs\u201d for people to do. And what about building and servicing these machines? Again, most of that could soon be done by other machines , or a small number of very specialized human workers. \nAmy Webb, a digital media futurist and founder of Webbmedia Group, predicts at least eight career fields are \u201cripe for disruption\u201d very soon \u2014 most likely in the next 10 to 20 years. She points to toll booth operators and cashiers, marketers, phone-based customer service, factory workers, financial middlemen, journalists, non-litigation lawyers, and telephone installation/maintenance workers as jobs that could be phased out soon. \nUniversity of Oxford researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne estimated in 2013 that 47 percent of total U.S. jobs could be automated and taken over by computers by 2035. Said a March 24, 2015 article for Tech Times regarding this prediction: If you want to stay employed by then, you better think about a career shift into software development, higher level management or the information sector. Those professions are only at a 10 percent risk of replacement by robots, according to Osborne. By contrast, lower-skilled jobs in the accommodation and food service industries are at a 87 percent risk, transportation and warehousing are at a 75 percent risk and real estate at 67 percent. The researcher warns that driverless cars, burger-flipping robots and other automatons taking over low-skilled jobs is the way of the future. \nThere\u2019s potentially a real problem on the horizon. Let\u2019s take a more detailed look at what economists and tech experts say about the types of jobs that will be replaced, or are already being replaced, by machines. \nBlue-collar Blues \nBlue-collar, manual-labor jobs are obvious candidates for being replaced by machines in the near future. In fact, this has already happened to some extent, as robots have been used in assembly lines (think automotive manufacturing) for a few decades. But as the capability of such industrial robots increases, so will their ability to replace more and more human laborers. \nAs we noted above, fast-food workers will most definitely be some of those whose jobs are on the chopping block. As noted in the U.K. Mirror on May 25: A former McDonald\u2019s CEO warned that robots will take over staff jobs at the fast food empire \u2014 because it\u2019s cheaper than employing humans. Ed Rensi has said that buying highly skilled robotics is a cheaper alternative than employing people on minimum wage to work in the company\u2019s worldwide restaurants. He warned that huge job losses are imminent, and commented that it would be \u201ccommon sense\u201d to replace humans in the workplace.... Rensi said: \u201cI was at the National Restaurant Show yesterday [and looked] at the robotic devices that are coming into the restaurant industry. It\u2019s cheaper to buy a $35,000 (\u00a324,000) robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who\u2019s inefficient making $15 (\u00a310.20) an hour bagging French fries. [A $15 minimum wage is] nonsense and it\u2019s very destructive and it\u2019s inflationary and it\u2019s going to cause a job loss across in this country like you\u2019re not going to believe.\u201d He told FOX: \u201cIt\u2019s not just going to be in the fast food business. Franchising is the best business model in the United States. It\u2019s dependent on people that have low job skills that have to grow. Well if you can\u2019t get people [at] a reasonable wage, you\u2019re going to get machines to do the work. It\u2019s just common sense. It\u2019s going to happen whether you like it or not. And the more you push this it\u2019s going to happen faster.\u201d \nAlong with service-sector jobs, manufacturing jobs will be among the hardest hit by the coming robot revolution. Again, these are mostly repetitive, low-skill labor jobs that lend themselves well to mechanization. In Chinese factories, robots are currently being brought in to replace human workers who are seeking higher wages. At a production line based in Guangdong province for German optical system manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, robots are being used for applying protective films, cutting, polishing, and packaging \u2014 jobs that used to be performed by humans. What\u2019s happening at the Carl Zeiss factory is illustrative of a larger trend in China. As MIT Technology Review observed April 26: Countless manufacturers in China are planning to transform their production processes using robotics and automation at an unprecedented scale. In some ways, they don\u2019t really have a choice. Human labor in China is no longer as cheap as it once was, especially compared with labor in rival manufacturing hubs growing quickly in Asia. In Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, factory wages can be less than a third of what they are in the urban centers of China. One solution, many manufacturers \u2014 and government officials \u2014 believe, is to replace human workers with machines.... The goal is to overtake Germany, Japan, and the United States in terms of manufacturing sophistication by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. To make that happen, the government needs Chinese manufacturers to adopt robots by the millions. It also wants Chinese companies to start producing more of these robots. \nTo ship all those robot-made Chinese products to the United States requires cargo ships and dockworkers at both ends. What about those jobs? Well, they\u2019re being replaced by machines, too. For instance, at TraPac LLC\u2019s shipping terminal in Los Angeles, dozens of robots move shipping containers about, setting them in precise spots with little need for human interaction. Despite strong opposition from longshoremen\u2019s unions, other U.S. ports may soon follow TracPac\u2019s example and become more automated, as many overseas ports have already done. \nRobots are already being used to provide greater efficiency in warehouses. Amazon uses its Kiva Systems robots (to which the Internet retail giant has exclusive rights), and Locus Robotics has created a warehouse order-picking robot that it says is superior to Kiva\u2019s. In a warehouse in Devens, Massachusetts, owned by Quiet Logistics, Locus robots silently zip around a warehouse bigger than six football fields, transporting orders 24 hours a day with no need for lunch breaks, vacations, or a paycheck. \u201cWe developed a system where the robots do all the walking,\u201d Locus Robotics CEO Bruce Welty told Tech Insider in February. \u201cAs retailers continue to exceed expectation around next-day shipping, they\u2019re going to look to technology to help them provide an even faster turn-around,\u201d Welty said. In some warehouse applications, Quiet Logistics being one of them, robots won\u2019t replace any human jobs \u2014 yet . But one could imagine that as fewer humans are needed, fewer will be hired. \nSome say that within a decade or two we could see fleets of driverless trucks on the road, guided by GPS navigation and onboard radar. Big companies are eager to streamline their shipping operations by cutting down on hours lost owing to human drivers, and are spending big money on R&D in the hope to ship their products using self-driving trucks. Take Walmart, for example. The retail giant is already developing \u201csemi-autonomous\u201d trucks that are mostly self-driving, only requiring a human driver to take the reins in heavy traffic or inclement weather. Semi-autonomous or even fully autonomous trucks are also being sought to mitigate a shortage of human truck drivers on the horizon. \nIn addition to driverless trucks, a future with electric-powered, self-driving cars functioning as \u201ctaxis\u201d for people is not far from reality. In fact, the \u201cbig three\u201d Detroit automakers (GM, Chrysler, and Ford) are already rolling out self-driving cars, or \u201cautonomous vehicles\u201d (AVs) in limited markets for testing. All plan to have fully autonomous cars by 2020 or 2021. And the Europeans aren\u2019t being left in the dust: Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes are all developing AV lines of their own. \nAssuming any bugs and safety issues can be worked out, will there even be a market for such vehicles in the near future? There already is. Ride-hailing service Uber is currently offering self-driving cars in certain markets as part of a pilot program, with the goal to eventually axe all of its drivers in favor of AVs. Young entrepreneurial Uber drivers will probably not be too excited about that, but such is life. And Uber\u2019s main competitor in the United States, San Francisco-based Lyft, plans to use self-driving cars for the majority of its rides within five years. To start with, such self-driving taxis will only operate at speeds up to 25 miles per hour in limited areas, and won\u2019t operate in bad weather. That is, until the technology improves enough to allow them to operate in all conditions at higher speeds. Lyft co-founder John Zimmer believes that personal car ownership, at least for city dwellers, will come to an end as using AV \u201ctaxis\u201d quickly becomes a less-costly alternative to owning a vehicle. \nWhite-collar Woes \nIt\u2019s not just blue-collar jobs that are being threatened. As Business Insider noted in May of 2015, \u201cArtificial intelligence and robots are not just challenging blue-collar jobs; they are starting to take over white-collar professions as well. Financial and sports reporters, online marketers, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and financial analysts are already in danger of being replaced by robots.\u201d And as a March 16 article for Christian Science Monitor noted: If you think being a \u201cprofessional\u201d makes your job safe, think again. The two sectors of the economy harboring the most professionals \u2014 healthcare and education \u2014 are under increasing pressure to cut costs. And expert machines are poised to take over. We\u2019re on the verge of a wave of mobile apps for measuring everything from your cholesterol to your blood pressure, along with diagnostic software that tells you what it means and what to do about it. In coming years, software apps will be doing many of the things physicians, nurses, and technicians now do (think ultrasound, CT scans, and electrocardiograms). Meanwhile, the jobs of many teachers and university professors will disappear, replaced by online courses and interactive online textbooks. \nLeigh Watson Healy, chief analyst at market research firm Outsell, has this to say about the capability of machines to make market predictions as financial advisors: \u201cNow with machine algorithms and big data disrupting, stock and equity analysts will have to figure out what their value ad is going to be.\u201d The fact of the matter is, machines are able to process so much data so quickly that they could theoretically make market predictions much better than human advisors. Particularly for many younger clients or others with simple investment needs, robo-advisors could very well be the wave of the future. \nRegarding legal jobs, as noted in a 2015 Fortune article, new software systems \u201cuse syntactic analysis and keyword recognition to comb through emails, texts, databases, and scanned documents to find those that one party in a lawsuit would be obliged to turn over to the other through the legal discovery process.\u201d This, conceivably, could replace associates and paralegals in law firms. \nWith such legal jobs being threatened, it should come as no surprise that writing and research jobs are also in danger of being automated. The Internet wiped out countless newspapers, and new technology could kill even more journalism positions. The next innovation will be algorithms that allow news outlets to automatically create stories and place them on websites without human interaction. Robot journalists are already writing thousands of articles a quarter at the Associated Press. And it should come as no surprise that machines have the potential to be better researchers than humans, provided they are given the correct search parameters. The speed at which they are able to access data and the fact that they don\u2019t get tired make them ideal researchers. \nBut what about the medical field? Surely this requires a great deal of hands-on, human-controlled interactions. Not so fast: Robots are already used in surgeries, and are able to perform operations with greater precision than human surgeons. A human surgeon controls the robot remotely, and in this way can \u201camplify\u201d his or her surgical ability. According to the above-mentioned article in Fortune : Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Sedasys system, already FDA approved, can automate delivery of low-level anesthesia in applications like colonoscopies at [a] fraction of the cost of a dedicated anesthesiologist. A doctor can supervise multiple machines at the same time to keep the human element. IBM\u2019s Watson, well known for its stellar performance in the TV game show Jeopardy! , has already demonstrated a far more accurate diagnosis rate for lung cancers than humans \u2014 90 percent versus 50 percent in some tests. The reason is data. Keeping pace with the release of medical data could take doctors 160 hours a week, so doctors can\u2019t possibly review the amount of new insights or even bodies of clinical evidence that can give an edge in making a diagnosis. \nPharmacists aren\u2019t safe either. As Business Insider noted in 2012, The [University of California, San Francisco] Medical Center recently launched an automated, robotics-controlled pharmacy at two UCSF hospitals. Once computers at the new pharmacy electronically receive medication orders from UCSF physicians and pharmacists, the robotics pick, package, and dispense individual doses of pills. Machines assemble doses onto a thin plastic ring that contains all the medications for a patient for a 12-hour period, which is bar-coded. The pharmacy system, which was phased in over the past year, so far has prepared 350,000 doses of medication without error. \nThis is not to suggest robots will take all jobs. There will still be a number of things that robots will not be able to do as well as humans. For instance, jobs requiring creativity, \u201cpeople skills,\u201d or human interaction will likely stay with human employees. Nurses, managers, salespeople, entrepreneurs, and artists come to mind. Unfortunately, politicians won\u2019t be done away with. \nIn truth, jobs will likely align themselves around several loci. There will be demand for hands-on, \u201ccaregiver\u201d type jobs such as nurses, nursing home caregivers, physical therapists, massage therapists, etc. There will be opportunities for \u201ccreative\u201d jobs such as artists, musicians, entertainers, athletes, fiction writers, public speakers, and the like. \u201cManagerial\u201d jobs such as C-level corporate jobs and politicians will exist. Finally, \u201ctech\u201d jobs such as programmers, web developers, and software engineers will obviously be in demand. \nWhat Does It All Mean? \nSo what will this Brave New World look like when machines do most of our work for us, and humans are needed for very few jobs? How will people even be able to buy all of the goods and services produced by these robot workers if they don\u2019t have jobs to begin with? Naturally, many economists and futurists are suggesting that government will be the solution. \nThere have been talks of having government give every adult person a \u201cbasic income\u201d regardless of their employment status or current income level. Some have suggested giving people a paycheck of more than $2,000 per month, just for being human. And where would this money come from? Why, the rich folks who own the companies that either produce or \u201cemploy\u201d the machines that took the people\u2019s jobs, of course. Since, as the argument goes, money will be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands if companies no longer have to employ people, those who benefit from this arrangement should support those who have been displaced. \nSome European countries have actually toyed with the idea over the last few decades, with Switzerland actually having a referendum on the issue in June. Under the proposed scheme of a Basic Income Guarantee (BIG), all Swiss adults would have received a monthly check of 2,500 Swiss francs, or slightly over $2,500. Children would have received 625 francs per month. The fiscally conservative Swiss roundly rejected the idea, with nearly 80 percent voting against a BIG. As Charles Wyplosz, an economics professor at the Geneva Graduate Institute, remarked, \u201cIf you pay people to do nothing, they will do nothing.\u201d Member of Parliament Luzi Stamm of the Swiss People\u2019s Party voiced another concern: \u201cTheoretically, if Switzerland were an island, the answer is yes. But with open borders, it\u2019s a total impossibility, especially for Switzerland, with a high living standard.... If you would offer every individual a Swiss amount of money, you would have billions of people who would try to move into Switzerland.\u201d But proponents of the idea aren\u2019t giving up: They\u2019ve vowed to keep pressing the issue, and keep having referendums, until it becomes a reality. The Dutch city of Utrecht, on the other hand, is experimenting with a basic income among its current welfare recipients. One-third of the recipients will receive welfare as currently administered, one-third will receive the welfare albeit with different rules, and the remaining third will simply receive a $1,000 check every month whether or not they even attempt to find a job. And Finland will conduct its own experiment in 2017, with 180,000 Finns set to receive a basic income of 500 to 700 euros a month. \nThe idea of a guaranteed basic income is nothing new. In fact, it has been proposed by progressives for more than a century. Martin Luther King, Jr. even suggested that some form of basic income would eliminate poverty. Bill Gross of Janus Capital Group wrote for the Wall Street Journal in May, \u201cMillions of jobs will be lost over the next 10-15 years,\u201d and that the usual solutions to this problem won\u2019t work anymore. \u201cFour years of college for everyone might better prepare them to be a contestant on Jeopardy , but I doubt it\u2019ll create more growth,\u201d Gross contends. The former bond king recommends a \u201cUniversal Basic Income.\u201d Gross points out that welfare already exists in other forms, such as food stamps and the earned-income tax credit. \u201cIf more and more workers are going to be displaced by robots, then they will need money to live on, will they not? And if that strikes you as a form of socialism, I would suggest we get used to it,\u201d he said. Gross says it\u2019s not a matter of \u201cif,\u201d but \u201cwhen,\u201d and the way to pay for it is, in his words, \u201chelicopter money.\u201d Yep, that\u2019s right: Have central banks crank up the printing presses and start creating money to give to people, no strings attached. \nLet\u2019s move into the realm of the hypothetical here and imagine an entire world where, say, 95 percent of the population is supported by a government income. Even if more than five percent of the populace could find employment, there would be little incentive to do so. People would demand that government provide for their very existence. Government-provided food, entertainment, housing, income, etc. would be akin to the Roman policy of \u201cbread and circuses\u201d for the poor. The glaring problem with this is the fact that government will effectively be a parent who controls everyone\u2019s life. The old adage, \u201cHe who pays the piper calls the tune\u201d comes to mind. A society where a wealthy, property-owning, technocratic elite supports and cares for the masses would necessitate those elites \u201cmanaging\u201d society and the masses. After all, the masses would effectively become the \u201cproperty\u201d of the elite. Bearing that in mind, such \u201cmanagement\u201d would undoubtedly include management of the world\u2019s human population. \nGovernment-supplied \u201cfree\u201d contraceptives and abortions (heavily promoted by media and public schools, of course), adding sterilants to the municipal water supply or infertility-causing substances to food and/or vaccines, and even controlling the birth rate by fiat as in Communist China, have all been suggested as ways to limit, and reduce, world population. Far-fetched? Perhaps, but one must admit that much of this is not outside the realm of possibility. \nBut what might happen if government did not get involved (as difficult as that might be to imagine)? A truly free market would find ways to keep people employed. More precisely, people themselves, acting out of their own rational self-interest, would find ways to get by, whether this means working as an employee at a \u201cjob\u201d or something else entirely. Realistically, many people could revert back to being entrepreneurs producing small quantities of artisan, hand-made items such as crafts, tools, artwork, food, beer, clothing, etc. People could either pay or barter for such items. Such \u201cniche\u201d businesses already exist, to be sure, but more could flourish under an economy where machines do most of the mundane jobs for large employers that people currently perform now. Indeed, people could return to the days of being more self-reliant, growing their own food in either private or communal gardens and raising small livestock, and bartering for items they don\u2019t produce themselves. \nIf, for the sake of argument, half of all jobs in America were taken by machines, many people might choose to return to single-income households, with one parent (typically the mother) staying home to raise the kids. In this scenario, becoming more self-reliant and producing artisan goods for sale or barter would certainly help to make ends meet, especially since inflation has made it very difficult for most American families to live comfortably on one income. Plus, having a parent stay at home would offer many families the opportunity to homeschool their children and give children experience in producing homemade crafts and goods. Education is becoming increasingly Internet-based anyway, so keeping kids at home would not prevent them from having excellent educational opportunities. Of course, owing to the breakup of the \u201cnuclear family\u201d in America, many households are already single-income because they are single-parent. Such situations would be difficult in a world of reduced human employment. But again, if people are allowed the freedom to act in their own rational self-interest, they will find ways to make it work. Human creativity knows no bounds, and when government planners step out of the way and let people follow their desires and creativity, who can foresee what amazing new products, inventions, and jobs might emerge? And truly, this was the desire of the Founding Fathers of our Republic: to have a nation where a self-reliant people were free to use their creativity to pursue their own interests and desires. Such an attitude is illustrated in a letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, written May 12, 1780: I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have liberty to study Painting and Poetry Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Mathematicks and Philosophy, Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their Children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry and Porcelaine. \nSo what will the future bring after the rise of the robots? The answer, really, depends upon whether or not government interferes. If people are allowed to use their own ingenuity and creativity, society and humanity in general could flourish, and indeed enter a true \u201cgolden age\u201d of civilization. Or we could see the masses reduced to absolute servitude beneath a technocratic elite who control every aspect of human life. Sadly, if our current trajectory is not changed, the latter scenario seems most likely. This underscores the need to restore and preserve our American system of constitutional limited government; humanity\u2019s future literally hangs in the balance. \n\nThis article is an example of the exclusive content that's available by subscribing to our print magazine.

( Amtrak train cars lie on Interstate 5 after a derailment in DuPont, Washington, on Dec. 18, 2017. ( Photo: Bloomberg Photo By David Ryder) Fatal Amtrak crashes spotlight 10-year wait for safety upgrades 1 / 1 Back to Gallery  The third fatal Amtrak crash in less than two months has thrown a spotlight on delays in installing congressionally mandated technology designed to slow trains automatically and prevent collisions.  In the most recent episode, work to install the new system, known as Positive Train Control, might itself have contributed to the crash outside Columbia, South Carolina, on Sunday, federal officials said. Employees had temporarily lowered the safety protections on the set of tracks where an Amtrak train en route from New York to Miami rammed into a parked CSX Corp. freight train.  Two Amtrak employees died and more than 100 people were hurt.  The collision would not have occurred if a PTC system had been functioning there, said Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB said the same thing after an Amtrak train derailed Dec. 18 near DuPont, Washington, when an engineer failed to slow down for a curve, killing three people. PTC would have sensed where the train was and automatically slowed before it reached the curve.  \"People are dying,\" Rep. Sean Maloney, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"We can't wait any longer on getting PTC systems up and running nationwide. Congress has delayed this deadline time and again and we've seen the deadly results.\"  Local Channel Now Playing: Now Playing Video: Motorcyclist leads high-speed chase in San Antonio area, cruises through collision scene San Antonio Express-News  Teen accused of fatally stabbing neighbors gave interview before arrest San Antonio Express-News  Slaying suspect proclaims innocence while being taken to jail San Antonio Express-News  Attempted drug deal ends in stabbing at S.A. bar San Antonio Express-News  Body found near S.A. shopping center San Antonio Express-News  Suspects arrested after 10-hour standoff Brandpoint  Police surround San Antonio motel after 2 barricade themselves inside San Antonio Express-News  1 dead in shooting after fight at S.A. home San Antonio Express-News  Woman guilty of killing trucking tycoon husband wants new trial San Antonio Express-News  Texas Mom Gets 20 Years After Hot Car Deaths of Children She Locked Inside to Teach a 'Lesson' People  Despite the NTSB's decades-long recommendations for PTC, and Congress in 2008 mandating it by 2015 on critical sections of track, many railroads are still years away from completion. In late 2015, when it became clear that railroads wouldn't meet the deadline, lawmakers extended it until this year. If railroads install PTC equipment across their systems and get it operational on at least half of their lines, they can take another two years to complete the task.  The other fatal Amtrak crash occurred last Wednesday in Virginia when a train carrying Republican lawmakers struck a trash truck driving through a grade crossing. An occupant of the truck died. The PTC systems mandated by Congress can't detect vehicles at a grade crossing, so it wouldn't have prevented that accident. However, some similar systems do monitor grade crossings, like along a section of Amtrak rail in Michigan.  PTC was also raised as an issue Tuesday at an NTSB meeting to conclude investigations into two New York-area transit system accidents. Within 13 weeks in late 2016 and last year, trains operated by New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road slammed into posts at the end of rail lines after engineers failed to stop. The crashes killed one and injured more than 200.  Because of PTC's limitations, neither transit system could use the safety system within the stations, so it would have been unable to prevent either accident if it had been installed. The NTSB issued a recommendation calling on U.S. regulators to develop another automatic system that works in stations.  U.S. Federal Railroad Administration data shows that railroads carrying people have on average lagged far behind freight systems in installing PTC.  Amtrak is an exception and has almost completed its installation, according to FRA data. However, most U.S. rail transit systems are lagging, according to FRA. New Jersey Transit, for example, had completed installing just seven percent of required PTC hardware through the end of September.  Overall, passenger lines are operating PTC on 24 percent of their route miles, compared to 45 percent for freight systems.  Railroads have encountered many technical hurdles that made implementing PTC more complex than first thought, according to the Association of American Railroads, an industry trade group. Companies must equip locomotives with PTC technology, install thousands of wayside signals and communications towers as well as build up the network of computer servers to make the system work, each with its own set of challenges.  CSX, which owns the track where Sunday's crash occurred, declined to comment on the NTSB account, other than to say that it was cooperating with the investigation.  The Amtrak train was diverted from the main railroad track to a side area where the CSX freight train had been parked. The switch connecting the main line to the side area hadn't been returned to its normal position after the freight train entered the area, according to the NTSB.  Before the NTSB briefing on Monday, Bryan Tucker, a spokesman for CSX, said that the railroad was on schedule to meet the 2018 deadline for installation of PTC and to have the system fully operational by 2020.  As the railroad performed maintenance to install PTC in the South Carolina stretch of track, workers disabled signals that normally warn train engineers of hazardous conditions.  Such operations are permitted so long as an engineer gets permission to operate from a railroad dispatcher, Sumwalt said.  He declined to say what CSX workers have told investigators about what allowed the switch to remain in the wrong position and what the Amtrak train's dispatcher, who was also a CSX employee, was told about the status of the track.  Freight railroads have completed installation of PTC on 56 percent of required rail sections, according to the AAR. Commuter rail systems are not included in the totals. Amtrak has finished the work on track it owns between Boston and Washington.  Implementing the system has taken railroads longer than expected, according to Tom Schnautz, an assistant vice president of Norfolk Southern Corp. He said his railroad had planned to install track-side monitoring systems and radio antennas concurrently but had to halt antenna installations for a year because of lengthy regulatory reviews it had not anticipated at the outset.  \"We continued with the installations of wayside locations and left the antennas laying on the ground and had to come back later,\" said Schnautz, who co-chairs a PTC committee at the AAR. \"That was a very significant issue at that point.\"  The cost of the system is expected to exceed $13 billion just through this year, according to the AAR.  Railroads have at times been their own worst enemy developing PTC, said Steven Ditmeyer, a former official at the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration who teaches rail management at the University of Delaware.  PTC uses global-positioning satellite technology and track sensors to monitor every train's location and can automatically slow or stop a train if there's a speed restriction or obstruction ahead. It can also be a huge efficiency boon, allowing trains to operate closer together and speeding arrivals, according to Ditmeyer and a 2004 Federal Railroad Administration study.  Railroads could save from $937 million to $2.1 billion a year with PTC, the study found.  \"Most of the railroads have ignored the business benefits that can derive from this technology,\" Ditmeyer said. That has, in turn, created incentives that have slowed its introduction, he said.  \"It's implementation and its integration has been far more difficult than they imagined,\" said Peter Goelz, the former managing director at NTSB who is now a lobbyist at O'Neill & Associates in Washington. \"But that's not to say that some of the railroads weren't dragging their feet at the onset.\"  Whether the latest accidents will push PTC into operation sooner is an open question.  Augustine Ubaldi, an engineer at Robson Forensic Inc. in Ohio who has worked on large railroad infrastructure projects, predicted there will be growing pressure by lawmakers to install the system. But it would be a mistake to move simply for political reasons, Ubaldi added.  The complexities that have delayed its installation are legitimate and railroads should be allowed to use simpler technology, he said. In addition, Positive Train Control won't prevent some railroad accidents, like derailments because of defective tracks.  \"I don't want people to think it's a magic bullet and we won't ever have enough another train derailment as soon as PTC goes into service,\" Ubaldi said.  --With assistance from Thomas Black",

                              "text": "Rail Traffic Depression: 292 Union Pacific Engines Are Sitting In The Arizona Desert Doing Nothing   May 4th, 2016 \nWe continue to get more evidence that the U.S. economy has entered a major downturn. Just last week, I wrote about how U.S. GDP growth numbers have been declining for three quarters in a row , and previously I wrote about how corporate defaults have surged to their highest level since the last financial crisis . Well, now we are getting some very depressing numbers from the rail industry. As you will see below, U.S. rail traffic was down more than 11 percent from a year ago in April. That is an absolutely catastrophic number, and the U.S. rail industry is feeling an enormous amount of pain right now. This also tells us that \u201cthe real economy\u201d is really slowing down, because less stuff is being shipped by rail all over the nation. \nOne of the economic commentators that I have really come to respect is Wolf Richter of WolfStreet.com . He has a really sharp eye for   in the economy and in the financial world, and I find myself quoting him more and more as time goes by. If you have not checked out his site yet, I very much encourage you to do so. \nOn Wednesday, he posted a very alarming article about what is happening to our rail industry. The kinds of numbers that we have been seeing recently are the kinds of numbers that we would expect if an economic depression was starting. The following is an excerpt from that article \u2026 \nTotal US rail traffic in April plunged 11.8% from a year ago, the Association of American Railroads reported today. Carloads of bulk commodities such as coal, oil, grains, and chemicals plummeted 16.1% to 944,339 units. \nThe coal industry is in a horrible condition and cannot compete with US natural gas at current prices. Coal-fired power plants are being retired. Demand for steam coal is plunging. Major US coal miners \u2013 even the largest one \u2013 are now bankrupt. So in April, carloads of coal plummeted 40% from the already beaten-down levels a year ago. \nBecause rail traffic is down so dramatically, many operators have large numbers of engines that are just sitting around collecting dust. In his article, Wolf Richter shared photographs from Google Earth that show some of the 292 Union Pacific engines that are sitting in the middle of the Arizona desert doing absolutely nothing. The following is one of those photographs\u2026 \nAs Wolf Richter pointed out, it costs a lot of money for these engines to just sit there doing nothing\u2026 \nThese engines are expensive pieces of equipment. When they just sit there, not pulling trains, they become \u201covercapacity,\u201d and they get very expensive. Then there are engineers and other personnel who suddenly become unproductive. Some of them have already been laid off or are getting laid off. \nAll over the world, similar numbers are coming in. For example, the Baltic Dry Index fell 30 more points on Wednesday after falling 21 on Tuesday. Global trade is really, really slowing down during the early portion of 2016. What this means on a practical level is that a lot less stuff is being bought, sold and shipped around the planet. \nIt is becoming increasingly difficult for authorities to deny that a new global recession has begun, and at this moment we are only in the very early chapters of this new crisis. \nAnother thing that I watch very closely is the velocity of money. When an economy is healthy, people feel pretty good about things and money tends to circulate fairly rapidly. For example, I may buy something from you, then you may buy something from someone else, etc. \nBut when times get tough, people tend to hold on to their money more tightly, and that is why the velocity of money goes down when recessions hit. In the chart below, the shaded areas represent recessions, and you can see that the velocity of money has declined during every single recession in the post-World War II era\u2026 \nDuring the last recession, the velocity of money declined precipitously, and that makes perfect sense. But then a funny thing happened. There was a slight bump up once the recession was over, but then it turned down again and it has kept going down ever since. \nIn fact, the velocity of money has now dropped to an all-time low. The velocity of M2 just recently dipped below 1.5 for the first time ever. \nThis is not a sign of an \u201ceconomic recovery\u201d. What this tells us is that our economy is very, very sick. \nAnd we can see evidence of this sickness all around us. For instance, the Los Angeles Times is reporting that homelessness in Los Angeles increased by 11 percent last year, and this marked the fourth year in a row that homelessness in the city has increased\u2026 \nHomelessness rose 11% in the city of Los Angeles and 5.7% in the county last year despite an intensive federal push that slashed the county ranks of homeless veterans by nearly a third, according to a report released Wednesday . \nThe increase marks the fourth consecutive year of rising homelessness in L.A., as local officials struggle to identify funding for billion-dollar plans they approved to solve the nation\u2019s most intractable homeless problem. \nLet us also not forget that about half the country is basically flat broke at this point. \nJust recently, the Federal Reserve found that 47 percent of all Americans could not pay an unexpected $400 emergency room bill without selling something or borrowing the money from somewhere. \nWith numbers such as these being reported, how in the world can anyone possibly claim that the U.S. economy is in good shape? \nIt boggles the mind, and yet there are people out there that would actually have you believe that everything is just fine. \nThe current occupant of the White House is one of them. \nWith each passing month, the real economy is getting even worse. We may not have slipped into a full-blown economic depression just yet, but it is coming. \nFor now, let us be thankful for whatever remains of our debt-fueled prosperity, because we don\u2019t deserve the massively inflated standard of living that we have been enjoying. \nWe have been consuming far more than we produce for decades, but it won\u2019t last for much longer. And when those days are gone for good, we will mourn them bitterly. A New Digital Cash System Was Just Unveiled At A Secret Meeting For Bankers In New York \u00bb alan \nSomebody will go out there and strip the copper out of them. The railroad then can write them off on insurance, problem solved. Jim Speaker \nI bet A lot of those engines get graffitied soon. Randy \nThe spot price of copper is too low right now to make it worthwhile. Have you ever seen how difficult it is to take wire out of a motor or generator? It\u2019s not like peeling a grape. The health of the economy of any nation can be gauged by the price of its copper. Scarcity of copper due to it being used for motors, generators and conductors in conduits makes the price go high, lack of expansion means the price will be low. Outside of industrial use and as a medium of exchange, there\u2019s not much use for copper. Except in the brass used for bullet casings. On our last scrap metal run down to the recycling place, we got $20.71 for 550 pounds of scrap iron. Pitiful. greyprepper \nDon\u2019t go giving me ideas now! I\u2019m reformed by golly. Fiona \nNobody tells us, but we\u2019re in a deep recession. And with either Trump or Clinton as next president, there is no hope for a change. (I really wonder if Sanders could do a better job). Bring the popcorn and the camping seats, the economic collapse is about to begin. K2 \nSad that you find this entertaining. Scott Comin \nthe shadow government controls it all!!! they give us entertainment every four years so we can hope for the change that never happens!!! Steeve Girard \nWe are in this mess because of Abrahamic beliefs. Steeve Girard \nThat is true, rotating politicians will not solve the problem, nor will they be willing to enforce an un-democratic change to the social order. The system will have to be abolish to repair society and adapt it to the new reality of a low energy world. It is unlikely to happen until we are totally immobilized. DareToCreateYourBestLife \nI see many people dying in this world before harmony is restored in a \u201clow energy world\u201d.

I wish a few others would have gone on vacation with them too. Robert \nThere is no telling when the locomotive photo was taken. That is a mainline track. Unused engines are stored in large train yards where they are kept maintained until used or sold off. I doubt they are stored in AZ as aircraft. Google photos can be years out of date. \nI am not doubting the numbers for freight traffic decline but the photo is not evidence. Jim Speaker \nI know where those locomotives are stored at. They are stored on the old Southern Pacific out of service Pheonix line east of Wellington,AZ. I took A picture of A few trains their back in 1996. Amtrak used to use that line. When the SP/UP merger came in 1996 it was abandond. Stephen \nThere is 50 to 70 maybe more BNSF train engines that have been sitting near downtown Oklahoma City for the last two months or more. While I agree that it is sad about the economic state of the country I have no sympathy for that criminal fraudster Mr. billionaire himself Warren Buffet that got a bailout from the tax payers back in 2008. Yup he Berkshire Hathaway owns BNSF and Union Pacific too I believe. He makes money as those goods move down the railway. Why do you think he fights that trans atlantic pipeline because competition is a sin. Steeve Girard \nThat means the QE money keep falling into vaults, and never comes out. Especially the Treasury vault. Once in there it can only do one thing, pay the Treasury Bonds that are coming back from the BRICS countries, which makes it disappear. The black holes they tried to fill (with QE programs) and never was able to blow it away from existence are still there, and are still doing damages to the economy. . And with the energy crisis increasing, new black hole vaults have started to appear around the world, because they are trying to decouple the US dollar from the energy sector. Richard \n\u201cGlobal trade is really, really slowing down\u201d \nReally really? I haven\u2019t seen this double repetition for months (a couple of years, maybe). Please don\u2019t let it creep back again. Barry Goldwater \nAm I wrong or shouldn\u2019t the content be the focus in the comment section ? Having said that I can say I read this article and as usual applaud Michael for getting news out that goes unmentioned by the lame stream media. Personally I\u2019ve been on the net for years and found the \u201cGrammar Police \u201d a bit obnoxious to say the least. Michael is doing a superb job and my hat\u2019s off to him. Jomine Jose \nThey went the way of the MarcoBird. rentslave \nOn the other hand,Powerball sales almost doubled since the last drawing.It seems that many TV stations show the drawing before the 11 PM news once it passes a certain point,proving that many affluent people still exist.It\u2019s still taking an inordinate amount of time to reach that level as the regular street players are just about tapped out. K2 \nCoal is slowing down because of natural gas. tom \nLet\u2019s not forget that the EPA under the president\u2019s direction is going after the coal industry too. I remember Hillary Clinton saying earlier this year that she would basically kill the US coal industry. SmallerGovNow2 \nand then she just recently said, \u201cthat\u2019s not what I meant\u201d. what a lying POS she is\u2026 tom \nNow I know that you have a highly developed sense of humor. Have you begun searching for a puppy? SunnyFlaSnotress \nI can think of something better to worship than one\u2019s self or a government. SunnyFlaSnotress \nDoes this ring a bell, Snotty? \nA god complex is an unshakable belief characterized by consistently inflated feelings of personal ability, privilege, or infallibility. A person with a god complex may refuse to admit the possibility of their error or failure, even in the face of irrefutable evidence, complex, or intractable problems or difficult or impossible tasks, or may regard their personal opinions as unquestionably correct. The individual may disregard the rules of society and require special consideration or privileges. \nAnd just whom is this paragraph describing? \nHere\u2019s a hint: Hillary is NOT God! \n\u2026She is GODESS!\u2026.(compliments of rarefied snotress) arresun \nThere is no Hillary \ud83d\ude00 Richard O.

Steeve Girard \nAll fossil fuels are slowing down due to quality and EROEI. We have now reached the commercially non-viable level 8:1\u2026 In 2030, we will reach the industrial non-viable level 5:1\u2026 that is when you will realize that industrial society just died.

Get prepared spiritually and economically. Steeve Girard \nThe Limits to Growth scenario (Business as Usual) scenario is still on course. It all points to an energy crisis in 2030, that is when everything will go hectic. dauden \nHow do you \u201cget prepared spiritually\u201d? When times are good ignore your soul but when times are about to get ugly, get spiritual? Explain please. SunnyFlaSnotress \n\u201cU.S. rail traffic was down more than 11 percent from a year ago in April.\u201d Oil dropped in Nov 2014. A few months gave people time to believe the drop wasn\u2019t a blip and trucking went into higher gear with new lower gas prices, passing the savings onto the clients. Hence, trucking likely gained more popularity for shipping some items. \u201cThis also tells us that \u201cthe real economy\u201d is really slowing down\u201d It\u2019s inordinately skewed to make that statement without showing a traffic comparison chart of trucking vs railing during that timeframe. p.s. waves and kisses to my adoring fans \ud83d\ude00 Ricardo \nStop blowing your snot everywhere you gross person SunnyFlaSnotress \nRicardo the Beaner starts the day on a good note Bill \nThanks for sharing your intelligence, now leave it at that and ignore the insults. SunnyFlaSnotress \nBillTheController took several moments to think of the right compliment for me. Bill \nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s all just a game. Willard Ferch \nThe surge was already there. Diesel is still relatively cheap. If there were buyers, there would be tons of shipping. Sales are needed to create the shipping.

Not sure it changes the big picture, though. Zaphod Braden \nEerily close \u2013 Who is John Galt? \ud83d\ude09 watchmannonthewall \nMaybe if Trump is elected TPTB will close up shop and just disappear and leave the good old US of A to fend for itself since voters didn\u2019t want to go along with their program. History repeats. Oh, sorry! That first was the book! sistersoldier \nI think the bomb shell that Trump dropped after winning the GOP nomination left a bad taste in the mouths of his supporters. He reported that he is not self funding the general election but rather will put together a finance committee with ties to George Soros to help raise the money to defeat Hillary. I\u2019m not sure but I think that some are suffering a hangover this morning as it is now apparent you cannot be a DC insider with out enlisting DC aid. Only the future will tell the whole story. But you are correct about the book. \ud83d\ude00 watchmannonthewall \nDon\u2019t know if you ever heard of Larry Burkett, was a mentor of Dave Ramsey. He wrote one novel, \u201cThe Illuminati\u201d about 1990 before his death. Seems a lot of what was in the book are actually being played out in events of today in the US. \nIt will be very interesting, and seems most likely, if Trump were to chose a running mate with strong ties to inside the Beltway and spcifically (though not actually known) with the elite. In the book, the president the people wanted but the elite didn\u2019t, was forced to chose a female VP the elite wanted and then they orchestrated events such that the Pres had to step down and, wow, they still got what they wanted! Interesting times!! sistersoldier \nWow! That is compelling! No I am not familiar with Larry Burkett but I most certainly will search to see if one of my local libraries has the novel you mentioned. If I am able to find it I will work it in with my fishing trip this weekend \u2013 if the fish are not biting I will be gearing up for the next leg of this race. We must enjoy the simple things while they last. Thanks for the heads up! watchmannonthewall \nIf I remember correctly Larry said, in the Forward, the only reason he wrote the book was because so many Christians were asking him to write a novel where he would lay out the events he thought would be most likely to occur to bring the anti-christ to power. When I read the book I sensed the content may have been prompted by the Holy Spirit, and Larry may have been more acccurate on events than he could have hoped for or dreamed. Funny thing is, I came across the book as a throwaway, cleaning out lockers, at an assembly plant I worked at 15 years ago. I need to get it out again and reread it. The book started with a major earthquake in Japan. sistersoldier \nI must find it! You appear to be a fellow truth seeker and the similarities to what is going on today appear to be striking to say the least. There is just too much going on in the world today and so much has been hidden from the masses that the truth is often buried in our past or by those who were not afraid to print what the Holy Spirit was leading them to do for a time such as this! Good information and good post! Bill \nIt is great to read good economic discourse and understand the true picture. Now let\u2019s get to some solutions. Chris \nWork hard. Stay out of debt. Save . greyprepper \nAnd don\u2019t forget to PREP! \ud83d\ude09 All_has_An _END_. \nGreat advise. I have done the last 2 for years. \nThe first one, not so much. Guest \nFor some, staying out of debt and saving is hard work (as in self-discipline). If you fit in either one of those two categories, then you can say the first one applies to you, too. grumpyhillbilly \nBetween the decades of lousy education and mass drug use, there is no simple fix. Steming the inflow of poverty might be a good start. End the war on men, especially white ones, would be another. And killing the Fed. Chris \nForget the trains!! What about the super volcano in the Yellowstone? The Zika virus? Jade Helm? The Illuminati? The housing bubble? The Fed? Low interest rates? Oil bubble? AAAAGGG Evan Elliott \nMy thoughts exactly. Such a confluence of events all at once\u2026. Richard O. Mann \nInformation overload. Oh yeah, that is problem too. Yes, it is an exciting time to be alive. Something about the tech market bubble deflating on one of the morning report programs. May have been Fox. Think I\u2019ll take a nap. Gay Veteran \nnot to mention outrage overload CASTIEL \none problem at a time friend K \nIn my area it was defiantly the war on coal, that killed the trains. Coal trains was about all that ran on the line. In my case it was CSX that was involved. Quite a few people were laid off. Because it ended up closing a repair shop for the railroad. People do not understand why Trump has the support, he has. Simple, people are sick and tired of D.C. making decisions, that cost them their jobs. It is really just that simple. When D.C. boasts they shut down the coal industry. You will have to excuse coal men, and railroad personnel for not cheering. SmallerGovNow2 \ngreat post k, thanks\u2026 Steeve Girard \nEven if the coal men did decide, it would not last long, because the coal they would produce would not be in acceptable standards for the buyers, for very long. K \nWould have to disagree, because I lived it. I live in the smoky mountains in Tn. Every winter, I could tell you how cold it was in Virginia, by how much smoke was in my area. This was from the coal fired electrical plants. Then around 2010 it all changed. The latest filters were installed on the stacks, and you know what. They worked. I seldom saw smoke during the winter. When it was cold enough. The ice went from opaque to being perfectly clear. But they had already decided to kill coal. So no amount of improvement mattered. The simple fact is. Once D.C. makes a decision, no amount of facts will make a difference. Their arrogance knows no bounds. sistersoldier \nYes indeed \u2018K\u2019 I agree. States such as Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia(s) are all under the same mandate by the \u201cEPA\u201d (supposedly) to reduce carbon emissions 32% by the year 2030. Converting the coal plants to natural gas which is reported to be cheaper and cleaner energy is underway where I live and near completion. There are trains collecting rust in my town as well. There is also a spike in my area of solar powered energy. Solar panels and equipment sales are soaring. Currently under construction are solar powered businesses, hotels, homes, new police station and state of the art hospital. I am not surprised to see the trains parked as they say \u201cthe only thing that is constant is change.\u201d jsmith \nCoal is an asset that this country has relied on for ages. And as you pointed out, much cleaner, and through the process of hydrogenation a cleaner gasoline than fracking can be made. I just can\u2019t understand if the Germans were relying on hydrogenation during WW2, why haven\u2019t we done it? Steeve Girard \nIt does not matter where the mercury ends, in the environment or the filters as you say. It\u2019s the quality of coal that is the problem: it\u2019s EROEI, Coal is getting more and more costly to produce and contains more impurities with passing time. It is only a matter of time before, it\u2019s grade is not acceptable. Mark \nGood observation and agree. mtntrek3 \nCoal will always have a part in the energy sector, but I\u2019m not seeing it returning to levels in the days of yesteryear. I\u2019ve suffered job losses because of the downturn in coal as well. The thing is all of the shale gas production has brought natural gas cost down considerably in the country, and of course gas burns cleaner. It has an unfair advantage in that respect over coal easily. We need some suitable substitutes for the coal industry jobs lost in the country for sure. If corporate greed would stand aside to allow our jobs to come back to the country\u2026\u2026. it would be a big help. We manufacture little of what we use/consume in the country. Globalism is another factor in all of this. God help. Mike_Travis \nCoal would be much less expensive were it not for the insane regulations that no one else in the world follows. Besides, it is NOT a function of the government to choose winners and losers in the market, nor is it within their power to CREATE losers which they frequently do. \nGlobalism is the driving force behind all this mess which is why we are in this mess as governments everywhere WANT a collapse so they can force their criminal NWO on us all, then rule over us as subjects, NOT citizens. mtntrek3 \nYes\u2026. globalism being pushed by the powers that be in this world the main problem. We don\u2019t need all the reg\u2019s on coal , but some are needed to keep pollution down. Nat. gas very cheap now and burns cleaner that coal that\u2019s been scrubbed\u2026\u2026.. so that\u2019s why coal is hurting so much now. Coal may make somewhat of a comeback in the future depending on what happens to gas production and geopolitical events here/worldwide. XSANDIEGOCA \n\u201cHow did you go bankrupt?\u201d \nTwo ways. Gradually, then suddenly.\u201d \u2013 Hemingway \nWe have been through the Gradual part. We may be on the cusp of the Sudden Part. Guest \nExcellent post. Many \u201csuddenlies\u201d yet to happen. sistersoldier \n\u201cIt is easier, more delightful, and more profitable to build with other peoples\u2019 money than our own.\u201d \nSo now we are beginning to see what happens when the powers that be run out of OTHER peoples\u2019 money. The economy derails and stalls. David \nThere is an old saying about putting lipstick on a Pig and it\u2019s still a pig. I think Obama & our economists that are so optimistic about our economy are running out of lipstick. Deny what you can & downplay what you can\u2019t seems to be DC Policy these days. as much as I love my country & miss the days of prosperity I would rather be told the Ugly truth about what is happening with our economy than to be lied to on a daily basis. Randy \n  that truth since 1996, the year I found out just how the world wide fiat paper currency/electronic bookkeeping entry financial system scam is actually set up and runs! And who wanted to listen to me and take real steps to get out of the way of that runaway train that is going to fly off the rails when it hits the curve? NOBODY!! Everyone I talked to said that I was a nut job, didn\u2019t know what I was talking about, et cetera, except for one guy. He did some preps, but then let life get in the way and undid most of it. Now he and his family are left standing nearly naked out in the cold night air. 1996 was also the year I wrote my first treatise on the subject, called What is Money? and it was ignored by most whom I shared it with. Steeve Girard \nYou can\u2019t make blind people read or deaf people hear. Randy \nYes, I have seen that over and over again. But I still do my best to give them sight and make them hear. Mark Sivad \nWhere I live in South Texas, I see many fairly new tank cars and bottom-dropping bulk carriers similarly stockpiled in places they never have been before (causing some local cities to complain). Must have been a tremendous over-building in all aspects of rail in recent years. LIZ THE SHIZ \nmy future son in law just got back from Barcelona which is one of the busiest ports in the world and the commercial side was completely shut down , something\u2019s going on??? jox \nThey keep changing the way GDP is calculated, so perhaps we will never see another recession, no matter what the true economic output is.

BIGOTIST \nRail workers? another \u201cspecial\u201d group of overpaid, over benefitted extortionists- Hopefully the thieves will all lose their job?~ JustBill \nIf the train derailment risk calculation uses these metrics: number of active locomotives, and miles logged by locomotives with no change to maintenance of both locomotives and rail equipment then we may see fewer train derailments. I\u2019ve found a bit of sunshine in the storm. All_has_An _END_. \nMake no mistake about it ,after the election it is all down hill. I also think the elites will do anything to stop Trump.

JustBill \nIf the American household is the center of the American economy, then the products and services it purchases, the wages earned by and the taxes/rent from collected from would drive the economy. \nIf the economy and financial systems were not artificial then I think Production and Consumption would be shackled together. \nWe\u2019ve been provided data that displays the retail slowdown, slowdown of both CONUS and OCONUS shipping, decreasing velocity of money, and many traditional concrete indicators of activity and economic health and all are trending down. \nCollapse or not nothing financial or economically appear to be healthy. \nIs this the new normal?

They have put out there for some R&R and to soak up some rays. mister_roboto \nThe same would be true if a caucasian member of the other major party were sitting in the Oval Office right now. Obama is as bought and paid for as nearly any other politician, so he says exactly what he is payed and commanded to say. The Kool-Aid drinkers of both of the major parties who are in the economic top 20%, as well as those who identify with them, have been increasingly adopted what I would call a \u201cprison guard\u201d sort of mentality towards the rest of society! House of Cards \nThe most alarming stat here is the crashing velocity of money, how fast money changes hands. If money isn\u2019t changing hands often, then the economy is slowing, period. These zero interest rates are creating more distortions. And the fact that the velocity of money is crashing along with zero rates is quite alarming. A major divergence. This cannot continue indefinitely. Orange Jean \nI wouldn\u2019t put too much stock in a photo from Goggle Earth showing a bunch of trains in the desert\u2026 unless there was other data proving they are idle. \nYears ago I took Amtrack cross country (from New Orleans to Chicago and then from Chicago to Orange County, CA). Going through the desert they had to stop and creep \u2026 no more than 30 mph they said because it was too hot and if it gets too hot the train could derail. We were 11 hrs late getting into CA from the last leg of my journey where I stopped in SLC for a week. WTP1776 \nObama promised that he would destroy the coal industry. sharonsj \nWell, if the stupid politicians had not taken bribes from the auto and gas industry, we might still have a functioning rail system instead so that ordinary people could still travel by train. \nI live in a rural area with no public transportation. All the small towns still have a rail line (and railroad stations) that are hardly used. If I could take a trail to the big city for shopping and entertainment, I would do it a minute. \nMeanwhile, as the rich get richer and the rest of us are impoverished, there is no extra money for us to buy anything other than the necessities. angie hoekstra \nHelpful writing .

As you read this, snowpack levels in the Sierra Nevada mountains are the lowest that have ever been recorded . That means that there won\u2019t be much water for California farmers and California cities once again this year. To make up the difference in recent years, water has been pumped out of the ground like crazy. In fact, California has been losing more than 12 million acre-feet of groundwater a year since 2011, and wells all over the state are going dry. Once the groundwater is all gone, what are people going to do? 100 years ago, the population of the state of California was 3 million, and during the 20th century we built lots of beautiful new cities in an area that was previously a desert. Scientists tell us that the 20th century was the wettest century in 1000 years for that area of the country, but now weather patterns are reverting back to normal. Today, the state of California is turning back into a desert but it now has a population of 38 million people. This is not sustainable in the long-term. So when the water runs out, where are they going to go? \nI have written quite a few articles about the horrific drought in California, but conditions just continue to get even worse. According to NPR, snowpack levels in the Sierra Nevada mountains are \u201cjust 6 percent of the long-term average\u201d \u2026 \nThe water outlook in drought-racked California just got a lot worse: Snowpack levels across the entire Sierra Nevada are now the lowest in recorded history \u2014 just 6 percent of the long-term average. That shatters the previous low record on this date of 25 percent, set in 1977 and again last year. \nCalifornia farmers rely on that water. Last year, farmers had to let hundreds of thousands of acres lie fallow because of the scarcity of water, and it is being projected that this year will be even worse \u2026 \nMore than 400,000 acres of farmland were fallowed last year because of scarce water. Credible sources have estimated that figure could double this year. \nFortunately, many farmers have been able to rely on groundwater in recent years, but now wells are running dry all over the state. Here is more from NPR \u2026 \nLast year was already a tough year at La Jolla Farming in Delano, Calif. Or as farm manager Jerry Schlitz puts it, \u201cLast year was damn near a disaster.\u201d \nLa Jolla is a vineyard, a thousand-or-so acres of neat lines of grapevines in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. It depends on water from two sources: the federal Central Valley Project and wells. \nUntil last year, Schlitz says, wells were used to supplement the federal water. \n\u201cNow, we have nothing but wells. Nothing. There\u2019s no water other than what\u2019s coming out of the ground,\u201d he says. \nLast year, one of those wells at La Jolla dried up. The farm lost 160 acres \u2014 about a million dollars\u2019 worth of produce, plus the wasted labor and other resources. \nAre you starting to understand the scope of the problem? \nDespite all of the wonderful technology that we have developed, we are still at the mercy of the weather. \nAnd if this drought continues to drag on, it is absolutely going to cripple a state that contains more than 10 percent of the total U.S. population. \nIn an attempt to fight the water shortage, Governor Jerry Brown has instituted statewide water restrictions for the first time ever \u2026 \nCalifornia announced sweeping statewide water restrictions for the first time in history Wednesday in order to combat the region\u2019s devastating drought, the worst since records began. \nGovernor Jerry Brown issued the declaration at a press conference in a parched, brown slope of the Sierra Nevada mountains that would normally be covered by deep snow. \n\u201cToday, we are standing on dry grass where there should be five feet (1.5 meters) of snow,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis historic drought demands unprecedented action.\u201d \nSo what will these restrictions include? \nThe following is a summary from Natural News \u2026 \n\u2022 A ban on non-drip irrigation systems for all new homes. \n\u2022 A requirement for golf courses and cemeteries to \u201creduce water consumption.\u201d (And yet, the very idea of green golf courses in the middle of a California desert is insane to begin with\u2026) \n\u2022 Force farmers to report more details on their water usage so that the state government can figure out where all the water is going (and where to restrict it even further). \n\u2022 Outlawing the watering of grass on public street medians. \n\u2022 Discussions are also under way to throw \u201cwater wasters\u201d in jail for up to 30 days, according to another LA Times article . The most likely source of intel for incarcerating water wasters will be neighborhood snitches who monitor water usage of nearby homes and call the authorities if they see too much water being used. \nIf the drought does not go on for much longer, these restrictions may be enough. \nBut what if it continues to intensify? \nThe following graphic shows the U.S. Drought Monitor map for the state of California for each of the last five years in late March\u2026 \nIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to see the trend. \nAnd scientists tell us that this might just be the beginning. There have been megadroughts in that area of the country that have lasted more than 100 years in the past, and there are fears that another megadrought may have begun. The following comes from National Geographic \u2026 \nCalifornia is experiencing its worst drought since record-keeping began in the mid 19th century, and scientists say this may be just the beginning. B. Lynn Ingram , a paleoclimatologist at the University of California at Berkeley, thinks that California needs to brace itself for a megadrought\u2014one that could last for 200 years or more. \nAs a paleoclimatologist, Ingram takes the long view, examining tree rings and microorganisms in ocean sediment to identify temperatures and dry periods of the past millennium. Her work suggests that droughts are nothing new to California. \n\u201cDuring the medieval period, there was over a century of drought in the Southwest and California. The past repeats itself,\u201d says Ingram, who is co-author of The West Without Water: What Past Floods, Droughts, and Other Climate Clues Tell Us About Tomorrow . Indeed, Ingram believes the 20th century may have been a wet anomaly. \nIf this is a megadrought, it is just a matter of time until massive migration will become necessary. \nIn fact, one UN official is already talking about it \u2026 \nIf the state continues on this path, there may have to be thoughts about moving people out, said Lynn Wilson, academic chair at Kaplan University and who serves on the climate change delegation in the United Nations. \n\u201cCivilizations in the past have had to migrate out of areas of drought,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe may have to migrate people out of California.\u201d \nWilson added that before that would happen, every option such as importing water to the state would likely occur\u2014 but \u201cmigration can\u2019t be taken off the table.\u201d \nSo how many people will ultimately have to leave if this drought continues for many years? \n5 million? \nAnd where will they go? \nPlease feel free to share what you think by posting a comment below\u2026 If Anyone Doubts That We Are In A Stock Market Bubble, Show Them This Article \u00bb Eric Rasbold \nIt is as bad as they say. I am lucky enough to live in the forested Eden of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, just a bit south west of Tahoe. We have water. We are one of four purveyors of water in El Dorado County. We are okay as far as water goes, but the rest of the state is in great danger. We are mostly worried about fire. Last year, we had two major fires: The Sand Fire almost took my home from the south, the King Fire (the largest ever) almost burnt us down from the north. I think dead center is next. Rough winds and crappy seas doth follow. \nGood Luck and May Your Dow Never Jones. David Almanza \nAll I see day after day and night after night here in Kansas is a sky full of toxic spray that resemble cobwebs . I guess the thing has to eat itself and lay waste to nature in the process . No one can own the Earth and Sky ,,,have faith in Nature within Us and Nature outside of Us and protect it as much as we can. It is all We have . Erik Bergum \nThe state of California desperately needs the rain of course MIchael in Chicago \nThe entire state needs rain just about everyday for several years to start to catch up. Needs an insane amount of snow too. GSOB \nPerhaps the Lord is telling Californians to get out before His earthquake swallows them up? He is a merciful God. alan \nHum, doesn\u2019t sound very nice to me. H8Religion \nHe is a merciful God Like he has mercy on his Child Raping Priests!!!! JI \nYes, homosexuals/pedophiles infiltrated the church and the church failed to excommunicate them. For that, the church is indeed being punishes. If you are a victim, and you sound like one, seek counseling and help. MIchael in Chicago \nMuch like the US economy everyone seems to have this false hope things will eventually get better. Water restrictions and importing more water are not all that different from QE. Seems like everything is an illusion these days. Bill \nIn the old days if you wanted to seek your fortune you would hear,\u201dgo West young man, go West.\u201d Now days those who live in the West are told \u201d go East if you want to survive.\u201d \nNo matter where Californians go it will put tremendous pressure on the infrastructure of other areas. Then add the demand on a decreasing food supply. The hand that fed us may not be so welcome when it looks to be fed. John \nNot to mention that many of those Californians are going to demand government assistance like they\u2019ve had in CA wherever they settle. John \nInteresting. The Sooners migrated there in mass from Oklahoma in the 1930\u2019s. Now their great grandchildren may migrate the other way. Also, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a civilization collapsed in that area of the country. Take the Anasazi Indian civilization for example. XSANDIEGOCA \nExcellent point. SunnyFlaSnotress \nYou\u2019re comparing a rustic civilization to a far more progressive civilization. Migration is the probability. Only massive destruction in the form of land upheaval would cause collapse. John \nThe Anasazi also likely moved elsewhere when their society could no longer be supported by the local environment/climate. Anyway, they apparently abandoned their dwellings in northern AZ for unknown reasons. Severe drought is one possibility. The Clovis people were an even earlier people group in the SW USA whose society appeared to vanish too.

The soil up north can\u2019t and will never have the time to evolve to the point you could plant the crops and food necessary to live as we have over the last 10,000 years. \nPeople think they are going to plant Banana trees in the Arctic. Ain\u2019t gonna happen. Priszilla \nYou need compost. My dad used manure in the garden. We didn\u2019t grow bananas. But peaches tomatoes, apples, pears, beans, cucumber and other veggies. Priszilla \nThat go north was more sarcasm to those who think global warming is good. I prefer planting trees. For shade, wind break, fruits, flowers.

Most of them are one paycheck from bankruptcy. They are underwater in their loans. Their $800,000 houses will be worthless and abandoned, and they have no savings. There are no jobs for them outside California. They have no manual labor skills and they have kids to feed. They would not last a week outside California before they start stealing food and property of those in other states. Philip Botwinick \nYou get it. T. \nI agree. In all honesty there will be No \u201cGo East\u201d. Most will go to their Grave. Jordan Helwig \nWe need to spend our money domestic problems like these.

In the movie \u201cSoylent Green\u201d, everyone remembers that it turns out the wafers were made from corpses, but that movie had several other-almost prophetic now- things that were creepy. One was the euthanasia centers where people who reached older age, even though healthy, would be asked to go to termination centers and be euthanized for the greater good and population control\u2026. Another one, was that things like strawberries, wine, real food and HOT SHOWERS WITH WATER\u2013were still available, but only for the wealthy. Apartments could be rented with all of the amenities ( including house girls who catered to all needs of the wealthy businessmen.) All of those old, apocalypse movies are a little creepy now\u2013Omega Man with the global virus\u2026.Planet of The Apes with the transhumanism we are seeing experimented with\u2026\u2026.Terminator with all of the advances in robotics and AI thinking machines\u2026..very interesting times we live in.

It knows no boundaries. \nWhere ever those people leaving CA go will not be far behind in looking like Sao Paulo and Detroit in the next few years. \nDo not. I repeat do not even feed into the illusion that we\u2019ll find free energy, or solar and wind will come along. That\u2019s a Hollywood delusion. If energy were really free than no corporation would be able to lock up the rights to it in a vault. Read \u201cGreen Illusions\u201d by Ozzie Zehner. sean carter \nAgree with everything you said. I live in Alberta and the common mythology is we\u2019ll dig up tarsands forever. Not gonna happen. Once once the cheap energy run out our society will be sliding back towards something resembling the mid-1800\u2019s ranging/farming dominated lifestyles. \nAnd I\u2019m fine with that. Ray \n\u201cLook, Israel was a bona fide desert,\u201d argues Hazard, who has been pushing for desalination. \u201cNow they run the whole country on four desal plants.\u201d egore \nThe really bad part is all those liberals gushing out of the state into the rest of the US like diarrhea. Buckle Up! Ted Kennedy \nHopefully they\u2019ll migrate into Mexico. Will Mexico accept our liberal refugees? Richard O. Mann \nMexico does not want them. They are too busy trying to export their population to the US. Mexifornia Taxpayer \nHow about they learn some birth control! SunnyFlaSnotress \nYou\u2019re right. If we keep a strong dollar and water prices are elevated, more companies will migrate south and many of California\u2019s immigrants, which number somewhere around 10 million, will likely follow Mexico\u2019s new prosperity. Priszilla \nIt\u2019s not just California where there is a problem with water usage. \nSince 1950, agricultural irrigation has reduced the saturated volume of the Ogallala aquifer by an estimated 9%. Depletion is accelerating, with 2% lost between 2001 and 2009 alone. Once depleted, the aquifer will take over 6,000 years to replenish naturally through rainfall. \nIn the United States, the biggest users of water from aquifers include agricultural irrigation and oil and coal extraction. \nThe United States Geological Survey determined the water level in the aquifer has dropped more in Texas than in any other state in the basin. \nWasting natural resources is an American problem. Ken Swan \nyeah those inland cities with millions of people using the ground water has nothing to do with it does it? California created this problem (NOT nature) by demanding that 90% of the states water be pumped to LA for use there, so what did they think was going to happen? Priszilla Liberty First \nJust do not come to Texas. PLEASE! \nI do not feel very sorry for California, in truth. They have fought desalinization projects like bats out of hell. And converted sea water could make a massive difference in stemming this drought. Environmental concerns, they say. Oh well. Irresponsible people tend to reap negative results. Mike \nI already applied to three jobs in Texas, haha! Maybe I\u2019ll be your neighbor. Liberty First \nWell unlike in CA we are friendly to almost anyone down here. Mike \nDesalinization won\u2019t work anyway. It doesn\u2019t remove 100% of the salt and in a desert region like cal it would evaporate too quickly depositing the trace amounts of salt in the soil rendering it unsuitable. Liberty First \nOrange County has desal. It works just fine. Don\u2019t Want \u2019em here \nI feel sorry for you if you get an influx of those lunatics! Kurt \nThey can just give the State back to Mexico, let them worry about it. Lol VegasBob \nTo be fair, about 3/4 of California water usage is for agriculture. Without adequate water, I would look for steep increases in the price of fruits and vegetables and depopulation of agricultural areas. Maybe persistent drought will finally stem some of the mass migration from South of the Border into the US. \nAs for the leftists, they can stay in the Bay Area. They\u2019re probably not going to be forced out. AntonioOssa \nCALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PUT A STOP TO AGRICULTURE IMMIDIATELY! Mike \nPeople and animals need to eat drama queen. nobody \nIf only we could import food from other places\u2026 mar1950 \nDoes anyone know what % of the economy (GDP) comes from California? I seem to recall that if Cal. were a nation it would be the 6th largest economy in the world. If it did dry up and no one could live there, what would it do to the nation as a whole? \nI would like to see the governor call the state to pray for rain (and snow in the mountains) but then the Bible declares: \u201cHe (man, state, or nation) that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.\u201d (Proverbs 28:9) \nCalling on God to intervene while the abortion mills are still doing business, we are busy passing gay \u201cmarriage\u201d laws, and have a brutal militaristic foreign policy that spreads death and destruction around the world we would only be mocking God and adding abomination on top of abomination.

Then after that, really check into whether or not the Dixie Crats of the South actually became Republicans (cause that\u2019s where I see this going next \u2013 and then after that\u2026. more Leftist talking points with absolutely no substance)\u2026.\u201d \nsee above, it was YOU Christians that \u201cendorsed, promoted and pushed for Jim Crow laws\u201d and I love how you historical revisionists try to deny that racist southern democrats became racist southern republicans, like the GOP\u2019s southern strategy never happend \n\u201c\u2026Please stop twisting things to support your hatred and stereotypes and I will at least try not to stereotype you.\u201d WOW, such projection, such massive hypocracy coming from a \u201cChristian\u201d who supposedly believes in the Golden Rule. now don\u2019t you have a street corner to pray loudly at? Ron Gilbert \n\u201cAnd immoral? you can go F yourself with a rusty chainsaw because I don\u2019t take lectures on morality from smug self-righteous Pharisees like YOU.\u201d \nAnd the hypocrisy continues. It\u2019s wrong for me to dictate morals but not wrong for you to tell me to go\u2026 f myself. Also, I don\u2019t pray in public. If you knew anything about God, you would know that those doing so are not praying to him, they are praying for praise from others. \n\u201cWOW, such projection, such massive hypocracy coming from a \u201cChristian\u201d who supposedly believes in the Golden Rule.\u201d The Golden Rule is applied when you tell someone that they are doing something wrong. It is done so that they can better themselves by stopping their behavior. Kind of like waking your neighbor from a deep sleep while his house burns. Smugness never entered my mind but it sure did show from your tirade. My ending statement is rescinded. I will continue to believe that you are a willing participant in evil. Gay Veteran \n\u201cAnd the hypocrisy continues. It\u2019s wrong for me to dictate morals but not wrong for you to tell me to go\u2026 f myself\u2026.\u201d \nhey junior, it\u2019s wrong for you to dictate morals for OTHER people, which is precisely why I told you to go F yourself you smug self-righteous theocrat. \n\u201c\u2026Also, I don\u2019t pray in public. If you knew anything about God, you would know that those doing so are not praying to him, they are praying for praise from others\u2026..\u201d \nif the shoe fits\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \n\u201c\u2026The Golden Rule is applied when you tell someone that they are doing something wrong. It is done so that they can better themselves by stopping their behavior. Kind of like waking your neighbor from a deep sleep while his house burns\u2026.\u201d \nbecause YOUR interpretation of the bible is the ONLY valid one, not like there are tons of Christians who disagree with you. \n\u201c\u2026I will continue to believe that you are a willing participant in evil\u2026.\u201d \nthat is your opinion, and opinions are like a**holes, everyone has one \n\u201c\u2026Please, by all means, show me where God ever condoned it [slavery]. He allows it just like he allows people to sin without immediate death. He allows us to make our own decisions but when those decisions are against what he tells us to do, they come with consequences\u2026.\u201d \nwow, so all those southern slaveowners weren\u2019t quoting the Bible to justify slavery? see, there\u2019 s that historical revisionism again \n\u201c\u2026speaking of revisionism\u2026. all Dixie Crats did not become Republicans no matter how much you insist history says they did. That was a revisionism from your buddies in the DNC years ago, so that they could point their crooked little fingers at Conservatives and claim that we are the racists, much like you are doing\u2026.\u201d yeah, the democratic party in the south just mysteriously declined after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. btw junior, I detest the democrats as much as the republicans, if fact more so because so many liberals are hypocrites (whereas the republicans actually believe their BS)\u201c\u2026According to every single bit of research done, only a handful of Dixie Crats switched over to the Republican Party while the VAST majority of them stayed in the DNC. Nice try though.\u201d every single bit of reseach, eh? odd you didn\u2019t provide any Ron Gilbert \nBut you can dictate them to Christians? Gay Veteran \nhow so? Ron Gilbert \nReally? You have to ask that after stating that Christians have no right to push their morals on you? Have you ever taken into account that when you tell someone that they have no right to tell you what to do, you are doing exactly what you are protesting? It\u2019s just like saying \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d. You are telling the other person what to do. Really? And you see nothing hypocritical about that? Of course you don\u2019t. Why would you? You see things through a clouded vision of love right? Gay Veteran \noh I see, we gays must shut up while smug self-righteous Pharisees like you give us a lecture on \u201cmorality\u201d. that\u2019s what wannabe theocrats like you want \nsorry junior, but we ALL have freedom of speech. You can lecture me all you want and I can tell you to stuff it Ron Gilbert \nOh I see\u2026 we Christians must shut up while the immoral acts of gays are being force upon the population. Sorry gay dude, but freedom of speech does not just apply to you and those that you agree with. Gay Veteran \nacts of gays being forced upon the population, eh? what, did a gay guy come up and French kiss you? you know, it sounds like you need to move to a country where there are lots of people just like you! try Saudi Arabia Ron Gilbert \nRound and round we go. Gay Veteran \n\u201cRound and round we go\u201d \ntranslation from trollspeak: I just got whipped yet again Ron Gilbert \nRound and round we go. Gay Veteran \nwhat an utter retard you are! \nyou want to tell me what to do but I can\u2019t say \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d \nyou\u2019re such a knuckle dragging mouth breather that it\u2019s amazing you haven\u2019t drowned in your own shower Ron Gilbert Gay Veteran \nyeah, I was speaking of you. \nbtw, is that you Malcolm? because you sure write the same kind of drivel he writes Ron Gilbert \nRound and round we go\u2026 Ron Gilbert \nRound and round we go..

Gay Veteran \ngod supposedly gave you a brain, try using it occasionally Ron Gilbert \nRound and round we go\u2026. Ron Gilbert \nAnd facts are not what you are looking for. Revenge is\u2026. keep up the good work for your masters. They will be your undoing in the end. Gay Veteran \na , somebody has a problem with legal equality for minorities. so sad you can no longer discriminate against them fa** ots, ni** ers, ki kes, etc. Ron Gilbert \nYou are not a race. You cannot claim that you are within the definition of minorities. Take a hike you justifier of hate. Gay Veteran \nhey Einstein, Mormons aren\u2019t a race either but anti-discrimination laws protect them Ron Gilbert \nThen stop using examples of racial discrimination to support you being discriminated against. Gay Veteran \noh, so you agree that Mormons aren\u2019t a race but anti-discrimination laws protect them Ron Gilbert \nOf course, that is a religion and as do the laws protect sexual orientation in the area of employment, housing, and being served in a restaurant. But being forced to bake a cake for a gay wedding, or cater a gay wedding, is not the same as you people perpetuate it to be. You are telling people to PARTICIPATE in that activity. It does not mean you won\u2019t be served by them in their establishment, as you tried to tie in discrimination against blacks for not being served by whites in the South. Again, and for the last time, if you don\u2019t support traditional marriage values from Christian business owners, go somewhere else. Freedom of choice is what you Libs want, isn\u2019t it? But no\u2026 instead of wanting equality in laws (such as the pursuit of happiness for your opposition) you believe your rights super cede the rights of others to tell you no. Totalitarianism comes to mind with the logic that you push\u2026. but you keep up that line of reasoning as you continue to believe that I am the stupid one\u2026 round and round we go\u2026 Ron Gilbert \nRound and round we go Gay Veteran \n\u201cRound and round we go\u201d \ntranslation from trollspeak: I just got whipped again Ron Gilbert \nRound and round we go.. Gay Veteran \ngod supposedly gave you a brain, try using it occasionally.

Illegal \nThere are people who believe Geoengineering techniques are being used to create this crisis. Least we forget we are dealing with information that is manipulated or is very one sided and incomplete.Like climate cooling/warming/change we are being feed an orthodoxy so we have our freedoms taken away. Force the small farmers out of business. Let the big ag corporations be handed the bankrupt farmers land. Poof! End of the drought. \nI think I\u2019m glad I moved out last year! (PS: NOT liberal) Philip Botwinick \nClimate Change and probably your God doesn\u2019t give a hoot if you are liberal or conservative. \nNature Bat\u2019s Last. \nClimate Change is occurring in every single corner of the planet. There is no place to run where it will not have an impact. Hart Shepherd \nBut it was climate change that forced our hand at coming down out of the trees in the first place and evolving to the point that we could even be having this conversation. We were born in that briar patch. Linda Starr \nSorry, Philip, but my comment was in part a response to egore\u2019s comment 3 days ago: \u201cThe really bad part is all those liberals gushing out of the state into the rest of the US like diarrhea. Buckle Up!\u201d Climate has always changed and has always had an impact\u2026bet your God knows that, too! Captain Canuck \nJust to put this into perspective. The population of California alone is roughly the same as the entire country of Canada. We have the same problems as California as our snowpack is also dwindling rapidly. This is a continental crisis, and we are going to have to get very creative generating potable water locally, as there really is nowhere to escape to. Yawn Hugh \nJunior Canuck; Come to northern Ontario. We have had lots and lots of snow the last few years and this year I have about 3\u2032 still remaining in our yard as I write this on Easter. Lots of cold and snow paints the picture of Northern Ontario. Just came back from 4 months in Yukon\u2026\u2026hardly any cold and snow there this winter. Scott \nThe snow pack in the James Bay area and throughout SE Canada is still over 2 feet, which produces a tremendous amount of fresh runoff water. Yermomandeye \nThey should go wherever Obama goes next year. James Hammett \nhawaii and feed them to the volcanoes as human sacrifice? Matibob \nNo thanks. Mike Smithy \nBuild a nuclear power plant in the Mojave Desert and dedicate the power to desalinate water drawn from the Pacific. In the unlikely event of a nuclear disaster, the only creatures at risk will be scorpions and rattlesnakes. Win/Win either way. Problem solved. nobody \nHardly, you will still have to source the uranium fuel and dispose of the waste.. And please tell me that you really don\u2019t think that a disaster will limit itself to a very tiny region. Mike Smithy \nThe USA already has a deep geological repository for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Unfortunately, President Zero closed it down in 2011 for political reasons. I.E. The environmental wacko nutjob lobby. \nYucca mt is full. U can\u2019t keep storing that stuff forever. Mike Smithy \nKim, the U.S. Government spent millions of dollars constructing the Yucca Mountain containment facility. However, the facility does store any nuclear wast at the present time due to decades of legal red tape and political hurdles. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s a massive, yet empty man made cave. nobody \nActually no, it has already wasted all the easily available uranium ore and what we still have costs a fortune to refine. BTW that deposit has been closed because it has been proved to be situated in an insecure location \u2013 the mountain is heavily cracked and they discovered that only halfway thru building it. \u201d The environmental wacko nutjob lobby\u201d\u2013 that clearly indicates your level of intelligence so i have no hope of convincing you with reasonable fact-based arguments. Please carry on. Irma Johnson \nI live in Las Vegas and the thought of all of them coming here really is scary. We already have water problems as it is. nobody \nYou are kidding, right? Because you are already living in a desert. SunnyFlaSnotress \nOh no.. Vegas has it\u2019s own drought happening. It\u2019s economy is based on luxury spending which is likely going to drop. Just look at Atlantic City Casinos. We can blame neighboring state casinos for that, buy it likely isn\u2019t the total story. Mexifornia Taxpayer \nWait until you cannot get cheap Hydro Power from the Colorado River and then you will be thirsty and in the dark!

Tom \nThe Grapes of Wrath Part 2?? alan \nA lot of the southern part of the state is desert, so kind of a fail on their part. But it sounds like it might be good news for the South, Florida specially. I am sure what they will do is just import everything from Mexico and let the farms die. Priszilla \nOh well, the US has about the size of China, much more greenery but only a fourth of its population. Let China open her borders to enable the emigration of 300 million Chinese to America. Bruce David \nDecades ago many of those Californians began migrating to where I lived in AZ. They had already screwed things up with their LA smog drifting to our valley. Once transplanted they planted so much CA-style vegetation our average humidity rate raised from 6% to 26% and our realty prices skyrocketed. Then even more illegals filtered into the valley\u2026in other words, I know where they\u2019ll head and they\u2019ll try to screw up AZ [they are even trying to overturn our gun laws to resemble CA style communism]. Priszilla \nThe greens will create a forest garden or permaculture. They will grow trees and bushes and herbacious plants and root plants. The trees and shrubs will reduce evaporation and soil erosion by wind. The monoculture farmers will go crashing. They just need a virus to destroy what they still have left. \nNature is showing us forever how things are done. We are just too proud to watch and listen. XSANDIEGOCA Kim \nWe went up to mt hood in Oregon last Sunday to mushroom hunt. There\u2019s no snow up there. Palmer is the only lift that\u2019s open, as far as I\u2019ve heard There is no snow at Mt Hood Meadows or Snoqualmie up in Washington. I saw it like this a few years ago, but never this bad. Winter skipped the northwest this year. We had, maybe, one or two days of freezing temps and that\u2019s about it. Southern Oregon and eastern Washington is dying on the vine with California. LAWD \nLake Powell is going down fist along with the glen canyon dam K2 \nwhat? since when has this been happening? why bother \nI shared a shuttle bus to JWA with a group of skiers Friday morning. They obviously had skis and snowboards in the long bags. I asked them where they found snow. They said Colorado. libsarescum \nPlease move to Washington or Oregon, and take your illegals with you. We don\u2019t need Californians to ruin our the rest of the country. True Grit \nWe could get rid of ten million if we just deported the illegals! SunnyFlaSnotress \nCalifornia\u2019s immigrants number around 10 million, not its illegals. Bruce Wayne \nthere will likely be plenty of more Mexican Migrants only to happy to take up residence anywhere in California SunnyFlaSnotress \nNot if the jobs tank, and water bills go up along with other basic costs of living, as would be likely in a prolonged drought scenario. 1fifty \nYes. And the reason is that climate change models show Mexico and Central America also going thru a mega drought. True story. \nAnd California migrants will move where they want to, not necessarily where other people think they should move to. Also, people in the pacific nw should realize that if the mega drought really settles in, then here comes California for Columbia River water. \nFinally, it\u2019s not just California, but New Mexico, Arizona, west Texas, and Nevada that will also have the same mega drought. And, possibly, Utah. Elmo Fudginputz \nClimate change models? Is that a type of slot machine Vegas? They aren\u2019t worth horse poop except to insane people. Philip Botwinick \nWell Elmo, you seem to be one of those \u201ceducated\u201d USA citizens that Morris Berman and Chris Hedges write about. \nBet you believe that water doesn\u2019t really boil at 212 degrees F. \nWhether you believe in Climate Change or not doesn\u2019t matter. Climate/weather could give two craps about what or if you are even capable of thought. Your just a piece of gum stuck on the body of Nature\u2019s foot. Squish. Squish. \nHistory is full of people like you and on an overpopulated planet (just try to live by putting all the world\u2019s population in the state of Texas and then see how that works out) the reduction in the human species could only be a benefit to all other species on the planet. Elmo Fudginputz \nThere is no science supporting man-made global warming. Its a delusion. That probably suggests you are also a progressive who believes in lots of other delusions. All the climate models to date have been wrong. None of them work. 10\u2019s of thousands of scientists and engineers reject man-made global warming. In fact, during the last 15 years the Earth has been cooling \u2013 all notwithstanding your delusional addiction to fantasy and scientists having been repeatedly discovered to have adulterated data to support man-made global, for the benefit of the organizations who fund their research; making it a criminal enterprise as well . When a liberal uses the word \u201cscience\u201d in support of an argument, its not science at all but delusion, fairy tale and fantasy. You also probably believe Obama was born in Hawaii\u2026HaHaHa! afchief \nYou are right! Global warming has nothing to do with science. It has to do with CONTROL. Controlling us!!! P\u2019od Accountant \njust because you can\u2019t understand or comprehend the science doesn\u2019t mean human activity isn\u2019t changing the earth at a global. you sound like a blind man railing against light because you can\u2019t see it. airedale \nHuman activity warming the planet makes no logical sense. Humanity is like atomic particles dancing on the shell of an egg, while the shell is like the earths crust floating on a mass of magma (the egg white) which surrounds a core of molten iron (the yolk). It is like saying your breath will warm a volcano. joe oberr \nPlease prove that human activity is changing the earth (I presume you mean on a global basis). Since carbon is way less than 0.05% of greenhouse gases and is NOT a poison or pollutant but is necessary for life (human, animal and plant) how is it that climate changers somehow conclude human activity is bad for the earth and life? Water vapor constitutes 95% of greenhouse gases. There is no historical evidence indicating warming periods followed increases in co2 emissions or in the atmosphere. How do you explain \u201cThe Pause\u201d? (The Pause is the documented fact that there has been no global warming for the past 17 years). Briarpatch \nThere you go again with the water only boiling at 212 degrees F again how many times, moron are you going to use that INCORRECT statement. Go look in an eighth grade science book. joe oberr \nPB \u2013 If you and all others who share this view are logical the next step would be for you and the others to end your lives in order to benefit all the other species on the planet. But since I do not see that happening I can only conclude you are not being truthful and/or you really do not believe what you just said. Fat Hubie \nLet\u2019s start the reduction with you\u2026 DixieAngel_76 \nGood, why don\u2019t you go first? 1fifty \nAlways glad to read thoughtful, insightful responses from an intelligent commenter. pmagn \nhey your going to be a migrant soon. show some compassion. sherlock32555 \nNot if we grow a set and put a stop to these idiots that put illegals first and we the people last. But what can you except from the brain washed people. It\u2019s going tot take people that want to save us! Elmo Fudginputz \nLet\u2019s invade Mexico and oust the rich and Catholic Church officials, and then make it into our 51st state. Let\u2019s finish the work Zachary Taylor started. gleb glebster \nIf anyone wanted Mexico, they wouldn\u2019t be flocking here by the thousands. simoin \nMexicans were actually in California first! but in the end no one should invade anyone. And seeking a better life is not invading. what rich catholic church officials? mexico is a poor place. And why target catholics? obviously the liberals are the ones with all the money in this country. They own the media,hollywood,government,corporations and even the main internet sites like youtube/google. But following Jesus Christ and waking people up is what matters not ousting people. And stop tearing Christians apart by attacking Catholics who are Christians. Catholic church atleast has teachings that never change unlike unfortunately many protestant churches who are siding with liberalism and evil. Christians need to stick together to make the world a more peaceful and loving place with Jesus Christ! Ron Gilbert \n\u201cCatholic church atleast has teachings that never change\u201d \nThe Catholic Church has adopted many teachings from other religions through out history in order to make their religion more palatable. Take for example purgatory. You won\u2019t find it in the Bible but you will find it in other religions. How about when they taught that the Earth was both flat as well as the center of the universe (Galileo was excommunicated for teaching the opposite and then was \u201callowed\u201d into Heaven when the Catholic Church finally admitted their mistake \u2013 wouldn\u2019t God know his own creation?)? I could go on with this but it would only be rubbing salt into a wound. Needless to say, the Catholic Church does not represent God, never has. Their method of salvation is one of works while God says salvation is by grace through Jesus Christ alone. We work BECAUSE of our salvation not for it. True Catholic \n\u201cThere are not a hundred people in America who hate the Catholic Church. There are millions of people who hate what they wrongly believe to be the Catholic Church.\u201d\u2013 Bishop Fulton Sheen. Centurion53 \nAnd look at the third world S h i t hole the Mexicans have created with their wonderful country\u2026.Round up the criminal invaders and ship them ALL back to that Hell hole!! jamessrq \nI am not going to address \u2018who was first\u2019 but I will THANK YOU for advocating Christian people not antagonize each other. VigilanteCaregiver \nWOW! Who knew obeying the law has benefits! BabylonUSA \nThe Pilgrims, they came to America seeking religious freedom rather than \u201cobeying the queen of England\u201d\u2026 VigilanteCaregiver \nWell yeah. I was being a little sarcastic\u2026 \nAt the same time, if you look at English legal tradition there\u2019s always been a sense of the people having an established basis of liberty. Before the Roman invasion many communities elected their Chieftain for a set period of time. Before feudalism came in 1066, the English monarchy was more of an elected office with elected officers and magistrates. The Scottish Clan system was the same way. Whenever the monarch became a tyrant, the citizens usually ran him out or died trying. The idea of the Round Table came through this tradition. \nThe Pilgrims (or Saints as they called themselves) were part of the Brownist Reformation movement. The King assumed Church and State powers during Henry VIII\u2019s bloody, psychotic reign and was continuing this non-traditional practice; throughout almost all of English history the King was subject to God, not able to pretend he was the spokesman for God and could force the people to his beliefs. In this view, the King was in violation of English legal tradition. user z \nYou are comparing leaving a country to entering it illegally? Have trouble with common sense much? Ed \nSo immigrating to America and exterminating the indigenous Indian population was legal? user z \nWould you have preferred that the indigenous exterminated your ancestors? Another lacking common sense. What exactly do you propose against those wearing animal skins projecting arrows and hatchets at you? h ? jamessrq \nHold up. Both of you need to realize that you are addressing two different subjects. Pilgrims did not conquer the south or the west so they had nothing to do with exterminating Indians. They enjoyed good relations with the majority of \u2018locals\u2019 they encountered. Remember Thanksgiving? \nNow, if you want to go after those who did commit the crimes you describe, make sure you do not generalize and ascribe guilt to all Anglos. Instead, state which people were responsible because not every settler was some \u2018evil land grabber\u2019. How about starting with Andrew Jackson who infamously proclaimed the only good Indian was a dead one? How about getting Barry Hussein to take Jackson off the $20 instead of Hamilton, who opposed slavery, off the $10? That would be more productive. Or, try to address James Polk who pushed \u2018manifest destiny\u2019. Stay specific and you can have a meaningful conversation. Get caught in generalities and you will only sow the seeds of insults. Get it right \nYou bet, that was then this is now! Get out of my country deadbeat, get out of the USA deadbeat, stay out. puchache \nYeah, user z. It looks like you are proving the old adage that common sense is not so common. Look who is talking. \nWhere did the pilgrims obtain their immigration permits from? From the Sioux? From the Wampanoag? user z \nCommon sense would indicate that there was no established law or government when the pilgrims got here. Good luck getting some common sense. puchache \nIn addition to a lack of reasoning, you exemplify typical ignorance. I bet you\u2019re the type that can\u2019t point to where Alaska is, much less, say Chile. \nThe natives had their laws, their constitutions and their civilizations. eejit. user z \nI have been around the world in Asia and Europe. Its a shame you can\u2019t even refute the fact that your example was asinine as there was no government when the pilgrims got here. Changing the subject is a total fail. Greling Jackson \nYour \u201chistory\u201d sounds like something a bunch of self-serving land-hungry white men dreamed up before pulling out their quill pens to write. user z \n\u201cOf, by, and for the people\u201d IS a VERY self-serving\u201d phrase. It serves every self for which it was established and it\u2019s called civilized FREEDOM. So until you can come up with your own \u201cmore perfect union\u201d government why don\u2019t you just shut your ignorant, history deficient pie hole or go live somewhere else where the government owns your land, tells you where you can work, and forces you to live in abject poverty, because your bedwetting here is stinking the country up. Maybe you would prefer Kenya since it wasn\u2019t formed by white men. P\u2019od Accountant \nthen you will also have no food in addition to no water, idiot. DixieAngel_76 \nOh yeah, because people never ate until the illegals came along to \u2018save us all\u2019 from ourselves. Nicholi Hel \nIn the Bay Area Alone! user z \nYea Kalifornia, enjoy your over-populated and illegal diversity Kees Roma \nIn a way, though, it\u2019s kind of poetic justice\u2026the illegals flood California, the U.S. Government refuses to stop them and the California government (including the Governor Brown) betray our own nation and create laws to welcome them and, in the end, they will get nothing but desert\u2026you have to love the irony\u2026and I kind of like the scorched earth policy\u2026if we can\u2019t have it, neither can they\u2026 LAWD \nStart with: If it\u2019s yellow, let it mellow, if it\u2019s brown flush it down.

Two examples of what our highly touted education system believes is critical thinking. \nLet\u2019s build more desalination plants (of course how will they be powered, oh by nuclear) which will produce more water so we can grow more food and use more fertilizers and create more dead zones. More food means more people so that we can stress out the planet even more. \nWatch Albert Bartlett\u2019s Exponential Function on youtube and open your minds. \nAnd don\u2019t believe the hype about fitting all the people on the planet in the state of Texas. Just take a breath and think about what that would be like. guest \nHow does Saudi Arabia get water? PhDProfessor \nThey smartly built desalinization plants to provide a stable supply of fresh water. Ronald D Morrison \nCalifornia should start with recycling the water back into the dry lakes that is released by its sewer treatment plants. In our area the water released into the ocean is pure enough to drink when it comes out of the plants. In Hampton Roags Virginia we put about 180 million gallons of water back into the ocean every day. We have a population of about 1.8 million. To supplement its recycled water, California should establish desalinization water plants. Also, California might find it advantageous to change its life style and to repent.

Too bad Danny Straw (Strawman) is typical of the level of critical thinking we have in the world and especially in the USA. \nHas to turn things into Liberal/Conservative debate instead of being able to see beyond those limited thinking skills. \nHe ought to try to learn how to grow food (and spend less time on the net) to see how hard it is to do without water. \nGuess Danny hasn\u2019t watched Ken Burn\u2019s \u201cThe Dustbowl\u201d or he might be concerned that the Ogallal Aquifier will be depleted by 2050, so every part of the USA west of the Mississippi will be worse than the Dust Bowl of the 30\u2019s. \nGuess Danny ought to buy that one way ticket offered by illusionist Richard Branson for that colony on Mars. \nNot only is the cost of desalination going to make it prohibitive, but without energy to run the plants (fracking is imploding so the Obama fantasy of the USA being the Saudi Arabia of the world again was short lived) makes them a waste of effort, time and energy. \nHey, Danny, read \u201cGreen Illusions\u201d by Ozzie Zehner.

It is a huge producing state for avocados, lettuce, citrus, Napa Valley wine, pistachios and many other products. The drought will have a severe effect on California\u2019s produce. \nNot to mention. a lot of people will go thirsty, too. The whole West and Southwest is parched. The Colorado River\u2019s flow is way below normal. Los Angeles already has water restrictions in place. Las Vegas and Phoenix may be next . evoval \nBy their own admissions the science of cloud seeding is a factual reality. They can make it rain or they can make it not rain. If they have the technology to make it rain why aren\u2019t they? Because they\u2019re using the technology to stop it from raining. Look up at all those hi flying aircraft spraying everyday, even when the clouds are black and it looks like rains coming it doesn\u2019t. Turn off the spigot, dry everything up, destroy property values, buy up all the real estate dirt cheap then turn the spigot back on at a time of their choosing. Diabolically ingenious! DJohn1 \nCalifornia needs to follow the example of Israel. Using the water you got which is the Pacific Ocean. Use toilets that use little water. Up and down the entire Pacific Coast, figure out why rain is not coming. Then change the conditions causing the drought. Conservation might help in the planting of as many trees as is practical. Leaves from trees tend to preserve what water there is. Disney put together a project in which they drip feed water to plants. It needs to be put into place in California to preserve vegetation where possible. Everything done is accumulative and eventually it might even solve the problem. I look at it that it didn\u2019t just start suddenly. It has gone on for years. Now it is getting critical. The problem of drought will not go away suddenly either. It will take years to solve the problem. When natural things reverse then the state could end up flooded. Remember, who is really in charge. God can do miracles. California and surrounding areas needs to change. The change is going to be somewhat painful but necessary. There is some hidden cause that is preventing the rain from falling. That is what California has to discover before anything will work. jakartaman \nAn angry GOD on the sodimites Gay Veteran \nThe road of the Godly leads upward, leaving hell behind.

It is a much more efficient process and is totally viable. It does, however take up a lot of real estate, so the ocean water would need to be pumped into collectors in the desert, and the fresh water pumped back into the city. I think you were confused by the word powered. Either pay closer attention or try not to be so sanctimonious. Reminds me of a joke. What do you get when you cross Albert Einstein with a streetwalker?

Joe Burbinski \nWell look, if this drought is actually natural, what do you expect, the majority of California has always been a desert \u2026period. it has only developed for human habitation because they stole water from other parts of the nation.

Gay Veteran \nbilge from a tired old bigot Mark Odenbach \nHigh End Solar drought solution for The Golden State. \nThere is a technological solution to this problem. I don\u2019t even need credit for it, but it is my idea. \nThe three, one mile square solar concentrating steam generating, electric power stations that are operating along Interstate 15 south of the state line between CA and NV are the way out of this mess. The boilers need to be modified to use ocean/salt water and to continually wash the concentrated brine with fresh salt water so as not to clog the boiler with salt. An area of perhaps 50 square miles should be set aside in the low area of the southwestern central valley, where there used to be a lake and the farmland is not as good as elsewhere. The brine handling solar power generating plants should be built in this area with the already existing piping and canals from the delta used to supply them with salt water from further out into the ocean. The solar plants boil the salt water and use the steam to make power from the sun, which makes the \u201cGreenies\u201d happy; the steam from the turbines is then condensed into pure water with the cold salt water coming into the plant which is warmed up a bit; the continuous flow of highly concentrated brine flushed out of the boilers is placed into evaporation ponds for salt and other mineral mining operations. A small fraction of the power generated by the plants is dedicated to run the delta pumps, the remainder is injected into the grid. The fresh condensed water is piped throughout the central valley to eliminate the water shortages CA will be experiencing. This is basically, solar desalinization with many additional benefits. This system is scalable and even more value can be derived with new technologies and innovations. \nMark Odenbach \nI have a house in phoenix i can let someone buy for 700k frank1569 \nThere is only one solution: 1/2 the population needs to voluntarily move to another state ASAP.

Will this lack of water be used by the Obama administration to force other states to take in all these illegals? If this has been such a critical issue for decades why is the next desalination plant five years from completion? Where are California\u2019s priorities? Since so much domestic produce is grown in California why hasn\u2019t a pipeline of water been constructed from say water-rich Wyoming to supply the need? Certainly investors would pile into that project if there was really a need. I suspect the need is not that critical, or they would ban swimming pools at least. And I really believe the left wants to use this issue/crisis to further it\u2019s nefarious agenda of advancing man made global warming, and continue its wealth transfer schemes. Orange Jean \nWhat most surprises me is that California wasn\u2019t expecting this. They have always had a tenuous hold on water\u2026 with parts in the north often getting far too much at the same time as the south getting too little. \nThat\u2019s why they built (as who knows what cost) the CA Aqueduct system (which is how the Central Valley gets it\u2019s water for crops) as well as the flood control dams. That\u2019s why back in the late 80s (during a 5 year drought) they passed new plumbing ordinances requiring \u201clow flow\u201d toilets and showers. \nThat\u2019s why LA robbed the farmers of Owen\u2019s Valley of their water. That\u2019s why the St. Francis dam failed and killed over 500 people back in the 20s. And in East of Eden (set in Salinas, CA) Steinbeck wrote: \n\u201cAnd it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.\u201d JB \nNow that they have ruined their state, it looks like many of the Califonians are coming to Texas to drain it of everything, including water.

JWM \nThe hasn\u2019t been a natural weather pattern in this country for well over 20 years. All of America\u2019s weathe, and much of the globe has been manipulated, and is controlled. When California runs dry, it will cause a large designed population shift out of the State. Many farmers will quit due to lack of crop water. (Actually this is a ready happening to my own family). My Granddaughter just moved out of California with her husband and family. Her husband has lived in Cal. all his life. Now they live in Washington State (great for us). \nThis move out of California by the masses will allow big GMO food corporations to come in and buy up huge rich farming lands for pennies on the dollar, and that will eventually result in huge increase in food prices. Once done, the Government powers controlling the weather patterns will attempt to restore the ground water tables and weather in the state. The end result, more for the Corporations, and control by Government of the people. Control the water and you control the food, control the food and you control the people\u2026\u2026That\u2019s the end result, and a very simple plan.

I was only a matter of time before the water ran out. Even if the wet period had continued it was only a matter of time before reality reared it\u2019s ugly head. Now it California next it will Las Vegas, Phoenix, Reno so on. Walter Ruggieri \nAs long as jobs are here, people will stay and they will import water or finally build a desalinization plant. But\u2026 once the jobs dry up and real estate prices drop, they will begin to move in mass. Maybe other states need to begin to develop California migration contingencies? David Wilson \nTime to get serious, California. First thing I\u2019d do right now is make lawns illegal, unless they\u2019re made of plastic. And that includes parks, golf clubs and all those road side verges in suburbia. People should replace them with something more appropriate to a Mediterranean/semi-desert climate. If you don\u2019t get radical now the economy could implode in a few years time if the drought continues and water supplies run out. Philip Botwinick \nThe Israelis are also good at behaving towards the Palestinians much like the Germans/Nazis did towards the Jews prior to the implementation of the Final Solution in 1941. \nCan Israel function without the funds from the USA, the Christian Right and many of the fearful Jews? No. \nJust consider me a self hating Jew along the lines of Norman Finkelstein. Dan \nThey will likely try to make any conservatives stay and then redistribute the liberals to all the swings states\u2026.. SMH2much \nSo, where is the Calvary to rebuild our dams that were destroyed for the smelt? Richard \n\u201cAre you starting to understand the scope of the problem?\u201d No, actually I\u2019m not starting. I understood the problem a long time ago. How about a question for the likes of us? When you write those kinds of question, it just looks like fea-rmongering to me. The emotive, overwrought silly questions just assume we\u2019re fools. We ALL know how serious this is. We don\u2019t need to be asked if we\u2019re \u201cstarting\u201d to understand, thank you. Joel \n\u201cHow about a question for the likes of us?\u201d\u2014 Really? What about stopping using yourself as a reference of the good way of writing or speaking? Stop playing the Mother Teresa of the Grammar & Spelling World. Your comments are, as usual, out of context of the topic\u2026 you just want to show to all of us how great you are at using English\u2026 get over yourself. why bother \nI work and rent in Orange County, California. I notice Irvine is all green still. Is the Irvine Company immune from the water rules? I am a legal resident in Arizona and I cannot imagine where Californians could afford to go. They need jobs. Their employers would have to move first before the Californians can move. For instance, the national HQ of Toyota moved from California to Texas. Some other big corporation (I am not at liberty to say) employing at least 10,000 people in California has been talking about consolidating in Texas out of California in five years. I am thinking the plans might move quicker than five years, because of the severe drought. I have a place to stay in Arizona, but no job there. I do have a lot of savings because I prepared for crises, and am 12 years from retirement. So I can sit out a few years and find some way to make money again after the drought finishes off what the socialists destroyed in California. Philip Botwinick \nNot only is Irvine exempt, for the time being (I\u2019m being sarcastic), but big ag and big oil are completely exempt (this I\u2019m being serious about). \nGot to keep those walnuts growing. Discipleof Jesus \nAll those microchips and still don\u2019t know how to design a viable de dalizination plant ? See what happens when you trust in man California ? Gwen Johnson Koskinen \nWhen they have to migrate, maybe this time, when the Californians have to leave and go to Oklahoma, Oklahoma will welcome them with more hospitality than they were greeted with back in the 30s. MeMadMax \nAh heck, mexico wants california back, let em have it\u2026.. \nAs long as they get to keep all the libtards there too\u2026 \n^.^ Elmo Fudginputz \nWhy aren\u2019t a series of pipelines already under construction to move water from the Great Lakes to California and other states being effected by drought? Call it the Interstate Drought System, similar to the Interstate Highway System. Is everybody in California just stupid? All that water in the Great Lakes, and golf courses in California will soon be brown. And the amount of fresh water in Canada is staggering. Somebody out there should try and business develop a solution. Philip Botwinick \nYeah, that\u2019s right. The Great Lakes where fertilizer run off have created an algae situation. \nMy god where are the critical thinkers? Elmo Fudginputz \nCritical thinkers? Well you aren\u2019t one of them, notwithstanding your fantasy and personal problems. Algae situation? Almost all fresh waterer lakes have algae. Did you know most municipalities actually treat their water pathogens and impurities before sending it on to the public? They let folks like you over at Oaklawn sanitarium actually have access to computers? Briarpatch \nCritical thinkers\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026THAT\u2019S rich coming from you! Dave Wilbur \nThe solution for water in California. ALL accurate economic, gastronomic, medical, political and military thinking has to be based on government having unlimited funds while no money goes to Washington as taxes. How can this be? Nobel Laureate, Paul Samuelson said the Federal Reserve is an \u201comnipotent counterfeiter\u201d and the Federal Reserve in 1977 and 1979 said their system \u201cworks only with credit.\u201d They also said: \u201cThe Federal Reserve in cooperation with the federal government has the inherent power to create money. This power makes technical bankruptcy out of the question.\u201d They should just create whatever amount of credit needed to build sufficient desalinization plants to convert sea water to drinking water without use of taxes. The facts stated here make continuous wars possible. Let\u2019s stop the destructive wars and construct all of the pure water plants needed. Philip Botwinick \nLike that\u2019s really going to happen. \nGet real. nobody \nNice, you can\u2019t even paste a working link. Nevermind, i found your source by myself. But unlike you i checked who they are and surprise surprise, they are one of the mouthpieces of the industry. So yea, about that source, time for a new one unless you still want to be seen as a gullible moron. May i suggest the official government statistics? BTW, i thought that the picture on my account would be enough to clarify its origin, apparently you aren\u2019t smart enough for that. Oh well, nothing new here. Hart Shepherd \nBecause we all know how accurate and honest government statistics are. nobody \nYou probably don\u2019t, but the rest of us do. Priszilla \nCoors light is just like water, and cheaper too. Infidel51 \nCalifornia is chock full of amoral liberal d-bags so maybe this is a cosmic smackdown.

Philip Botwinick \nHaving know Mike personally I\u2019m well aware that he was not a supporter of LaRouche. \nThere are no solutions. We in the midst of the Sixth Extinction event, and that includes the species known as humans. The window closed back in 1972 despite what propaganda you hear. \nRemember, we\u2019d need 5 other planets like earth to provide a lifestyle that the average American lives for everyone on the planet. \nLook up Albert Bartlett on youtube as well as read Guy McPherson\u2019s Climate Change Summary. We\u2019re at over 40 feedback loops. \nMike interviewed Guy numerous times and deferred to him on Climate Change issues. Philip Botwinick \nYeah, that\u2019s right Ken show how much like the Dulles brothers you are. You do know that we overthrew a democratically elected government in Iran in 1953. \nMake this into a liberal/conservative issue. As if Nature gives a flying crap what you are. \nCome back when your taps run dry and ask me if I\u2019ll give you a drink from my well. I\u2019ll be holding a weapon at the time so what will you offer me for a drink of cool, wet, refreshing water. \nI\u2019ll let you turn the other cheek. Perez Piedad \nTake spanish lessons\u2026water\u2026. agua JulietteofOhio \n\u201cMoonbat\u201d strikes again. Maybe this will save the U.S. by diluting the power of the Looney Left. How nice not to have to care about what California thinks, and I use the term loosely. Hart Shepherd \nPhilip, followed the link and read the article. Seems like a valid reductionist point of view. However any dichotomy between free will and determinism is a false dichotomy at best as is all of existence. You just have to learn to take the good with the bad. As they say, every dying dog has it\u2019s day. John Blythe \nLet me tell you Michael about the situation in my home town of Lake Isabella which is just about 30 miles due northeast of Bakersfield, the most southern city in the central valley. Lake Isabella, once the largest lake in the southern California region with 40 miles of shoreline has become nothing but a puddle of water now. There are a few factors including the drought situation as well as the fact that the lake\u2019s main dam has to be retrofitted for state earthquake seismic requirements, however the lake levels have had a huge damaging affect on the local economy. Lake Isabella (sometimes referred to as Kern Valley if you count all eight towns that surround the lake) was a nice rural area and a getaway destination for city folks in L.A., Orange County and the Inland Empire. People used to love to come up to the lake every summer to wind surf, boating, jet ski, fish, camp etc.. We\u2019re also a popular tourist destination for European travelers because the lake is a gateway to the Giant Sequoia Tree Monument and Death Valley National Park which foreigners love to visit. \nBut now all that has drastically changed. The valley recently had its annual Lake Isabella Fishing Derby (one of the largest trout derbies in the U.S.) and admissions were down substantially which they anticipated anyway and last summer was some of the worst on record for local businesses and it is no doubt going to be an even worse summer season come June. Because the rapid decline in tourism and recreation that feeds the local economy every year, we now have a bigger problem: drug addicts and criminals are moving into the area. Even worse, because of Kern County\u2019s budget problems, Lake Isabella\u2019s police force has been drastically cut. In the last year, people have had their property vandalized, homes that have been broken into, property stolen. \nPeople who see the decline in tourism due to the lake level going down are now moving out of the area and their vacant homes they put up for sale are now being \u201cmoved in\u201d by squatters and meth addicts, as Kern County has a major meth epidemic. As a result, real estate companies in Lake Isabella are loosing money on homes that were originally valued for the market. I can\u2019t tell you how awful this has impacted a once quiet rural area and popular summer destination in Southern California. Its like Lake Isabella has become a \u2018mini version\u2019 of Detroit. Vacant homes are now decaying and crumbling, drug users are now out on the streets, we\u2019ve had a larger influx of transients and obvious criminals from Bakersfield and Delano that were released due to State budget problems with the penal system recently; and businesses that have been here for decades are now closing and moving out. The local police and even media in Kern County are reluctant to admit this stuff, in fact the police department I think is so ashamed of what has been happening lately, they seldom even report some of the most obvious drug busts or arrests that should be reported in the local papers, but they don\u2019t report, in fear of what the public would think. But the truth is, the public already knows what is really going on. Hart Shepherd \nYou think California is on the Atlantic ocean and we\u2019re stupid? Hart Shepherd \nAl Gore is a douchebag. AGW is a myth. Yes, the climate changes but the primary driver is the sun\u2019s movement around the periphery of the galaxy, and it looks more like we are heading for much colder temps than any of us have seen in our lifetimes. piccadillybabe \nToo bad they did not get on the desalinization band wagon a long time ago. If they had, they would have developed technology that produced beautiful pure water, was energy efficient and affordable by now. In America, we are real good at wasting our resources without thinking about the future. Chuck \nEveryone will eventually move out of california since they will will run out of all water. Hot Rain \nI\u2019ve been hearing this for 30 years. In Vegas we\u2019re always \u201cgonna run out of water\u201d. It was just political BS. There has to be a clever way to raise food prices. And water prices. Unfortunately, food commodities are now traded and investors want returns. That, coupled with weather anomalies around the globe will make basic food unaffordable. The Feds know all of this, that is why they hold off on raising interest rates. When interest rates start going up, food will shoot the moon. As will everything else. Scared Economist \nHave you taken a drive out to Lake Mead lately? Have you seen how low the water level is? And it\u2019s dropping further by the day. Steve Hansen \nPeople can move / migrate to another place, thats not the big problem! But California produce a lot of food they Export around the World\u2026 apeiron \nCan\u2019t the ocean water be de-salinized? Or is that one of those ideas that turn out to be more inputs than the output justifies? PaulPaterakis \nJerry Brown is spending fifty billion dollars on a Bullet Train to Nowhere but California hasn\u2019t built a new reservoir to conserve water in twenty years. \nCalifornia dumps fresh water into the ocean to keep San Francisco Bay from getting too salty and making the Delta Smelt uncomfortable. \nThis is a man-made disaster which has nothing to do with Global Warming. This is caused by liberal pressure groups electing incompetent liberal politicians. Andy Stunich \nPerhaps desalination plants? Probably too expensive other than for residential water.

LA ran out of water in the early 1900\u2019s but they kept building acquaducts and importing from the Colorado River as does Nevada and Arizona. This is the arid West and much inhabitable. In the end the earth always wins over mans folly. Rebel in Idaho \nthey could go back to mexico and take the liberals with them. quercus454 \nIt\u2019s the numbers. Something that the politicians can\u2019t seem to grasp. Immigration both legal and illegal is the driving force behind US population growth. Immigrants and their children are near 80% of California\u2019s increase of people. For every new added person it takes during their lifetime the development of 25 acres of undeveloped land. Those acres include expansion of waste facilities, infrastructure /roads/schools, consumer outlets, food production and increased government facilities. As one does the math, the amount of land needed to support the additional people becomes staggering. Increased numbers also drive up the cost of other dwindling resources. Energy, water, food, taxes also increase. Services like healthcare become stretched beyond their capacity. The ability of the US to increase it\u2019s population and sustain current levels of quality of life is impossible. California is the canary in the mine. If we do not stop the current rate of population growth, the US will see horrific conditions unheard of in this country before. Like a life boat, once filled to capacity, the addition of more people make conditions for everyone worse. Fat Hubie \nSeal the border of California and force them to move to Mexico\u2026!

WE ALSO have a really bad drought, NO SNOW PACKS, NO SNOW this year, and not enough rain to grow our crops.Our farmers are desperate, BUT I recommend that drought states start to regularly SEED OVER CAST CLOUDS to get rain! START to use science on the weather! WE HAVE THE SCIENCE. They seeded over cast clouds in the past to get rain; do it again. Science is far enough ahead, we can fiddle with the weather; California needs to use it\u2019s technology, and start getting rain, clouds, atmospheric changes and we KNOW the chemistry.Oregon in the Willamette Valley has much over cast clouds; make them rain! And CA, get your science companies to conjur up chemically made weather. It CAN be done. Tom \nWhy doesn\u2019t our government invest in plants that remove salt from ocean waters. Don\u2019t some mid East countries already do this? DixieAngel_76 \nI\u2019ve got a few questions for Governor Moonbeam, Lynn Wilson and the UN; first off, why are we allowing in new immigrants when there\u2019s not enough water for those of us who were here first? Second, will those people be the first to be made to leave, and will it be back over the border? Third, and most important is who gets to decide who leaves and who stays, and what happens to people who do not wish to leave their property behind? Fran \nSend them to Mexico! Nicholi Hel \nThe water situation should be exponentially worse in a few months as the mentally deranged politicians of California and this country allow a few million more Mexicans to swarm into the state. Nicholi Hel \nDo you think Nancy Pelosi will be fined for wasting water while washing the feet of illegal immigrants? She can wash my backside and gargle with the water, spit it into a bowl, then have it filtered and sold off to LA for drinking water. F$%K California. Colin Nunn \nI\u2019m wondering if any of the brainiac politicians have ever heard the word \u2018infrastructure\u2019 and if they did, ever considered the resulting strain on resources of mass immigration in the millions? Hey, Government, like DUH!!! Jessy S. \nThey can turn HARPP on and off on a whim. With that said, they tried getting water out to California, but that didn\u2019t happen. Joe \nI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be coming to where the water is. HAARP \nWhy doesn\u2019t the U.S. Government implement the HAARP program for weather manipulation? HAARP \nMake Mexico the 51st State! Randy Smith \nGive it back to Mexico. Lyla cavanaugh \nThe illegals are coming up here because there is a drought in Mexico. They won\u2019t be going back. They will be moving north. Lyla cavanaugh \nNo one will be leaving. The first thing is to stop all the high density housing that is being built. As soon as those new people turn on their taps and flush their new toilets its causing the situation to be worse for us all. Mary \nMy concern is what happens to desperate people who will be forced to migrate east- no jobs, no money. What happens to the communities and infrastructure of peaceful and relatively crime-free towns as these people descend upon them? Let\u2019s say only 10% leave Cali- that\u2019s still almost 4 million people looking for a new place to live. Who will leave- the richest or the poorest? What happens when a half million dollar home is now worth nothing? \nI imagine the poor have the least to lose, will hop on the California Zephyr et al, and start being deposited across the rest of the US. drleonus \nWhere are the savvy investors who will create the jobs needed to build three massive pipelines stretching across the country- this is a national problem after all \u2013 bringing snowmelt from the eastern seabboard, rain runoff from the midwest, and water from the Great lakes to dump all of it into the Lake Mead Sistern. The Pipelines will have giant logos on them, built from private investments funders: Koch Brothers, Google, Bill gates, Chevron,Netflix. Every state gets a chunk of the profits as the water passes through their states. Think of the billion of dollars invested and reaped from a massive project like this. Seems like a crazy proposition, no more crazy than a Las Vegas sucking up all the water to be an artificial city in the desert built on 1930\u2019s hubris? O, and powering our homes with water? That\u2019s go to stop immediately. Another 1930\u2019s infrastructural by gone way of doing things. Thankyou. It is time to solve this and stop jawing about it. robert hutchens \nLets face it, if there is a SEVERE water shortage and little drinking water, there will be chaos and riots. Anyone that says differently is living in a dream world. I havnt washed my car in three months, and YET I see MORONS washing their PRECIOUS car weekly! THOSE same morons will be the ones I TAKE from when the CHAOS and RIOTS hit. Stock up on Ammo AND firearms! MeJane \nThe so called mega drought is being advanced by the very same people as the climate alarmism community, which we know is more of a hoax and political movement of taxation and control than science. I\u2019d like to see the science used and I am sure it is \u201cclimate models\u201d, which are predictions and not reliable \u201cscience\u201d given the poor performance of climate models to date, we should be very skeptical of any climate modeling projections \u2014 and we certainly should not be basing any policy on the models. Plus a rainy winter \nI say this because I live in So. Cal and we had not even heard of this drought until two years ago and when we did it hear about it was touted \u201csuddenly\u201d by our very liberal Governor as \u201cthe worst drought in history\u201d. There is no doubt that the last four years had been dry but we\u2019ve had other periods that had been just as dry and for much longer without the hysterical doom saying. If the drought was so severe was the why didn\u2019t he insist on conservation when drought first began? Why is he NOT appropriating and supporting dam building that is already voted on as a priority over the idiotic and wildly expensive high speed rail if this were such a deadly emergency? Water is a necessity of life, railroads to nowhere are not, this does not add up. Plus we\u2019ve had a rainy winter and spring, but there is never a dent in the drought? Why aren\u2019t desalination plants going up, we are next to an ocean. Brown ordered mandatory water use reductions for the four year drought by 25 percent reduction on the state\u2019s 400 local water supply agencies, the state\u2019s agencies will be responsible for coming up with restrictions to cut back on water use and for monitoring compliance to enforce punitive measures, including FINES. Brown wants to fine big water wasters up to $10,000 per day. I have no problem with conserving and do so even when we aren\u2019t in a drought but something is off here when for 4 years this has been a problem but not one plan other than conservation and fines in the fourth year of a mega drought has been addressed or will be addressed. This is about revenue, alarmist global warming BS, we\u2019re in a drought, it is not the end of the world.

            "body": "CNN | 11/26/2022 | Listen\nA rail strike won't screw up your holidays. Here's how it'll affect you in other ways\nBy Chris Isidore, Vanessa Yurkevich and Matt Egan, CNN Business\n\nUpdated: Sat, 26 Nov 2022 16:35:02 GMT\n\nSource: CNN Business\n\nSo once again the nation and its economy is facing the risk of a massive freight railroad strike, this one as soon as Dec. 9. But about the only thing you don't need to worry about it is whether it will affect your holiday shopping plans. (It won't.)\n\nA prolonged rail strike could create all types of shortages, from gasoline to food to automobiles, and cause a spike in the prices of all types of consumer goods. It can screw up the commutes of tens of thousands of workers who take the train to work, slow the delivery of parts and force factories to shut down. But one area that most likely won't see immediate or severe disruptions will be Christmas.\n\n\"The stuff that needs to move for the holidays has already moved by rail,\" said Balaji Guntur, vice president in global consultancy Kearney's transportation practice and a logistics veteran. The goods that retailers are counting on for the holidays are already in stores or nearby warehouses.\n\n\"Christmas is not canceled,\" Brian Dodge, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, told CNN in a phone interview earlier this week. His group includes Walmart, Target, Home Depot and dozens of other major brands.\n\nA previous strike threat in September risked causing greater problems with goods slated for holiday sales, but that strike threat was averted by an 11th-hour tentative labor deal. But that strike threat is back, worrying shippers, after rank-and-file members of four rail unions rejected the earlier tentative deals. Negotiators for the two sides are back at the table.\n\nWhile the railroads say they are hopeful of reaching new deals, they have so far rejected the demands that union negotiators say their members want.\n\nA strike would \"would utterly upend the supply chain,\" Dodge said, adding that concern among retail CEOs is \"high\" because of the increasing risk of a national rail strike. About 30% of the nation's freight, when measured by weight and distance traveled, moves by rail, and there just isn't enough capacity on trucks or other modes to move those goods if the railroads grind to a halt.\n\nAnd a freight rail strike could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone, according to a new analysis from the Anderson Economic Group. \"Calculations show a first-day impact of approximately $60 million, including $30.9 million for lost freight, $3.8 million for long-term passenger rail disruption and $25 million in lost railroad industry wages,\" the analysis revealed.\n\nSecond and third day strike losses would increase to $91 billion per day because of lost agricultural goods and food spoilage. The costs would escalate from there.\n\nMany people expect Congress to intervene, either to order rail workers to stay on the job or quickly return to work if there is a strike, because of such severe economic ramifications.\n\nThe unions oppose Congressional intervention, saying the risk of a strike is the only way to get the railroads, many of which reported record or near record profits last year and will do so again this year, to make meet workers' demands for better working conditions, including sick pay policies common for most workers in other industries.\n\nBut if a strike starts, and stretches on, here's how it could affect other sectors, and many Americans:\n\nGasoline\n\nRefineries get most of their crude oil via pipelines and ship most of the products they produce, such as gas, diesel and jet fuel, via pipelines. Still, railroad tank cars are a key part of that process.\n\nJust about all ethanol that goes into gasoline moves by rail; gasoline wouldn't be compliant with some environmental regulations without it. But even if those regulations could be waived, the cost of a gallon of gas without ethanol would jump by about 16 cents due to the loss of tax breaks, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n\nPipelines carry most of the nation's crude oil to refineries, but each day about 300,000 barrels move by rail, a volume that would supply about two mid-size refineries, according to data from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refineries' trade group. Numerous chemicals used in the refining process also are transported via rail, as do some lower-grade products and waste materials.\n\n\"If rail cars aren't coming in regularly to pick up facility products, including the sulfur that refiners remove from crude oil, production will have to curtail,\" the refineries' trade group said earlier this fall.\n\nFood\n\nFood prices might not be as negatively affected by an early December strike date,as they would have been in September amid the fall harvest. But grain and other food products still need to move by rail.\n\nThat, coupled with low water levels on the Mississippi that have slowed barge traffic amid a Midwest drought, has the nation's agricultural industry very worried about possible strike.\n\n\"Any additional disruption of rail service would immediately impact the nation's food and agriculture and broader supply chains,\" said Mike Seyfert, CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association. \"The risk in both domestic and international markets is real.\"\n\nCars\n\nDecember is a major month for auto sales. But car and truck production is currently hampered by a shortage of numerous essential parts, most notably computer chips that in turn has created a dearth of vehicles available for sale on dealer lots. That's why car prices are now at record highs.\n\nBut that's nothing compared to what would happen with a prolonged rail strike. About 75% of completed cars built in US factories or imported here move by rail. So do many of the parts used to build vehicles, moving between suppliers and car assembly plants, and production will quickly halt if those rail links are severed. It would take time to make up for lost output, creating upward pressure on car prices.\n\nManufacturing\n\nMost factories aim to have parts and raw materials delivered right before they're used in assembly lines \u2014 a process known as \"just-in-time\" delivery. Many factories depend on rail to receive those parts and supplies and then ship out them out for delivery.\n\n\"We already face economic turmoil with rising costs, product shortages and high inflation. Any nationwide rail strike or shutdown will cause even more economic pain,\" said a statement from the National Association of Manufacturers earlier this month, adding that it's crucial that a strike be avoided.\n\nA lengthy rail strike could result in temporary plant closures, which is what happened across the global auto industry in recent years due to the shortage of parts and computer chips.\n\nCommuting\n\nOnly the nation's freight rail lines face a pending strike, but commuters would likely be affected, too. Many commuter trains travel on tracks maintained and operated by the freight railroads and passenger railroads expect they'll have to shut down their operations once the freight strike starts.\n\nAmtrak cut service on most of its long distance trains in the days leading up to the earlier Sept. 16 strike deadline deadline. The company owns roughly 700 miles of track, mostly between Boston and Washington, DC, but about 97% of its 22,000 mile nationwide system runs on freight lines.\n\nMany commuter railroads also move over freight rail lines and could not operate if a strike was called. That could mean more commuters driving to work, and more traffic and congestion even for those who don't normally take a train.\n\n\u00a9 2022 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company.

                              "text": "\"Just as fans were filing into the Brickyard 400 NASCAR race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a big television screen by the entrance displayed a pro-pot ad with the headline \"\"A new beer?\"\" The ad, which opens with smiling young adults hoisting their brew mugs, drew outrage from lots of sources, including the St. Petersburg-based Drug Free America Foundation. The TV screen company, Grazie Media, pulled the ad after a few hours. The ad said: \"\"If you\u2019re an adult who enjoys a good beer, there\u2019s a similar product you might want to know about, one without all the calories and serious health problems. Less toxic so it doesn\u2019t cause hangovers or overdose deaths. And it\u2019s not linked to violence or reckless behavior. Marijuana. Less harmful than alcohol and time to treat it that way.\"\" In this fact-check, we decided to focus on the idea that marijuana is \"\"less toxic\"\" than alcohol. \"\"I don\u2019t see how this could be a more open-and-shut case,\"\" Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which produced the ad, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. \"\"If you consume too much alcohol in a sitting or over the course of your life, you can die. If you consume too much (marijuana) in a sitting or over the course of your life, you do not die. What more could be needed to prove marijuana is \u2018less toxic\u2019 than alcohol?\"\" Yet, as a rebuttal, some health professionals say it\u2019s a matter of picking your poison. \"\"It\u2019s like trying to compare different weapons. Both have the potential to cause harm,\"\" said Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine, at University of Florida. \"\"I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a clear answer.\"\" For starters, the term toxic can be vague. Dr. Cynthia Lewis-Younger, medical director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Tampa, said toxic can be \"\"anything that causes harm. It is possible to drink enough water to poison yourself. It\u2019s more related to the dose than anything else.\"\" The Marijuana Policy Project\u2019s claim that marijuana is \"\"less toxic\"\" rankles some health professionals and anti-drug organizations who criticize the inference that using the drug is okay. Calvina Fay, executive director of the Drug Free America Foundation, said she wants the public to realize that \"\"these are two drugs that are both addictive and impairing and they both create unsafe situations.\"\" Briefly, here\u2019s a look at how the National Institute on Drug Abuse describes each drug. Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars and starches and while it may start as a stimulant in small doses, NIDA describes it as a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream. Intoxication can impair brain function and motor skills and heavy use can increase risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver disease. Marijuana is a dry, shredded green and brown mix of leaves, flowers, stems and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. The main psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. When marijuana is smoked, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the brain and other organs. Activists on both sides of the marijuana issue can find studies that back up their claims about the health impact of smoking weed. NIDA states in an email that the effect of marijuana can depend on the person (their biology) who\u2019s using it, the amount and under what circumstances. \"\"Claiming that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol cannot be substantiated since each possess their own unique set of risks and consequences for a given individual,\"\" according to an agency email statement. Statistics certainly paint a grim picture of the lethal impact of alcohol abuse. The Centers for Disease Control\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics reports that there were 41,682 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010, the last year with the most exact statistics. That breaks down to 15,990 deaths attributed to alcoholic liver disease and 25,692 other alcohol-induced deaths, excluding accidents and homicides. The center doesn\u2019t have any reports of marijuana listed as a cause of death. In 2006, there were more than 1.2 million emergency room visits and 2.7 million physician office visits due to excessive drinking, the CDC reports on its website. \"\"Alcohol in excess is probably the No. 1 cause of toxicities from drugs of abuse in the world simply because it\u2019s most widely used,\"\" Lewis-Younger said. Robert Gable wrote in an American Scientist article in 2006 that \"\"simply tallying the number of people who die or who show up at emergency rooms is, by itself, meaningless,\"\" because that figure is influenced by the number of people using the substance. Yet the Marijuana Policy Project\u2019s Tvert said Gable\u2019s eight-year study on recreational drugs bolsters their assertion. Gable, a retired professor of psychology at Claremont Graduate University in California, compared the toxicity of 20 abused substances using reports of experimental human and animal research and on published data of overdose fatalities. He compared the drugs by developing a safety ratio -- the ratio of an effective dose (eliciting a \"\"relaxed affability\"\") to a lethal dose. \"\"Two drinks makes you buzzy, 20 drinks puts you in the emergency room or the morgue,\"\" Gable said in a phone interview. \"\"Ten is the safety ratio\"\" for alcohol, among the most toxic recreational drugs, he said. The least physiologically toxic substances -- those requiring 100 to 1,000 times the effective dose to cause death -- included marijuana when ingested. He couldn\u2019t find any cases of documented deaths from smoked marijuana \"\"so the actual dose is a mystery.\"\" \"\"No drug is good for teenagers,\"\" he said, \u00a0\"\"but when it comes to the chances of immediate death by chemical toxicity, marijuana is about a hundred times less toxic than alcohol or cocaine.\"\" Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, notes: \"\"People could argue it (marijuana) is a weaker chemical in terms of toxicity, but it does have its consequences. It doesn\u2019t mean marijuana is harmless.\"\" Experts say one concern is the impact of marijuana on the brain, particularly for teens who start smoking early. Teitelbaum says marijuana can \"\"flip\"\" adolescents\u00a0predisposed to mental problems into having a psychotic disorder. A 2012 study from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King\u2019s College London and the University of Otago (New Zealand) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \"\"Persistent Cannabis Users Show Neuropsychological Decline from Childhood to Midlife,\"\" examined the potential relationship between the long-term use of marijuana and declines in IQ scores. The study was based on data from more than 1,037 individuals followed from birth until age 38 and determined those who began using cannabis before age 18 and became persistent users (more than once a week) suffered the greatest decline in mental functioning (an average of eight IQ points) that didn\u2019t improve once they stopped. Those who started using marijuana when they were adults didn\u2019t show the same decline. Another concern has come up in recent years. The use of synthetic marijuana, often called Spice, has become a problem,\u00a0and health professionals caution that it\u2019s vastly different from natural marijuana and more toxic. \"\"Many Spice smokers have experienced agitation, paranoia and mental illness,\"\" JoAnn Chambers-Emerson, certified specialist in poison information/educator at the Florida\u00a0Poison Information Center in Tampa, wrote in an email. \"\"Some Spice smokers have ended up having a stroke, heart attack, seizures and kidney failure. Synthenetic marijuana, however, is not marijuana. Our ruling An ad from the Marijuana Policy Project claims\u00a0marijuana is \"\"less toxic\"\" than alcohol. Our job as fact-checkers in this case is not to decide whether marijuana is good or harmful. We're focused on whether the drug in its natural form is \"\"less toxic\"\" than alcohol. In that regard, science and statistics present a strong case.\"",

                              "text": "\"On the night of April 22, 2011, Rep. Robert Watson, R-East Greenwich, was stopped at a Connecticut sobriety checkpoint and ultimately charged with both driving under the influence and marijuana possession. In a floor speech the following Tuesday, the then-House minority leader said he was not under the influence. He said he had not smoked marijuana, and his blood-alcohol level tested at 0.05, which is below the legal limit of 0.08. Watson told fellow House members he had \"\"a very small bag with trace amounts of marijuana and a smoking instrument.\"\" He was carrying the marijuana, he said, in case he had an attack of pancreatitis. \"\"I'm well aware that medical marijuana is a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition,\"\" he said in his speech, which garnered a standing ovation from Republicans and other House members at the time. (But a week later, the Republican caucus ousted him as minority leader.) Watson, citing personal privacy, has not released details of his medical record; results of his blood test will be the subject of his court hearing in Connecticut. But we wanted to weed out the facts on whether marijuana is actually recognized as a treatment for the pain of pancreatitis, an extraordinarily painful condition that Watson described as akin to a gunshot to the chest. First, some background. The pancreas, located behind the stomach, releases enzymes that aid in digestion. It also releases the insulin the body needs to control blood sugar. The enzymes flow out a tube into the small intestine near the stomach. Unfortunately, a portion of that tube is shared with the gallbladder. Sometimes tiny stones form in the gallbladder, migrate down the tube and block the portion that drains the pancreas. The result is painful inflammation -- pancreatitis. Doctors can usually see the stones with ultrasound or some other form of imaging. In those cases, either the stone eventually works its way free or doctors remove it. In either case, doctors urge patients to have the gall bladder removed. End of problem. The second major cause of pancreatitis is alcohol. When that's the case, doctors insist that patients abstain from drinking because one attack can lead to others, damaging the pancreas in a way that leads to chronic pancreatitis. \"\"The recommendation is pretty much to not take any alcohol because alcohol is a toxin to the pancreas,\"\" said Dr. Alyn Adrain, a gastroenterologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Brown University. Heavy smoking may also increase the risk, said Dr. Vikesh Singh, director of the Pancreatitis Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. That risk can be difficult to tease out because smoking and drinking often go hand in hand. Pancreatitis can also be caused by inherited deformities in the pancreas. There have also been at least two studies covering four patients suggesting that marijuana, by itself, can cause a pancreatitis attack. In other instances, doctors have trouble pinpointing a cause. Watson politely declined to answer most questions about his condition, saying he believes his health should be a private matter. Watson did, however, reveal elements of his illness during his speech on the floor of the House. He said his initial attack of pancreas pain was at Halloween. He said he went to the hospital the next day, where he had a severe reaction to a drug, prompting doctors to put him in a medically induced coma for five days. He said he subsequently had other attacks. He did not disclose the number and severity. \"\"I did treat with medical marijuana on one of those rare occasions where I had that debilitating pain that had me flat on my back\"\" wondering whether to call an ambulance, he said. He also reported having a recurrence the day before his arrest, but said he did not use marijuana then. Watson said that when he tried the drug, \"\"it provided relief and it alleviated the pain . . . I believed it was responsible self-therapy.\"\" Watson said he had not applied for authorization to use medical marijuana. But is marijuana \"\"a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition,\"\" as he contends? As a treatment for pancreatitis pain, let's be blunt. The simple answer is \"\"No.\"\" Both Doctors Singh and Adrain said there are no studies in the medical literature showing that marijuana is an effective treatment for the pain of a pancreatitis attack. \"\"There is no reason to use marijuana for acute pancreatitis,\"\" said Singh. \"\"There are no studies evaluating the use of cannabis for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain.\"\" \"\"I've never given it for chronic pain from pancreatitis and I don't know anyone who has,\"\" said Adrain. When we contacted Watson, he said his statement should be considered in the context of treatment for severe pain in general. The state's guidelines for medical marijuana use say \"\"qualifying debilitating medical conditions\"\" include \"\"a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment\"\" that produces any of six conditions, including \"\"severe, debilitating, chronic pain.\"\" In that context, the doctors we interviewed said marijuana MIGHT be useful in some cases, just as the drug helps some patients cope with cancer pain. \"\"It might help. There's just no good evidence to prove it\u2019s worthwhile,\"\" said Singh. Finally, we looked to Canada, where the use of medical marijuana has been legal for years. Health Canada, which authorizes medical marijuana use, lists seven conditions -- multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or disease, cancer, HIV, epilepsy, severe arthritis -- where the use is routinely accepted. For other conditions, a specialist must confirm \"\"that conventional treatments have failed or [are] judged inappropriate to relieve symptoms.\"\" And Dr. Mark Ware, associate medical director of the McGill University Health Centre Pain Clinic in Montreal, told us in an email that pancreatitis is a different kind of pain. \"\"This is a visceral pain syndrome and most cannabis studies have focused on neuropathic pain.\"\" The personal reports you can find on the web \"\"have not been validated or evaluated.\"\" So as far as we could determine, it's neither recognized nor recommended by the medical community for this use. There are certainly no studies to support its use.\"",

                              "text": "A blog with a pattern of publishing false and misleading stories about Canada claimed that a nationwide crackdown on public drinking and cannabis smoking was imminent in that country. In June 2019, Canada-Eh.info published a post with the headline, \u201cCanadians Can Be Fined $1,500 for Drinking or Smoking Weed in Public, Starting Next Month,\u201d which reported that: \u201cMayors are considering to bring [sic] this [sic] new tougher laws in every province of Canada, you will no longer will be able to consume alcohol or smoke weed responsibly in parks or on beaches. Fines vary from province to province, but they can be up to $1,000 in in provinces like British Columbia and Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador.\u201d The report continued on to say: \u201cIf you get caught with open alcohol in Toronto right now, you could face a fine of up to $125 and a whopping $230 in Vancouver. Tougher rules are coming for most people who like to consume alcohol or weed in public. Starting next month if you are caught drinking beer or smook [sic] weed in public, the police will pour out your alcohol and make you pay a fine $1,500.\u201d As has been the case with previous Canada-Eh stories we have examined, the claims here were at times ambiguous and confusing. More broadly, the narrative of an imminent nationwide crackdown on public drinking and smoking in July 2019 \u2014 \u201cnew tougher laws in every province of Canada\u201d \u2014 was false. As was the case with previous stories, Canada-Eh republished an almost-identical version of the post just two days later, on 12 June. Canada has no uniform nationwide policy on public alcohol consumption or cannabis use. Policies are determined by provincial governments or municipal authorities in individual cities and towns throughout the country. Most cities and provinces have historically prohibited public drinking (which belies the article\u2019s claim about a new crackdown on such behavior), but Canada\u2019s legalization of cannabis in 2018 prompted some governments to rethink their approach to drinking in public places, as the Canadian Press reported: As all corners of the country prepare for a seismic shift in how and where people consume marijuana, several cities are considering whether it would make sense to legalize drinking alcohol in parks as well \u2014 a move an expert said would bring antiquated laws in line with the way people already behave. \u201cI think a lot of people who want to have a bottle of wine in a public park on a Sunday are probably going to be doing that anyway,\u201d said Mitchell Kosny, interim director of Ryerson University\u2019s School of Urban and Regional Planning. The idea of legalizing alcohol in parks and on beaches has come up in Toronto and Vancouver, both of which are in the midst of municipal elections and both of which are in provinces that will allow people to toke in public come Oct. 17. Kosny said he suspects the idea is floating around now because election candidates and front runners may want to appear \u201copen-minded.\u201d Toronto Mayor John Tory floated the idea at an event Thursday, pointing out that it would seem counterintuitive to allow people to smoke pot in parks but not drink a beer \u2014 especially since people are already bringing wine and beer to their picnics. In Ontario, for example, smoking or vaping in any workplace or enclosed public place is prohibited, with the punishment ranging from a $1,000 fine for the first offense to $5,000 for subsequent offenses. However, the ban doesn\u2019t extend to smoking or vaping in open-air public spaces. While the province of Ontario had traditionally banned drinking alcohol in public, the government\u2019s 2019 budget, launched in April 2019, introduced a new tailgating permit to allow public alcohol consumption at certain sporting events and introduced a measure that would allow cities within Ontario to designate public areas, such as parks, for alcohol consumption. By contrast, authorities in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, moved in 2018 to ban smoking on all public municipal properties such as roads and sidewalks, even in open air. As a further illustration of how complex the interaction of provincial and municipal authority in Canada is, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s provincial government introduced legislation in February 2019 that would prohibit public cannabis use but later reportedly resiled from those plans after the mayor and police chief in Montr\u00e9al declared the regulations would be unenforceable.",

                              "text": "\u00a9 Provided by Fool  Recent quarterly results from Molson Coors Brewing Co.(TSX:TPX.A)(TSX:TPX.B)(NYSE:TAP) and Anheuser Busch Inbev NV (ADR)(NYSE:BUD) have indicated a continuation in the recent trend of a softer North American beer market.  Is this indicative of a potential shift in changing consumer preferences and the more widespread adoption of recreational cannabis as a substitute for alcohol products?  If so, what are the potential implications on the alcohol and marijuana markets?  People are drinking less beer in North America  First-quarter results out of two of North America\u2019s largest alcohol beverage makers show an alarming trend in what appears to be a slowdown in beer consumption in the Canadian and U.S. markets.  In the first quarter, Molson saw a 5.8% decline in sales to the United States along with a 2.5% drop-off in shipments to Canadian markets.  Meanwhile, AB Inbev, which owns the Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Corona brands, experienced a similar fate in its first quarter, reporting 2.3% softer sales than it experienced in the U.S. a year ago.  Granted, some of the weakness can probably be attributed to the growing popularity in recent years of \u201ccraft brews,\u201d often locally owned and operated breweries that are run on a much smaller and \u201cgrassroots level.\u201d But that theory, however, fails to account for what Molson referred to as a \u201csofter-than-anticipated start\u201d for the U.S. beer industry as a whole.  This leads one to believe that if North Americans as a whole are consuming less alcohol, is that because they\u2019re smoking more \u201cpot\u201d instead?  The case of marijuana as a substitute for alcohol  The best case that could be made to \u201cput down the pint and pick up the pipe\u201d would have to be the purported health benefits of marijuana.  Case in point being that even in advance of the drug becoming legal for recreational purposes, it is already being prescribed for a whole host of medical applications from treatment for multiple sclerosis to seizure disorders and Chron\u2019s disease.  Contrast that to alcohol, which carries with it all kinds of detrimental side effects, like cancers and liver disease, and given how health-conscious society is becoming, it\u2019s easy to see how people could be coerced to make the switch from alcohol to pot, or at the very least begin practicing a more \u201cbalanced\u201d approach to their recreational activities.  The implications for alcohol and marijuana stocks  Whether that story ends up playing out or not, there\u2019s reason to believe that it may be in the alcohol industry\u2019s best interests to get ahead of the curve, so to speak, and hedge their bets.  After all, it\u2019s estimated that by the beginning of the next decade, the market for cannabis products in Canada could be as large as the beer market today.  When you view this picture through the lens of management at companies like Molson Coors and AB Inbev then, you can see how making an investment in the marijuana industry might help them save their jobs in five or 10 years\u2019 time.  If you don\u2019t think this is a very real possibility, you needn\u2019t look any further than Constellation Brands, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:STZ) US$245 million investment in Canopy Growth Corp.(TSX:WEED) last year.  Bottom line  With legalization expected for later this year, M&A activity has already started to heat up in the sector.  That includes Aurora Cannabis Inc.\u2019s (TSX:ACB) purchase of CanniMed earlier this year for $1.23 billion, and, more recently, rumours that Aurora is in talks to acquire MedReleaf Corp. (TSX:LEAF).  But if the alcohol companies are going to act, they had better act fast.  The marijuana industry is expected to grow in excess of 20% annually through at least 2020, meaning that the price they\u2019ll have to pay for one of Canada\u2019s licensed pot growers will only get steeper from here.

According to a study from auto club giant AAA\u2019s safety foundation, a blood test threshold for THC \u2014 the chemical component of cannabis that makes people \u2018high\u2019 \u2014 is simply not scientifically possible. \nYet, in five of six states where cannabis is legal, the tests are used to determine whether or not drivers should be considered impaired. Those tests employ a blood level-based judgment similar to that used for determining alcohol impairment. But AAA found such tests for THC are wholly unreliable \u2014 sending potentially unimpaired drivers to jail and putting impaired drivers back behind the wheel. \n\u201cThere is understandably a strong desire by both lawmakers and the public to create legal limits for marijuana impairment in the same manner we do alcohol,\u201d said AAA president and CEO, Marshall Doney, as reported by the Associated Press . \u201cIn the case of marijuana this approach is flawed and not supported by scientific research.\u201d \nAfter discovering the tests had no value, the safety foundation recommended Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington simply ditch their THC impairment testing laws \u2014 and that other states considering similar laws abandon the proposed legislation. \nAs the study notes, determining actual impairment from THC consumption is quite different than for alcohol. Tolerance for the chemical would mean though a regular cannabis user might have high blood levels of THC, they are perfectly safe behind the wheel \u2014 while a relatively low THC blood level could be found in someone unfit to drive. \nInstead of what amounts to arbitrary blood testing, AAA recommends specialized law enforcement officers who would better observe behavior as a determination of impairment, which would then be backed up by THC blood testing. \nAs the AP noted, nine states \u2014 even some with legalized medicinal cannabis \u2014 currently have zero-tolerance policies in place for THC-impaired driving. Those states\u2019 laws include not only blood testing for THC, but also for its metabolites which can persist in blood long after the last use of cannabis. \nObviously, explained New York University professor and specialist in drug issues and criminal policy, Mark A. R. Kleiman, such laws make no sense. \n\u201cA law against driving with THC in your bloodstream is not a law you can know you are obeying except by never smoking marijuana or never driving,\u201d he explained. Kleiman, however, disagrees with AAA\u2019s recommendation to adjust current laws, and instead feels such offenses should by traffic violations. \nAccording to Kleiman, compared to other potentially dangerous impairments, cannabis is likely the least offensive on the list. While some studies showed roughly double the risk of accidents caused by cannabis impairment, nationally-legal hands-free cellphone usage quadruples the crash risk \u2014 and blood alcohol content of .12 increases accident risk 15-fold. \nA \u201cnoisy child in the back of the car\u201d presents the same increased dangers as driving under the influence of cannabis, Kleiman said \u2014 noting an exception would be use of both cannabis and alcohol together, which would greatly increase impairment. \nClearly, ineffectual and illegitimate laws that senselessly send people to jail need to be abandoned with a quickness \u2014 and the AAA safety foundation\u2019s findings on THC blood impairment testing would be a fantastic place to start. Share \nThis is really OLD news. They should have read this: http://www.bisdro.uni-bremen.de/boellinger/cannabis/09-robbe.pdf zimbo \ngood link, but older than this. the fact that interested people from along the whole world expect news in studies and decisions based on founded experiences to cannabis and society makes this \u201ckind of new\u201d : \u201cnow we know that we knew it before, but we didnt believe\u2026\u201d. all the studies in europe are hard work because of \u201cillegalitity\u201d. as only holland has a moderate view on that and a few countries like portugal or poland have anti criminal laws for owning a few gram, there is almost no way for good representative studies, except for medical science. thats why this 1994 study from holland is so important, and is translated in a big interpretation range along europe. The federal comission (same that was asked for 1ng level in 2002) tried to uplift the level to 3ng this january, due to later sciences, but was not succesful. relevant science of countries with \u201clegalisation\u201d is important for other countries, and such statements from the aaa too, as it comes from big brother u.s., thats always a door opener, holland science isn t so much for lobby germoney marianne \nIt\u2019s not about making sure people aren\u2019t impaired, it was never about that. It\u2019s just yet another means of trying to screw over anyone who breaks stupid prohibitionist drug laws. From that perspective, the law makes perfect sense. Michael \nThis is only a surprise for the people who have never experienced or used marijuana. 2 hours after you smoke it, you\u2019re as good as new most of the time. Sometimes it last a little longer but not very often especially if its mexican ditch weed. It has to be really good strain to last any longer than 2 hours. However, if you ingest it there is a longer buzz. It takes an hour or so after you ingest it to begin the buzz. \nAgain, marijuana is far far far more safe to use and understand how to use, than alcohol. If you wanna make your life better stop drinking alcohol which will definitely kill you and smoke a doobie, relax and enjoy the music knowing that what you just put in your body will NOT kill you.. marianne \nTo be fair, alcohol isn\u2019t all that deadly if used in moderation. Moderate consumption even has some health benefits. I mean it\u2019s certainly a drug with the potential to be very dangerous if misused, more so than most illegal drugs, but drinking alcohol won\u2019t definitely kill you (though it very well might if you overuse it). William Carmichael \n\u201cTo be fair, alcohol ISN\u2019T ALL THAT DEADLY if used in moderation.\u201d LOL! What a statement. marianne \nTrue enough, I did phrase that in a somewhat amusing way! Elizabeth Pallett \nOr you could try eating it to ensure good health, mental and physical, smoking has a very short term effect even for pain, ingesting has far more benefits and is better for you too. JD Salinger \nThe point of the article is getting tested for impairment. If you eat it you still have thc in your system. You can still get popped. The article says the tests are unreliable are unscientific. But thanks for your view on edibles anyway. mantirig41 \nI know I am a much kinder diver when stoned. Sober I drive like a bat out of hell Chris Sky \nLaws aren\u2019t about \u201cThe Greater Good\u201d they are about MONEY and CONTROL for the people in power. AlPennG \nWE NEED ACCESS TO THE WHOLE PLANT SO WE CAN LIVE A WHOLE LIFE!! PERIOD!! THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PROFIT IN IT SO THAT HAS TO BE BAD!! THAT IS THEIR THINK ON EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING ALL BULLSHIT THEY KEEP SHOVELING!! WE CRY, WE DIE AND THE POLITICIANS LIE!! zimbo \ninteresting. to drive drunk and stoned is no option for me, and i appreciate possibilities to keep people away from driving a car as long as they are not able to. the question about how to find out, the level and penalty in other countries brought me here.I heard about colorados level of 10ng thc/ml serum. for german administration law you are \u201cunable impaired\u201d for car and bike with 1ng thc/ml serum, thats up to 24h after a 34mg joint. or 75 ng thc metabolites /ml serum; or a official witness for using car or bike within 12h after smoking joint (telling this in wrong environment can be enough) you loose your license and begin a half or one year psychological and medical odyssey for a 50/50 chance to get it back. (for blood alcohol the level is 1,1). psychologists earn a lot of money with that. in switzerland, you may drive trolley car with up to 3ng/ml serum- as operator. both laws based on the 1994 limburg university study by h.w.j. robbe, also posted below. As there is no succesful way to criminalize people with a joint or a bit cannabis by criminal law in germany due to high \u201ccosts for nothing\u201d, the admin.law is misused, and you can loose your license even by smoking in a park or carrying 3 joints in a taxi. Finally i like the link to the noisy backseat kids. interesting: this year several people lost their lives getting involved in accidents by spontaneous street races. as the license is older than 2 years, the drivers get it back automatically after 1 -3 months. there is no significant statistic on marihuana caused accidents. in combination with alcohol there are. every known european study say that marihuana leads to defensive and careful appearances, while alcohol leads to aggresive and overestimational behaviour. beer is an huge economical factor here, followed by pharmaceutics, which are not further considered in such discussions. \non a tv documentation of german truckers they talk in every way about all kind of pharmaceutics taken before while and after their hard job\u2026 Misty Trenshaw \nhttp://sprout.news/cops-confess-people-drive-better-when-they-are-high/#wysija \nSo, what\u2019s the problem? You stop at a stop sign and wait for it to turn green? You\u2019re overly cautious? A good driver? It\u2019s all about government control. \nI divorced my parents because of control when I was 17. I divorced my ex husband because of control when I was 32. I think it\u2019s high time we divorced our government. BarleySinger \nunfortunately, all over the world people are in abusive relationships with their governments Kokopelli \nWeed causes people to drive more slowly & more cautiously. Alcohol makes people drive faster & more recklessly. BarleySinger \nThe inability to account for \u201cTolerance\u201d isn\u2019t specific to cannabis. Is is true for nearly every intoxicant. It *very* true about alcohol. The cytochrome p450 system is different for every person. There is no simple roadside testing method in existence that can prove impairment.

In November, a $25,000 diamond ring reportedly flew from Beckham\u2019s finger while he was on the dance floor, never to be seen again. Sin City owner Gus Drakopoulos is pictured with Odell Beckham (left) and rapper 50 Cent (right) in undated photos. In 2012, a dispute between at the club between the entourages of Drake and Chris Brown later erupted into a brawl at a downtown dance spot that included shattered champagne bottles and tossed martini glasses. \nMeanwhile, former club employees say the joint often draws gang members and other troublemakers intent on settling beefs and brawling. \nKonstantine (Gus) Drakopoulos, who describes himself as the club\u2019s \u201cBossman,\u201d is a convicted white-collar felon. \nHe has employed an ex-con who did 10 years for manslaughter as a kind of intermediary with gang members to keep the peace, according to records and sources. \nThat man is now in prison for selling cocaine out of the club and carrying a loaded gun. Drakopoulos also had a retired NYPD inspector on the payroll . \nEven though it has been plagued by drug sales, gang activity, shootings, fights and allegations of prostitution, Sin City seems beyond the reach of cops, the State Liquor Authority, and local politicians. Community leaders see the fleshpot as coated in Teflon. \nAnd with good reason. \nDespite high-profile drug arrests at the club in June, the SLA renewed Sin City\u2019s license as it slogs on in its review, now in its eighth month. \nThe NYPD, meanwhile, quietly settled after suing to shutter the club for being a \u201cplace where individuals gather to engage in criminal activity.\u201d \nDrakopoulos, his lawyers, and a manager have denied wrongdoing, and say criticism of Sin City is unfair and misguided. They argue that it\u2019s a beacon of employment in the economically struggling South Bronx with an unparalleled security operation. \n\u201cAll we are is one of the largest employers in the South Bronx with over 100 employees who try to maintain good relationships with our local authorities and the community,\u201d Drakopoulos told the Daily News. \u201cYou can take that and twist it any way you like.\u201d \nA lawyer for Drakopoulos initially indicated interest in allowing The News to interview Drakopoulos more fully, but then backed away. \nEnter Sin City. CORSETS & COGNAC \nThe club inhabits a warehouse once used for car auctions in a heavily black and Hispanic neighborhood long afflicted by crime, unemployment, pollution, and high rates of asthma. \nCustomers line up under a ruby awning, next to a sign on the wall that reads \u201cno hats, hoodies, baggy jeans, sagging jeans, sweats.\u201d Sin City from the outside, after an August 2016 raid. (Gardiner Anderson for New York Daily News) \nPast the imposing doors, patrons pay $20 and go through metal detectors and across a large burgundy carpet to sit on red velvet banquets or black chairs around little tables under the glow of pink-purple lights and booming rap music. \nPatrons go to a booth to change large bills into singles taken from the office safe and piled in thick stacks. Ultimately, the singles find their way into strippers' G-strings. The club takes a cut of $1 out every $20 for the change-making service. \nA smoking room, which is barred under city ordinance, has often been available to customers, and until recently a bathroom attendant sold loose cigarettes as he handed out paper towels, State Liquor Authority transcripts show. A post shared by SinCityCabaret (@sincitycabaret) on Feb 5, 2017 at 5:46pm PST \nThe crowd is a mix of men in camo hoodies and backward caps and others who look like they had just sat for a GQ magazine shoot. \nThey munch on $19 pineapple shrimp and $28 T-bone steaks, drink $13 Hennessy Sweet Tea cocktails and can plunk down $2,200 for a Jeroboam of Krug Brut Cuvee or $4,000 for a bottle of Louis XIII de Remy Martin cognac. \nWomen in black and gold corsets with skin tight black shorts pour drinks behind the bar, as strippers gyrate on little stages or prowl the club looking for $20 \u201cplus a tip\u201d lap dances. \nSome dancers can make $1,000 to $2,000 a night, and the waitresses, or \u201cbottle girls,\u201d can take home $600 nightly, according to former employees who spoke with The News. \nThe dancers kick in $30 to $150 a night to work there, the former employees said. The interior of the Sin City Cabaret. (Norman Y. Lono for New York Daily News) \nNightly revenue for the club itself ranges from around $13,000 on a typical Tuesday to close to $60,000 on a Saturday night, according to internal records obtained by The News. Annually, the figures suggest that Sin City takes in roughly $11 million - not including what the dancers and waitresses make. ADVERTISEMENT \u2018THIS IS HEDONISM\u2019 \nIn a club awash in cash, five former employees \u2014 with a combined 20 years of Sin City experience \u2014 separately described a Wild West environment where just about anything could happen, where just about everyone hustled for money. \n\u201cThat place is hedonism,\u201d said one of the former workers. \u201cWhat goes down there is insane.\u201d A post shared by SinCityCabaret (@sincitycabaret) on Feb 5, 2017 at 7:51pm PST \nA former waitress says she started wound up at Sin City by responding to an ad in Craigslist. While already working a day job, her role at the club was to flirt and upsell customers on alcohol. On many nights, she ended up with $600 in wages and tips. \n\u201cYou get the hood, because you\u2019re in the Bronx,\u201d she said. \u201cWannabe rappers. But a lot of my customers were corporate guys. You had to have tough skin not just because you're working in a strip club but because of the harassment from some of the managers. A lot of times it was unprofessional.\u201d \nWhile she says she never let customers get too close to her, other women blurred the lines. \n\u201cI can't knock any of the women...it\u2019s what they have to do,\u201d she said. \u201cSome managers will stop it, and some won\u2019t.\u201d \nA former dancer said she started at the club at around 18. \u201cYou can make so much money in there, you kind of get lost in the money.\u201d \n\u201cA lot of people ask me why, but my back was against the wall,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to help take care of my family. You can make so much money in there, you kind of get lost in the money.\u201d \nAs for other dancers, she said: \u201cA lot of them had just come to America and needed money. Some girls just wanted to get high. Some girls had pimps.\u201d \nWhile the money was great, she said that she too suffered from harassment by some managers. In one incident, she said a manager grabbed her face when she rejected his advances. In another, she says a manager demanded she pay him bribes to continue dancing. \nShe said the stress of the constant harassment was tough on her: \u201cThe crazy thing is that I used to never ever drink. I started drinking at 22. One of my customers started me drinking. I was dancing sober for years. And it eventually became a problem I had to overcome.\" \nShe has since moved on from the life and has a new career. \n\u201cI\u2019ll probably never get married,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the dancer\u2019s curse.\u201d A HISTORY OF MELEES \nThe odor of marijuana was often strong in the club, a former employee said, but the bouncers frequently ignored it to avoid confrontations. \nThe bouncers had reason to be nervous. In 2011, bouncer James Britt was slashed by patrons while breaking up a fight, according to his lawsuit. \nHe needed staples in his head and stitches in his neck. A second bouncer, Wilfredo Delgado, was slashed on the nose in the same fight. Britt\u2019s lawsuit settled in 2015 for an undisclosed sum. \n\u201cGuards got about $110 a night, so it\u2019s not worth getting into a situation over weed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have like 600 people in there and 15 bouncers, and five of them are at the door. That\u2019s just not enough to control a crowd that size.\u201d \nHe said violence was so routine at times that it was only notable when someone got seriously hurt. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t safe to work there at all,\u201d said a former bouncer. \u201cThere was one time when a guy shot a gun outside the club, and he was later allowed to come back in.\u201d \nConsider what happened April 29 2015. A brawl erupted in the club just after 2 a.m., according to court records in a case brought by one of the combatants. \nWhen security tried to grab one of the men, he ripped free and waded, screaming, back into the fight. Another patron threw a chair into the melee. Dozens of customers ran outside to avoid the violence. \u201cThere was one time when a guy shot a gun outside the club, and he was later allowed to come back in.\u201d \nOn a different night, 20 gang members took on the bouncers and smashed a metal barricade through the front door, two former employees said. \nOn Christmas Day 2013, a drunk man blasted the front door with a gun after getting kicked out . \n\u201cI\u2019ve seen stabbings, shootings,\u201d a former employee said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people come out of the bathroom all cut up. I\u2019ve seen mobs destroy the place, the cops wouldn't come for half-an-hour and it never made the news. They would just send everyone home and lock the door.\u201d \nPatrons included members of the drug-dealing \u201cSex, Money Murda\u201d gang, which terrorized the Soundview section of the Bronx with violence for years, two former employees said. \n\u201cThey would start fights and I would ban them, and then they would be let back in, even though the bosses knew they were out of control,\u201d a former manager says. \nFrom Jan. 1, 2016 to Thursday, cops responded to 137 calls to the club for incidents ranging from possible crimes to fights to injured people, the NYPD said. ADVERTISEMENT TRAIL OF LAWSUITS \nSin City has had more than its day in court. \nA News review found at least 38 lawsuits against the club in state and federal court \u2014 including 20 filed by people allegedly beaten, shot or slashed by other patrons and four by people who claimed they were beaten by club security. \nTysheema Brown said she was at the club with two friends on May 6, 2016 at about 2 a.m. \nTwo women at an adjacent table glared at her, and then jumped her, punching her in the head, according to the police report. \u201cThey were beating her for five minutes and no one came over.\u201d \nOne of the women allegedly smashed Brown in the head with a hookah lamp. Cops arrested two women. \n\u201cThey were beating her for five minutes and no one came over,\u201d said Brown\u2019s lawyer, Laurence Savedoff. \u201cThese girls were creating trouble all night. There's a real lack of security there, and they let in questionable characters.\u201d The Sin City parking lot, where strippers and bouncers were arrested for cocaine sales July 2016. (Michael Schwartz for New York Daily News) \nBrown has sued for $15 million. The case is pending in Bronx Supreme Court. \nCamron Golphin alleged in a suit filed in Bronx Supreme Court that he was slashed in the face at a St. Patrick's Day party in 2015. \nHis lawyer, Michael Roitman of Frekhtman and Associates, said that the episode happened during a \u201cmidget boxing\u201d match in which the club set up a ring and brought in little people to fight. \nHe alleges Golphin was slashed in the culmination of events that included Sin City\u2019s serving a customer too much liquor and allowing the slasher to get a blade past metal detectors. \nThe club sued the man who slashed Golphin, and the case is still pending. \nNathan Medina filed a similar claim as a result of a fight in which he says he was slashed with a box cutter. His lawyer lawyer Gary Fish alleged that metal detectors weren't working that night, \n\u201cApparently, the man wasn't satisfied with the lap dance he got and he lashed out both metaphorically and physically,\u201d Fish said. The case is pending. \u201c...the man wasn't satisfied with the lap dance he got.\u201d \nAttorneys for the club have alleged in court papers that Medina was to blame for his injuries. The case is still pending. \nIn 2015, Samuel Thrower sued the club in Bronx Supreme Court for failing to provide adequate security, stemming from an incident in which a friend was mugged in a club bathroom and he was shot in the shoulder in the parking lot. The suit is pending. \nThe club denied any misconduct and asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed. \nSin City has also been hit with at least five employment-related court actions. \nIn 2010, six cocktail waitresses alleged a pattern of verbal and physical sexual harassment. \nIn one instance cited in the lawsuit, manager Kevin Wells allegedly stuck a dancer's foot in his mouth. Another plaintiff claimed Wells stuck his finger in her buttocks, and a third claimed he routinely squeezed her rear hard. \nThe plaintiffs also claimed they were denied overtime and tips. \nWhile a Sin City lawyer disputed the charges at the time, the Manhattan Federal Court case was settled in 2011 for approximately $150,000, according to court records and a source familiar with the case. \nWells left the club after the suit was filed \u2014 but the club posted a picture of him Monday on Instagram, writing, \u201cHe\u2019s back. Kevin has returned!\u201d \nDrakopoulos\u2019 lawyer Harvey Slovis denied that Wells had been rehired, and said the number of lawsuits against the club was small. \n\u201cYour lawsuit stuff is a joke,\u201d Slovis said in an email to The News. \u201cYou are talking about 15 years of activity and the only lawsuit I know about is one of workers compensation. This place is the least violent of clubs in this city and I have represented many. You are passing over the elephant to squash an ant.\u201d THE \u2018BOSSMAN\u2019 \nKonstantine (Gus) Drakopoulos, 40, the man who presides over Sin City, grew up in Astoria and built his little South Bronx empire with two associates: Lampros Moumouris, a Texas strip club owner, and Kyriacos Mavros, a Florida real estate entrepreneur. Former workers confirmed their roles. Their names were on incorporation records. Constantine \u201cGus\u201d Drakopoulos. \nDrakopoulos, who refers to himself as a \u201cnightlife impresario, entrepreneur and aviation pilot,\u201d has done well. Last year he bought a 5,000-square-foot five-bedroom mansion for $850,000 in Peconic on Long Island\u2019s North Fork. The house had been advertised as a \u201cgentleman\u2019s estate home.\u201d \nBoisterous and emotional, Drakopoulos holds court at the club with rappers and other entertainers \u2014 and he allegedly profits despite the fact that he\u2019s not on the liquor license, which would likely be a violation of state law. \nAs of Thursday, Drakopoulos was listed on the state incorporation papers of the club\u2019s parent company, SCE Group. \nBut his mother\u2019s name \u2014 Stavroula Drakopoulos \u2014 is on the liquor license, along with those of Moumouris and Mavros. Gus Drakopoulos' five-bedroom mansion in Peconic, New York. (David Wexler for New York Daily News) \nThat may be because, around the time Sin City opened in 2002, Drakopoulos pleaded guilty to securities fraud in Brooklyn Federal Court for illegally trading stock on inside information about a merger involving a frozen turkey processing company. Moumouris was a co-defendant. \nAlthough such a conviction would bar Drakopoulos from owning Sin City, he has left no doubt on social media as to who runs the show: \nHe used the Instagram handle \u201cGusBossMan,\u201d and has loaded his account with photos of himself with celebrities and dancers. A screenshot of Gus Drakopoulos' Instagram profile as it existed Dec. 2016. \nOn Nov. 8, Sin City posted on Instagram about a party for Gus at the club, referring to him as the top guy. \n\u201cDefinitely our biggest party of the year. @gusbossman 40th birthday party. VIP and celebrities coming to celebrate with the boss man himself. Gus!\u201d \nAlthough Drakopoulos often pals around with black celebrities at Sin City, a lawsuit indicates and former employees say he has repeatedly made racist remarks. \nIn 2014, dancers Kieara Gaskin, Tenia Stuckey and Denise Miller sued Sin City, alleging that Drakopoulos used the n-word and said things like, \u201cWe don\u2019t want the ghetto element you attract.\u201d \nThey claimed Drakopoulos and manager Kevin Wells called African-Americans \u201cb s, hos and sluts,\u201d according to the suit. \nThe dancers also alleged that women with darker skin were generally not hired, and if they were hired, they would be relegated to less lucrative day shifts, when Drakopoulos was not there. The roster of female employees at Sin City in the Bronx is shown in this undated photo. (BEVAN PORTER / ORIGINALGOGETTERS) \nAdditionally, they claimed they were forced to pay arbitrary fines. Gaskin, for example, asserted that she had to pay $500 to Wells to return to work after leaving for a period. \nFinally, they claimed that managers slapped, grabbed or poked their privates. A lawyer for the club denied the allegations at the time. The Manhattan Federal Court case settled in June for an undisclosed amount. Neither Gaskin nor Stuckey, would comment for this article. \nIn a 2013 text message obtained by The News, Drakopoulos sent a fake Christmas card showing a black man in prison garb behind security glass with a black woman talking to him over a prison phone. \nThe caption read: \u201cMerry Christmas from the Johnsons!\u201d \nIn a 2014 text, Drakopoulos sent a picture of two black men dressed in black clothes and backwards baseball caps to a manager and wrote, \u201cU need to speak front door about being (sic) more selective at door.\u201d \nSaid a former dancer: \u201cGus would come to the back and say things like \u2018I got these n s coming and fighting in my club,\u2019 but whenever a black celebrity would come to the club it was all good.\u201d \nSlovis, Drakopoulos\u2019 lawyer, sent The News a current picture of the club\u2019s dancers which shows a significant number of African-American women. \n\u201cAs you can see, the roster has a lot of black girls,\u201d Slovis said in a text message. \u201cYou telling me Gus is a racist is pretty funny. 75% of the girls (are) black and Hispanic.\u201d \nDrakopoulos also engaged in a tryst with a dancer, according to a video viewed by The News. \nRecorded on a club security camera on Nov. 24, 2012, the video shows an undressed woman performing two sexual acts on Drakopoulos as he sits on a couch in his office. \nThe woman\u2019s identity is being withheld by The News. \nAsked about the video, Drakopoulos first asked in a brief interview, \u201cWhy is this relevant?\u201d and then added, \u201cI\u2019m a family man.\u201d \nLater, he issued this denial: \u201cI do not engage in any sexual activity with any of my employees.\u201d \u2018TERROR ZONE\u2019 \nSin City has been a major frustration for members of Bronx Community Board 1. \nDistrict manager Cedric Loftin said the club has generated dozens of complaints about violence and illegal activities and that the board has sent a half-dozen letters asking the State Liquor Authority to shut the club. \n\"We get complaints about violent activities that spill out into the local commercial community, and also illicit behavior,\" Loftin said. \"We feel that their license needs to be violated and they need to be shut down but our complaints have fallen on deaf ears.\" \nBronx Borough President Ruben Diaz has also called for closure . \u201cSin City has not been a good neighbor to The Bronx.\u201d \n\"Sin City has not been a good neighbor to The Bronx, and my position has not changed: this establishment is a nuisance, and it should have its liquor license revoked,\" Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. said. \nIn a 2013 letter, the community board cited 61 reports of dangerous activity stemming from the club, called Sin City a \u201cterror zone\u201d and noted that its liquor license had lapsed. \nRegardless, the SLA renewed Sin City\u2019s license. \nThe board last sent a letter to the authority in December, citing violence, emergency responses by the FDNY and \u201cactive\u201d drug trafficking \u201csince its inception and over its last liquor license renewal two years ago.\u201d \nAgain, regardless, the SLA renewed Sin City\u2019s license \u2014 without notifying the board. \nWhile Loftin and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. have called for the club to be shutdown, the other pols who represent the neighborhood have been silent. \nCity Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, State Sen. Jose Serrano and state Assemblywoman Maria Del Carmen Arroyo did not respond to requests for comment. UNDERCOVER 141 \nIn 2014, NYPD detectives opened an investigation into allegations of drug dealing in the club. Cocaine sold to an undercover officer inside the Sin City Cabaret, which led to the indictment and arrest of nine individuals in connection with the club. (NYPD) \nOver the next 17 months, four undercovers made repeated cocaine buys from dancers and bouncers, court records show. \nIn a recent SLA hearing, one of those detectives, identified as Undercover 141, took the stand hidden behind a screen and told of her nights buying drugs among the red velvet booths. \nShe testified that she had only to walk across the burgundy carpet to a stripper or a bouncer and ask if they had any cocaine, a transcript of her testimony shows. \nAs dancers moved their bodies and music boomed, she secured powdered cocaine wrapped in a dollar bill or secreted in a match box emblazoned with the Sin City logo. \n\u201cOther people can still see you, security guards there can see you, other people going by,\u201d she said, adding of a stripper: \u201cI asked her if she could get some for me in the future. She said \u2018yes\u2019 and I only had to let her know ahead of time.\u201d \nThe detective also testified to the existence of the illegal smoking room, and a bathroom attendant who sold loose cigarettes. \nSLA associate counsel Margarita Marsico called the club\u2019s smoking room a \u201cwalking health code violation.\u201d \nIn June, the NYPD arrested nine strippers and bouncers for allegedly dealing cocaine .

Padilla and Estevez, identified as a Sin City dancers, were two of nine people indicted in connection with the sale of drugs at Sin City. (Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News) HE\u2019S \u2018TROUBLE\u2019 \nAmong those busted was Charles Percell, a convicted felon also known as \u201cTrouble.\u201d \nIn the drug case, Percell, 47, was identified as a Sin City bouncer, but former employees described him as both a bodyguard and as an intermediary between the club and gang members. \u201cYou get a wolf to deal with the wolves.\u201d \n\u201cHe was a buffer between the club and gangs,\u201d a former employee said. \u201cThe projects are only a few blocks from the club and that's where he grew up. He had a way to talk with them. You get a wolf to deal with the wolves.\u201d \nIn addition to prior robbery and drug arrests, Percell was convicted of manslaughter in 1991 and was sentenced to six to 18 years, records show. He was released in 2001. \nIn February 2012, while working at the club, he was convicted of aggravated drunk driving \u2014 and still wasn\u2019t done with breaking the law. \nIn November 2015, cops busted Percell for carrying a loaded .40-caliber Glock. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was then rearrested for selling cocaine in Sin City, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison. \nIn addition to netting Percell, the undercover investigation has secured three guilty pleas from a bouncer, a dancer and a woman who was dating a dancer. Five other cases are pending. \nIn an impassioned defense of the club posted in August on the Observer's website, Sin City manager Frank Aleman slammed the NYPD probe, writing: \n\u201cFour cops had to come into Sin City including on holidays, watch topless dancers all to allegedly buy a few grams of cocaine, and as a result of something management knew nothing about, there will be scores of people on the unemployment line.\u201d \nAleman went on to claim the club has the \u201cstrongest security in the business.\u201d He ended his letter with the slogan: \u201cNo justice, no jobs, no boobs, no fair.\u201d CLOSING TIME \nFollowing the June arrests, the State Liquor Authority filed 18 safety code violations against the club in an effort to shut it down \u2014 charges strongly denied by the club\u2019s lawyer. The agency also filed charges based on assaults and noise complaints, a spokesman said. \nPart of the SLA investigation has been looking at whether management knew about the drug dealing. \nAt the same time, the NYPD filed a lawsuit aimed at shutting the club under nuisance abatement laws that empower the city the power to close places used for illegal activities. \nEight months later, little has changed. The SLA has held a series of hearings, but the club hasn\u2019t been shuttered once. \nOn a recent Friday, about 40 patrons sat at tables drinking and ogling the women. \nAt one point, the DJ yelled, \u201cThere we go ... Show me some t s baby!\u201d A dancer named \u201cDior\u201d encouraged a patron to touch her butt and he put dollars into her G-string and slapped her rear. \nAlthough SLA officials insist they are taking the case seriously, the agency knew three years ago that Drakopoulos appeared to run the club and to profit without his name on the liquor license. \nThe SLA finally charged him with a violation known as \u201cavailing\u201d in late December. \nThe SLA subpoenaed the bank account statements and wire transfers to see whether Drakopoulos had an undisclosed interest in the club. \n\u201cThe SLA charged Sin City with availing their license to Konstantine Drakopoulos after finding evidence that the licensee is allowing Mr. Drakopoulos, a person not licensed by the SLA, to operate and profit from the business,\u201d SLA spokesman William Crowley said. \nAround the time the SLA acted, Drakopoulos pulled down his \u201cGus Bossman\u201d Instagram page, and Sin City posted that Moumouris was the new \u201cbossman.\u201d \nSin City lawyer Martin Mehler has argued that the club had no idea about drug dealing, and that the strippers and bouncers were not employees, but contract workers who float from club to club. He also argued that the club had more than adequate security. \n\u201cI can show you beyond a shadow of a doubt that it (the drug dealing) wasn\u2019t permitted by this licensee,\u201d he told the SLA board in a hearing. \u201cBecause these people tried more times than not to get these drugs and couldn't get them inside my place.\u201d \nIn an interview, Mehler said he believes the charges are meritless, stating that Drakopoulos is only a Sin City employee. \n\u201cHe\u2019s not a principal of the premises,\u201d Mehler said. \u201cNo one ever said he wasn\u2019t managing it.\u201d \nSlovis said, \u201cIt is absolutely untrue that Gus owns that club. He manages it and I know the owners.\u201d NYPD BLUES \nLast September, even as the NYPD and the State Liquor Authority investigated Sin City, cops posed for photographs with the strip club\u2019s employees at a charity softball game. \nDrakopoulos immediately posted photos of the employees, clad in skin-tight T-shirts, grinning and posing with the cops in NYPD shirts and hats at the event. Sin City employees are pictured with members of the NYPD after a softball game. (Obtained by News) \nThe relationship between cops and the strip club has been of many shades. \nDeputy Inspector Brian Hennessy, the 40th Precinct commander, has complained in public meetings that violence at the club draws cops from other duties. The NYPD would not make him available for an interview. \nFor years, though, Drakopoulos has employed retired NYPD Inspector James Alles, who commanded the 45th and 52nd precincts, as his security director . \nThe News previously reported allegations that Alles\u2019 job was in part to convince police commanders to downplay or not report incidents in and around the club. \nThe 2013 incident in which someone fired bullets into the club door was never conveyed to the SLA, The News reported. \n\u201cAlles advised the club how to handle the police,\u201d former manager Mike Diaz said in July. \u201cIf the cops needed an explanation on something, he would give them an explanation.\u201d \nThe News has since learned that the city Department of Investigation has opened a probe into those allegations. \nA DOI spokeswoman said, \u201cDOI is aware of the matter and declines further comment.\u201d \nMehler, the club\u2019s lawyer, said he wasn\u2019t aware of a DOI probe. \nIn the nuisance abatement lawsuit, NYPD lawyer Antony Anisman argued that the club needed to be closed because it was a \u201cserious public nuisance.\u201d \n\u201cFor well over a year, the premises has been a location where individuals gather to engage in criminal activity,\u201d Anisman wrote. \nIn its press release on the drug case, federal prosecutors wrote that the nuisance abatement case was triggered \u201cin response to persistent criminal activity inside and around the club, including acts of violence.\u201d \nBut then, the NYPD agreed in November to drop the case in exchange for a $100,000 fine \u2014 in $30,000 increments spread over three months \u2014 and the right to conduct unannounced inspections. \nThe NYPD could already conduct unannounced inspections of a business with a liquor license. The searches were included in the settlement to remind the club of that fact, a police official said in a statement, adding: \u201cThe settlement allows for the business to continue to operate and for law enforcement to ensure that criminal activity is not being conducted at the location.\u201d \nAs for that softball game, an NYPD spokesman said it was between the NYPD and Def Jam Records, not the strip club. \n\u201cThe NYPD did not play Sin City in softball,\u201d the spokesman said.

The autistic woman says she was raped by between five and 12 men a night (picture posed by models) (Photo: Getty) \nAfter struggling to make friends at school, she says she loved having someone who would talk to her, listen to her and let her borrow his things. \nTom would come over to her house and have a cup of tea with her mum before going upstairs and sitting on her bed, listening to her. \nHowever, one day, he came into her room and kissed her, Taylor says. \nBefore long, they were apparently regularly sitting together under a blanket in the living room, with Tom touching her intimately. \n\"I believed that we were 'in a relationship',\" Taylor writes in her book. \nShe adds: \"I was prepared to do whatever would make Tom happy, for his own sake and so that I didn't lose my only friend.\" \nEventually, she says she was raped by Tom in her mum's bed - abuse that left her feeling like she had done \"something wrong\". \nAt the time, she was only 11 and living in a ferry port town in the UK. \n\"I didn't know what he was doing when he turned me over and lay on top of me,\" she writes. \"I had read enough about sex by that time to have a vague idea of what was involved, and I was pretty sure he hadn't put his penis where it was supposed to go.\" \nShe goes on to describe how, each time he had abused her, Tom would suddenly stop and go into the bathroom. He would then leave, in silence. \n\"Looking back on it now, I realise that he probably felt guilty and ashamed of what he was doing,\" she explains in her book. \nSpeaking to Mirror Online, Taylor adds that she \"didn't like\" Tom when she first met him. \nHowever, she says that he began coming round, cooking for her and letting her borrow his possessions - which meant a lot to her. \n\"It was the little things,\" she says, adding that how she felt about Tom's behaviour linked back to \"not having much as a child\". \nReferring to the later incidents in her mum's bedroom, she describes how the married man \"wouldn't talk to me after doing certain things\". \n\"I thought I'd done something wrong,\" she says. \"On the media, I'd see a couple sleep together then always cuddle up and have a cup of tea.\" \nAs a youngster, Taylor lived in a \"doss-house\" with her mother, where she was surrounded by \"weed-smoking\" adults, drug addicts and alcoholics. \nShe says she never knew her dad, while her mum often told her she was \"retarded\". \nShe was eventually diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. \nShe describes how she became so confused and lonely that she would have \"done almost anything\" to feel her mum loved her, or that she had a friend. \n\"I had a very blinkered childhood,\" Taylor tells Mirror Online. \n\"I didn't really have many other children around me to compare it to.\" \nShe says she realised her childhood was different from others' after starting school. \n\"When I started going to school. I'd say how many people we had staying at my mum's house... It made me start realising,\" she says. \nShe adds that, as a young girl, she would turn things into a \"monetary measure\". \nShe would notice that other children had new shoes, or had just been on holiday, and would ask her mum why she didn't have the \"latest things\". \nDuring her childhood, Taylor found a man dead from an overdose at her home and helped her stepbrothers to shoplift, according to her book. \n\"I was just five,\" she tells Mirror Online. \"We'd go out altogether. This is before the days of CCTV. I would go up to the counter and talk to the shop assistant. \n\"I would say I was looking for a present for my mum. I had a script telling me what to do. I would then change my mind and go out the shop.\" \nShe says her stepbrothers would steal products such as razors, perfume and DVDs. \nSeven years on, aged 12, Taylor got to know Nadeer, an 18-year-old from Asia who worked in a local fast food shop and she often saw \"around\". \n\"He was always outside the shop and would strike up a conversation,\" she says. Taylor is now a 22-year-old university student, with a young child \nFor their first date, the pair went on a drive and Naseer told Taylor he wanted to have sex with her. However, she was on her period so she refused. \n\"Afterwards, he told his friends and everyone at the park that I wasn't a girl at all and for a while they all made fun of me,\" she says. \nNaseer, who had aggressive and drug-dealing friends, would deliberately humiliate Taylor, according to her book, published by Harper Element. \nHe and his friends would call her a 'retard' and offer her cans of beer filled with cigarette butts - as she discovered after drinking them. \nThey would also hide her shoes and open the door when she was on the toilet. \nTaylor says she was still seeing Naseer when she started dating a 17-year-old boy called Karim, who was studying at a UK college. \nShe says he stood up for her when other people teased her, so when they slept together, she decided to tell her mum she had had sex with someone. \nThen aged 12, she was four years below the age of consent. \nIn her book, she says her mum replied: \"Aaaah, my little girl's all grown-up at last.\" \n\"The reaction was very bizarre,\" admits Taylor, describing how her mother then took her to the GP to get the contraceptive pill. \n\"The doctor was quite worried to say the least,\" she tells Mirror Online. \"That was another hint that this wasn't normal. \n\"The doctor was asking, 'is it because of your daughter's periods?\" \nShe says, despite the doctor's concerns, she and her mum left the surgery with contraception. However, she didn't ever take the pills. \nIn her book, Taylor describes how she started going to Naseer's friend Saleem's flat, where they'd play Grand Theft Auto together. \nShe also attended parties with the 25-year-old, where on one occasion, a huge man tried to rape her in the bathroom. \nShe says Saleem would \"test\" her to see if she could keep a secret and, before long, she was being raped by both him and his friends. \n\"That's when the truth finally dawned on me,\" she writes in her book. \n\"I hadn't been invited to the parties because I was Saleem's girlfriend, or even part of the group: I was at his flat to work.\" \nStill aged 12, Taylor fell pregnant for the first time. She says after Saleem found out, he got her so drunk on vodka that she blacked out and started bleeding. \nIt was shortly after this that, after arriving at Saleem's flat, Naseer told her to come with him to a house to see \"some boys\". \nThe next day, she returned to the house to find a queue already forming on the stairs. \nFrom then on for around six months, every night was the same horrific ordeal. \nShe was given alcohol, before being sent to the bedroom. There, she would swig from a bottle of vodka every time one of her rapists left the room. \nShe would use wet wipes and tissues to clean herself up. In her book, she estimates she was forced to sleep with between five and twelve people a night. \nBecause many of the men had come to the country via refugee camps abroad, she says they didn't have much money to pay for the sex with her. \nTherefore, the \"currency\" was a bag of weed, a bottle of vodka or a \"favour\". \n\"I disassociated a lot from that whole time period,\" she tells Mirror Online. \n\"I don't have many memories of it. I was always drinking quite heavily. It was a role I had to fit into. I would see it as 'it's time to go to work'.\" \nBefore she turned 13, Taylor fell pregnant again, losing the baby when another man pushed her down the stairs when she refused to sleep with him. \nAt this time, as well as regularly drinking, she had \"opted out\" of going to school. \nShe had a laptop that she was supposed to be using for home schooling. \nEventually, Taylor says she grew up from being a \"naive little girl\" and became aggressive, with pimps no longer able to trust her to stay quiet. \nShe became less popular and, aged 14, a 21-year-old man she had befriended persuaded her to go back to school, she writes in her book. \nAged 16, she became engaged to a man called Baashir and at 17, she fell pregnant. \n\"For the first few months it didn't feel quite real,\" Taylor tells Mirror Online. \nShortly before her and Baashir's wedding, however, she started suffering from mental health issues, which would see her \"switch\" and become aggressive. \nShe eventually gave birth to their child. \nBut she suffered post-natal depression, while her husband was allegedly stealing money from her to buy drugs like cocaine. \nHe would also strangle her, leading their child to try to strangle another kid at nursery after witnessing the attack, Taylor reveals. \nShe says, after this, she started fighting back. \nDetermined to build a safe future for herself and her offspring, she saw a counsellor - who made her realise what she had suffered was abuse - and went to college. \nToday, she has moved away from her mum's house and is studying at university. \nShe lives with her child, although she says she remains fearful social services could take them away after a previous experience with a social worker. \nShe says the worker said something about removing the youngster from her care after she complained about domestic violence - which is no longer a part of her life. \nNow, she says she has a loving partner who has helped her to move on. Meanwhile, she loves and cares for her child every day. \nAfter splitting with Baashir, Taylor alerted the police to a violent attack he carried out on her and social services visited her home. \nHowever, she didn't take any further action, believing the police involvement would have already served as warning to her ex-partner. \nWhen asked whether she would consider going to the police about men who previously abused her, she told Mirror Online: \"I'm not totally opposed to it. \n\"I wouldn't do it for my own sake, it would stir up other memories.\" \nTaylor says, however, that she would likely contact officers and tell them about her past if she \"had reason to worry about anyone else\". \nDespite what she's been through, the young woman says she doesn't feel angry for how her mum acted towards her. \nShe says she just \"feels sorry\" for her. \n\"I stopped contacting her for a little while and then got back in touch,\" she says. \n\"She's really good with my child.\" \nTaylor, who is on a waiting list for therapy, wants her offspring to have a completely different childhood from the one she had. \nWhen asked whether she'll tell her child about her experiences, she replied: \"I was wondering that myself the other day. I'm not sure about that yet.\" \nShe also says that, although she used to think the abuse was \"OK because I went there willingly in a weird manner\", she now understands it was not. \nShe says she hopes that telling her shocking story will help other people to realise that \"what is done to you isn't what you are.\" \n\"A grown man shouldn't be interested in a 12-year-old,\" she says. \nAuthor Jane Smith, who helped to tell Taylor's story, tells Mirror Online that it was a \"very difficult one to write\" because it was so \"distressing\". \n\"Taylor was someone I instantly liked. I couldn\u2019t imagine what she went through. It was hard to hear it, \"she says. \n\"She's very clever. But because of her Aspegers, as a child, she couldn\u2019t understand what was going on around her. \n\"She\u2019s had to teach herself what people mean.\u201d \nJane says she believes there are, \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d, other people across the country who are in the same situation that Taylor was. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the story of a lot of people,\" she says. \n\u201cA lot of young people are abused in this way. They may not realise it themselves, they\u2019re just looking for affection,\" she says. \nShe adds: \"The abuse needs to be stopped at root. \n\"How can people do that to a little girl?\" I Know What You Are by Taylor Edison and Jane Smith is published by Harper Element (\u00a37.99).

                              "text": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: Why is COVID-19 so harmful to the lungs? Are smokers more at risk of the virus causing damage? As a smoker, should I be taking more precautions than the average person? ANSWER: COVID-19 can significantly affect the lungs. People whose lung health is affected by factors such as lung disease or smoking tend to be at higher risk for more severe symptoms from COVID-19. You can reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 by practicing infection prevention techniques and carefully following other guidelines for slowing the spread of the illness. COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness that is caused by a virus. It can trigger symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Symptoms range widely, from very mild to severe. For those whose symptoms are more severe, the illness often leads to pneumonia \u2014 an infection that inflames the air sacs in the lungs. Pneumonia may require hospitalization and use of a breathing machine, or ventilator. In some cases, breathing difficulty coupled with pneumonia makes COVID-19 life-threatening. Poor lung health appears to play a role in deaths related to COVID-19. Although smoking isn't the only factor that influences lung health, it does have a considerable effect. Researchers believe that smoking makes people more susceptible to the infection that causes COVID-19 and its complications because smoking damages the body's natural defenses against some bacteria and viruses. Data from China show the fatality rate from COVID-19 in that country overall stands at slightly above 2%. For people who had lung disease prior to the infection, that rate is much higher at 6%. Other underlying medical conditions make a difference, too. For people with cardiovascular disease who developed COVID-19 in China, the fatality rate was more than 10%. For those with diabetes, it was 7%, and in people who had high blood pressure, 6%. In addition, the older people were, the higher their risk of severe illness. So the fact that you're a smoker increases your risk of developing more severe symptoms if you contract COVID-19. But other factors also play a role in that risk, including your age and any underlying health concerns. Whether you smoke or not, there are concrete steps that you can take to protect yourself from the virus. Always cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue or the crook of your arm, and then wash your hands. Don't touch your face until you've washed your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. Wash your hands frequently. If you don't have soap and water, use a hand sanitizer that's at least 60% alcohol. Stay home if you're sick, and insist that others in your household do the same. Reduce face-to-face interaction with anyone who might be ill. Disinfect common surfaces regularly. It's also important to get your annual flu vaccine and check whether you have received pneumococcal vaccine. Because COVID-19 and influenza have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to differentiate between the two. When you get a flu vaccine, you greatly decrease your risk of being infected with the flu. If you develop COVID-19 symptoms, that makes it easier for your care team to determine the source of those symptoms. Finally, follow the guidelines in your area for social distancing \u2014 putting space between yourself and others to reduce the spread of illness \u2014 such as avoiding large gatherings and keeping contact with others in public spaces to a minimum. Preventing COVID-19 is crucial because no antiviral medications or vaccines are available for this illness at this time. Instead, treatment focuses on controlling symptoms. Any claims that a medication, herbal supplement or other substance can effectively treat or cure COVID-19 are bogus. As you consider ways to stay healthy, keep in mind that the COVID-19 pandemic is changing quickly. Stay informed and get your information from reliable sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and Mayo Clinic. \u2014 Dr. Gregory Poland, Vaccine Research Group, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota _______________________________________________ Check the CDC website for additional updates on COVID-19.

                              "text": "This year, thousands of people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. While it might not be the most common cancer out there, it is one of the most deadly, and cancer patients will need courage and a sound medical team to help them through it.  Thankfully, experts are still committed to furthering their research on this tough cancer.  Last year, a medical team from the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust decided to analyze the most common treatment for pancreatic cancer: surgery. Their goal was simple.  BEWARE OF DRINKING ALCOHOL  Lead researcher Keith Roberts and his team worked with several UK hospitals to speed up the time between the cancer\u2019s diagnosis and its necessary surgery. Because pancreatic cancer is so dangerous, the researchers hope to improve survival rates by acting quickly.  During the trial, the researchers focused on speeding up the process for 32 patients, whittling down the waiting period from two months to two weeks. In doing so, they bypassed a procedure for jaundiced patients that supposedly reduces the risk of post-surgery complications, according to BBC News.  Despite overlooking this precaution, doctors were able to successfully remove the tumors from 31 out of the 32 patients. While the researchers are encouraged by these results, they will have to wait several years to see if their quick action will have any long-term effects.  Recognizing Pancreatic Cancer  Pancreatic cancer happens when cells in your pancreas cause DNA mutations. While normal cells might die from natural body defenses or common treatment, these mutations can cause the cells to keep living and growing. Eventually, a tumor will form, often causing complications to the bowels and digestive system.  HARVEY HEALTH RISKS: OFFICIALS ON HIGH ALERT AMID MASSIVE FLOODING  According to the American Cancer Society, over 50,000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2017. Of these, a little over 40,000 will die from it.  Why aren\u2019t more people surviving this cancer? In many cases, patients are diagnosed at a late stage when the cancer has already spread. For this reason, it\u2019s especially important to identify any changes in your body early on and talk them over with your doctor.  Here are a few signs to watch for:  Unexplained weight loss  Loss of appetite  Depression  Persistent fatigue  Pain in the upper abdomen that radiates to the back  New case of diabetes  Blood clots  Jaundice (yellowing of the skin)  Unfortunately, obvious symptoms don\u2019t always occur in the beginning stages of the cancer. Overall, pancreatic cancer has a rare incidence rate, but you may have an increased risk with certain factors.  These risk factors include a family history of pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis, diabetes, smoking, obesity and old age. In any of these cases, you may want to consider screening as a precaution.  Getting Treatment  If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, you will need to talk through your options with your doctor. Based on the new research, you may improve your condition by opting for surgery as quickly as possible. However, treatment will vary based on your age, overall health, and the progression of the cancer.  Surgery  If you\u2019re opting for surgery, you should understand the road ahead. Depending on how big the cancer is, your doctor may only need to remove the tumor itself.  NEW BREAKTHROUGH IN UNDERSTANDING CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME  If the cancer has grown significantly or spread, you may need a bypass surgery or partial removal of the pancreas. While these procedures are invasive, surgery may give you the best chance of curing the cancer.  2. The Whipple Procedure  This procedure is actually another surgery used on eligible patients. In this treatment, the surgeon will actually remove the head of the pancreas and may also remove other affected areas nearby. Then, the surgeon will re-attach the remaining portions to allow for normal digestion.  3. Chemotherapy/Radiation  Again, the type of chemotherapy used will depend on the location and size of the cancer. Often, doctors will use this treatment to shrink the tumor before surgery. If the cancer has only spread to one or two surrounding organs, he may use radiation or a combination of the treatments.  While pancreatic cancer does prove difficult to cure, medical experts are actively researching new treatments. At best, you should talk with your doctor about speeding up the time between your diagnosis and your treatment. Then, stay dedicated to your treatment and health, taking care of yourself both mentally and physically along the way.  This article first appeared on AskDrManny.com.",
