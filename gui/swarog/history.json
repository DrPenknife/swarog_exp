                              "text": "With up to 90 cm of snow and temperatures as low as minus 10.3 Celsius in Scotland, Britain and Ireland issued their most severe red warnings which advise people to stay at home as travel is too dangerous. Dozens of people were trapped in their cars on the M80 motorway between Glasgow and Edinburgh, with several hundred having been standed on the road overnight. Flights and trains were canceled across both Britain and Ireland - with similar transport problems in continental Europe. More freezing snowy weather was forecast as Storm Emma approaches from Portugal and France, with warnings of treacherous weather across southern England and Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said people should remain indoors from 1600 GMT on Thursday until the storm, with winds forecast to reach 100 kph (60 mph), has passed. \u201cThe risk to life and limb presented by the severe weather conditions should not be underestimated by anyone,\u201d he said following a meeting of the National Emergency Coordination Group. \u201cIt is not safe to be outside in such conditions.\u201d  All flights will cease from Dublin airport by 1600 GMT and the two carriers that use the airport, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, said they do not plan to fly from the airport at all on Friday. Trains and planes were canceled across Britain and Ireland. Emergency services also struggled on what many consider to be the first day of the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s Spring. One doctor told Reuters that staff were snowed in at a hospital near Glasgow, and another doctor told the BBC of a surgeon colleague who walked almost three hours in the snow to the town of Paisley to perform a cancer operation. Wholesale gas prices soared to their highest in at least 10 years on Thursday and the British power network regular, the National Grid, warned of a deficit in the market and sought to buy gas from market players to unblock bottlenecks. The cold spell, dubbed the \u201cthe Beast from the East\u201d, has been caused by a jump in temperatures high over the Arctic which has weakened the jet stream that brings warm air in from the Atlantic to Ireland and Britain. Britain\u2019s two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, both said that flights would be canceled. Police in Lincolnshire, eastern England, said that all roads were impassable. Britain\u2019s Met Office warned that freezing rain was likely across southern England as Storm Emma pushes northwards from Portugal and France, adding that it looked set to be the coldest spell in Britain since 1991. In Scotland, there were widespread road closures and no trains running on the two main lines to and from England. Police were rescuing stranding motorists, and found a vulnerable man in what they described as \u201clife threatening weather conditions\u201d. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports were closed. Some places in southern Scotland were under such heavy of snow, it affected funeral services in Hawick, near the border with England. \u201cThe issue for digging the grave is getting into the burial ground, and we\u2019ve had about 3 feet (90 cm) of snow here,\u201d Ross Walsh of Robson\u2019s Funeral Directors told Reuters. Ireland was bracing for the biggest snow fall since 1982 with public transport halted and schools across the republic closed. The Irish stock market said it would close from midday on Thursday and remain closed all day Friday. In Switzerland, Geneva airport closed for several hours and dozens of flights were canceled. Snow also disrupted road and rail traffic. France had its share of snow too, even on the beaches of the Riviera coast in the southeast. The worst was in the south where hundreds of cars and trucks were stranded on the A9 motorway, a strip that links southern France and Spain. The airport in Montpelier was closed for a period overnight but partially reopened on Thursday. Upwards of 15,000 homes along the Mediterranean were without power on Thursday morning, power network company Enedis said. It also snowed across much of northern Italy overnight, bringing fresh disruption to a rail network already hard hit by heavy snow across the south at the start of the week. Schools in Florence were ordered to shut, while heavy goods vehicles were banned from the roads in the north. In the Netherlands, strong winds caused problems. At Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport, only two of the six landing strips could be used on Thursday morning. Authorities had to close sea barriers south of Rotterdam to protect shipping.",

The only one of its kind in service today, the program\u2019s progress is yet another example of the Kremlin's active push to expand its presence in the increasingly strategic Arctic region, but the concept could find use in various roles elsewhere, as well.

The Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk on the White Sea in northern Russia had first laid down the barge in 2007, before transferring it to the Baltic Shipyard the following year. The vessel will first test its reactors by the end of 2018 and it will enter formal service in Pevek in Russia\u2019s Far East region in 2019, according to a press release from the shipyard. The Russian government plans to buy at least seven of these power barges in total.  When it becomes operational, the nearly 500-foot long Lomonosov will have a displacement of around 21,500 tons. Inside the warehouse-like superstructure is more or less a typical nuclear power plant, with a reactor complex, control facilities, and the necessary equipment to generate electricity and safely transfer it ashore. There\u2019s a helipad on top to help ferry technicians to and from their jobs onboard.  Each Lomonosov-class vessel will have two KLT-40S pressurized water reactors, a derivative of the standard KLT-40 and improved KLT-40M, the latter of which powers Russia\u2019s Taymyr-class icebreakers. Each S variant can produce up to 35 megawatts of electricity or 150 megawatts of thermal energy.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. Tugs maneuver Akademik Lomonosov as it begins its voyage in Saint Petersburg.  According to the press release from the Baltic Shipyard marking the departure from Saint Petersburg, the thousands of miles long voyage to Murmansk will be relatively slow going. At the very best, the four tugs belonging to Russia\u2019s Federal Agency for Maritime and River Transport, or Rosmorrechflot, will be able to move the power plant at around four knots, or just over four and a half miles an hour.  But the lumbering Lomonosov is significant in a number of ways. Most importantly, it represents the first of a class of floating nuclear power plants, which is also known as the Project 20870, that engineers designed from the very beginning to be mass produced. The first nuclear power ship, the Army\u2019s MH-1A Sturgis, which provided power in the Panama Canal Zone between 1968 and 1975, was a conversion of an existing World War II-era Liberty ship.  As such, Russia has suggested that if this type proves successful that it could export it to other nations with significant populations situated along coastal areas. As of 2008, the Russian state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom claimed that China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Algeria, Namibia, Cape Verde, and Argentina had all expressed an interested in the Project 20870 vessel or similar designs.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. A cutaway showing the basic configuration of Akademik Lomonosov.  For the Russian government specifically, the ships will significantly allow it to significantly expand its activities in the Far North and Arctic regions, which can often be isolated from communities further south for months at a time. As a result, it can be difficult to support fossil-fuel powered power stations in these areas, as it requires the prepositioning of large quantities of coal, oil, or natural gas.  At the same time, shifting permafrost and other terrain features, as well the generally harsh climates, can often make it difficult to quickly and safely erect complex structures, such as nuclear power plants, to support even civilian communities near or above the Arctic Circle. A mobile, floating power station helps get around these issues.  In Pevek, Lomonosov will be able to quickly replace the Soviet-era Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant and the Chaunskaya coal-fired power plant. Of the other six planned Project 20870 floating power stations, five are already set to help Russia\u2019s state-run oil and gas company Gazprom expand its off-shore activities in and around the Arctic region. The last one could go to Dudinka on the Taymyr Peninsula or Vilyuchinsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, both also in the country\u2019s far north.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. Another view of the Akademik Lomonosov.  If the concept proves sound, though, it seems likely that the Kremlin could look to expand the number of floating nuclear power plants, either of Project 20870 type or separate designs, to support additional efforts in the Arctic region, including supporting new or rehabbed military facilities. Starting in 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to refurbish various abandoned sites in the area, as well as build entirely new air, ground, and naval bases. This decision was part of a generally more assertive Russian force policy that had already become apparent with the illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region earlier that year.  In April 2017, Russian officials unveiled one of the first of its all-new Arctic sites, called the Arctkicheski Trilistnik, which translates variously as Arctic Trefoil or Arctic Shamrock, which sits on Alexandra Land, an island in the Franz Josef archipelago, and is north of the Arctic Circle. It is unclear whether this base\u2019s own power plant, which helps it remain self-sufficient during the winter months when it is largely cut off from the mainland, is conventional or nuclear.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. A mobile radar system sits in front of the main building of then still under construction Arctkicheski Trilistnik in 2015.  On top of that, the Kremlin has reportedly already been expanding its military use of nuclear power, including developing smaller underwater nuclear power stations as part of expanding undersea sensors networks in the Arctic region. This makes sense if Russian officials are looking to better monitor foreign submarine movements and otherwise secure territorial claims in the area.  Floating nuclear power plants such as Lomonosov could similarly help provide the critical power for permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary stations in remote areas, on ice floes, or even on the water\u2019s surface over protracted periods of time. Typical portable generators using fossil fuels might be enough to sustain basic life support in these locations, but could require a significant and regular logistical pipeline and wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to run power-hungry sensor or weapon systems. With more robust bases with these types of assets, the Russians would be better positioned to actually limit foreign military activities, especially in a crisis, rather than just monitor them.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. A landing ship assigned to Russia's Northern Fleet deployed a tank on a snow-covered beach during a training exercise.  That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t potential limits to or concerns about the fleet of nuclear power barges. As noted, these floating platforms are not particularly easy to move and once in place, they may essentially take on the role of a fixed power plant. With tugs only able to move them at a top speed of four knots, it could take an immense amount of time and effort to bring them back to Murmansk or Saint Petersburg for any necessary heavy maintenance, as well.  The plan for the Lomonosov with its 70-megawatt output to fully replace the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant, with its top generating capacity of 48-megawatts, as well as the Chaunskaya generating plant might be optimistic, as well. It would no doubt require the ship to run regularly and without incident in order to provide that steady stream of power to the communities in and around Pevek.  And while Russian authorities insist that the KLT-40S reactor design is both proven and reliable, it is based on a decade's old design. In 2011, the icebreaker Taymyr suffered a coolant leak on one of its KLT-40Ms that resulted in a release of radiation into the atmosphere in spite of various redundancies and other safety features found on that already updated design.  Combining it with a floating platform in a region where weather can quickly turn extreme has long prompted concerns about the potential for a major radiological incident and environment disaster, as well. Russia claims that the Lomonosov is sufficiently hardened against a variety of natural disasters and accidents, reportedly being strong enough to even brush off a small plane crashing into it.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. A diagram showing the basic components of the KLT-40S reactor.  And regardless of whether the base KLT-40 design is safe in principle, there are questions about whether or not Russia\u2019s nuclear industry is capable of the necessary quality control and routine maintenance to keep it that way or will have adequate funding to do so. Just in the past 18 months, there have been reports of unexplained increases in radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere originating from Russia, with experts saying the most likely culprits are poorly maintained nuclear power plants and waste facilities.  Still, the Project 20870 program, along with Russia\u2019s other military and civil investments in the Arctic region, show that the country is serious about expanding its presence there. Doing so can only help the country gain improved access to various natural resources and trade routes, as well as deny the same, as well as freedom of military movement in a crisis, to its potential opponents.  The Kremlin isn\u2019t alone in identifying the growing importance of the region, either. China, among others, is now reportedly increasing its own activities and investments in the Arctic, presenting another challenge to the United States its regional partners, such as Canada, Japan, and South Korea. The Chinese government expects to commission its first domestically produced ice-capable research ship, the Xuelong 2 or Snow Dragon 2, in 2019.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. China's Xue Long icebreaker.  \u201cU.S. presence in the Arctic is necessary for more than just power projection; it\u2019s a matter of national security,\u201d U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Paul Zukunft, who\u2019s service controls the U.S. government\u2019s only two remaining icebreakers, told legislators during a hearing in May 2017. \u201cIf they remain unchecked, the Russians will extend their sphere of influence to over five million square miles of Arctic ice and water.\u201d  If the Project 20870 program proves workable to any serious degree, it might kickstart a renaissance of sorts for power ships and float nuclear power plants, which could have broad applications in coastal areas. As already noted, Rosatom has indicated that the Lomonosov could be an attractive design for any country that is looking to rapidly expand reliable power in coastal regions. Depending on how robust the power grid might be, it might even be possible to use the floating power station to provide electricity much further inland, as well.  This sort of capability could easily have a wide variety of applications in any remote littoral area, such as the Pacific Ocean, it might be otherwise difficult to rapidly establish the necessary prime power during sustained, but distributed military operations or in the aftermath of a natural disaster. For military forces especially, being able to deploy a high-capability, but relatively mobile power plant might just be increasingly necessary given the growing electricity demands of advanced sensor systems and other equipment, and even potentially certain future weapon systems such as land-based railguns.  \u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. Akademik Lomonosov under construction.  In addition, concepts such as the Lomonosov could serve as a stepping stone to the development of even smaller, more portable nuclear reactors to support military operations. These units would also be even better suited to rapid deployment as part of a humanitarian relief mission.  \"Maybe one of the most tragic events in recent history with the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico. 3.5 million Americans who are without electricity. We're trying to get micro generators down there. We're trying to get fuel down there,\" U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said during a panel discussion in September 2017. \"Wouldn't it make abundant good sense if we had small modular reactors that literally you could put in the back of a C-17 aircraft, transport to an area like Puerto Rico push it out the back end, crank it up, plug it in that could serve tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people very quickly?\"  As with the MH-1A floating nuclear power plant, this wouldn't be the first time the U.S. government has explored this concept. During the 1960s, the Army experimented with an air-transportable nuclear reactor called the ML-1, which was small enough that its two main parts could each fit on the back of a tractor-trailer truck or a rail car. The U.S. Air Force also employed small nuclear reactors during the Cold War to power remote radar stations and a similar, containerized design supported U.S. government research work for a time at McMurdo Station in Antarctica.  In the aftermath of Hurricane Iwa in 1982 in Hawaii, the U.S. Navy investigated whether it might be possible to power storm-damaged areas by linking a nuclear submarine to the local power grid. It's an idea that reappeared on internet forums and comments sections after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico.  Unfortunately, these ideas have so far not proven to be practical options. ML-1 was exceptionally expensive and proved unsuitable for use on a wide scale. It hasn't appeared to be any more cost-effective to use nuclear warships as temporary power stations.  Experts are also skeptical about whether miniature reactors such as ML-1 could be any cheaper to produce now and suggest that any practical mobile designs that a company could mass produce would still be closer in size to the one on Lomonosov or other ships. The safety and security requirements of deploying numerous small reactors could easily add to the overall costs and make the concept of dubious value in the end.  It remains to be seen how rapidly the Russians can build the remaining six planned Project 20870 power plants and how capable they actually are in practice, for operations in the Arctic or anywhere else. If nothing else, Lomonosov\u2019s trip to Murmansk makes it clear that the Russians are moving ahead to expanding that influence in the Arctic to the full extent that they can, especially as additional competitors, such as China, are making their own inroads in the region.

                              "text": "Louis Fernandez walks along a flooded Collins Avenue in Miami Beach in September 2015. Lynne Sladky/AP  On Monday morning, the Trump administration revealed its long-awaited infrastructure plan, which aims to funnel $1.5 trillion toward fixing the nation's roads, bridges, airports, and more over the next decade.  However, the 55-page plan ignores the key thing that would save the US billions in infrastructure every year: resilience in the face of climate change.  Stephanie Gidigbi, a policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the plan \"misguided.\"  \"The Trump administration's misguided infrastructure plan ignores the threats facing our country from stronger storms, higher temperatures, and bigger floods,\" she told Business Insider. \"Smart investments in our future would help make our communities more resilient to withstand the effects of climate change, and would recognize the opportunities in cleaner energy.\"  Though it's hard to say exactly how much climate change-linked infrastructure damages costs the US, a 2017 study estimates that rising temperatures are increasing maintenance and construction costs for roads by billions of dollars every year.  That's because asphalt is sensitive to temperature. If it gets too cold, it can crack; and if it gets too hot, it can partially melt. Temperature can determine the construction method, too. Asphalt blends that are more resilient to hot summers often cost more, but they are also less prone to damages.  In 2010, temperature changes added anywhere from $13.6 billion to $14.5 billion in annual pavement costs, according to the study. That figure could increase to $19 billion in 2040 and $21.8 billion in 2070. Under a more extreme prediction, warmer temperatures could contribute $26.3 billion and $35.8 billion in annual costs by 2040 and 2070 respectively.  These forecasts do not account for road impacts from flooding and storm surges, which would make cost figures even higher.  \"Because these transportation systems constitute large civil investments ($7.7 trillion in assets and $45 billion annual expenditures) and underpin an economic vibrancy [3.1 trillion miles] of public travel per year and private citizen expenditures equal to 8.9% of GDP), the impacts [of climate change] may be substantial,\" the researchers wrote.  Trump's plan is a departure from how infrastructure is usually funded. As BI's Bob Bryan notes, the federal government typically covers the majority of the cost, but under Trump's plan, local governments would take on 80% or more of the financial burden. Local governments are already largely responsible for repairs after major storms and other weather events. The City of New York, for example, plans to spend $20 billion on damages from Hurricane Sandy.  \"This proposal doesn't begin to respond to the scale of assistance local communities need to cope with these mounting impacts \u2014 it merely shifts the burden of rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure onto state and local budgets which are already strapped,\" Ken Kimmell, president of the science advocacy nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.  One section of the plan says the White House hopes to expedite the environmental review process for new infrastructure projects by requiring a firm deadline of 21 months. Under current law, projects require analyses that anticipate environmental impacts, some of which take years. Democrats have expressed uncertainty link? about cutting down this regulatory red tape. They say that shrinking the approval time for reviews could make it easier for project sponsors to dodge environmental regulations.  The plan builds on the Trump administration's promise to roll back legislation that addresses climate change, including the Clean Power Plan, Paris Agreement, and Clean Water Act. In 2017, the US government revoked a plan to require higher flood standards for highways and bridges as well.  Kimmel notes the infrastructure plan also doesn't mention renewable energy, the modern electric grid, resilience, or adaptation.  \"This is a plan to shore up the infrastructure of the past, rather than invest in what we need for the future,\" he said.",

                              "text": "PARIS \u2014 A blast of Siberian weather sent temperatures plunging across much of Europe on Tuesday, causing headaches for travelers and leading to several deaths from exposure as snow carpeted palm-lined Mediterranean beaches.    The icy weather is in stark contrast to conditions in the Arctic itself, which is experiencing an \u201coff-the-charts\u201d heat wave this week, according to the European Geosciences Institute.    Meteorologists have documented temperatures above freezing in some parts of the Arctic, causing astonishment among many scientists.    But to the south swathes of Europe were shivering under temperatures well below freezing, claiming at least 10 lives across the continent in a snap dubbed \u201cthe Beast from the East\u201d by British tabloids.    At least five deaths were reported in Poland alone on Monday as the mercury dropped to minus 16 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit) overnight in Warsaw.    That brought the number of Polish deaths from freezing to 53 since November 1, and temperatures are expected to remain below minus 12 Celsius across the country Tuesday, with the cold accentuated by a biting wind.    In Lithuania, temperatures dropped to as low as minus 26 degrees Celsius overnight, and one suspected death of a man from freezing was reported in the capital Vilnius.    In Britain, authorities warned of five to 10 centimeters (2-4 inches) of snow on Tuesday and the likelihood of travel delays on roads, rail networks and at airports, while electricity and even mobile phone service may be cut in some areas.    On Monday, British Airways cancelled more than 60 short-haul flights either departing or arriving from London Heathrow airport.    Some of the iciest conditions were reported in Italy, where many schools and daycare centers were closed, to the consternation of parents already preparing for closures next week linked to this weekend\u2019s general election.    Public anger was also growing over the disruptions to rail services across the country, as travellers learned that many track switches did not have defrosting equipment, meaning they had to be dug out by hand.    In Naples, the airport was closed early Tuesday and bus services in the city halted because of ice.    And a driver in Turin got a fright when a stalactite broke off from an overhead bridge and shattered his windshield \u2014 though he managed to keep control of his vehicle.    One of the coldest points overnight was at Glattalp in Switzerland, where the temperature fell to -38 Celsius \u2014 extreme even for the high-altitude area (1,850 meters), according to the ATS news agency.    In France, which has remained frigid but dry during the cold snap, forecasters warned of heavy snow across much of the country starting Wednesday -- though spring-like temperatures would soon follow.    On Tuesday, residents of Ajaccio on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica woke up to some 15 centimeters of snow on the beach, something not seen since 1986.    At least three people have died during the cold snap in France.    Across the continent, authorities have been opening emergency shelters and increasing relief efforts for the homeless.    The mayor of Etterbeek in Belgium said those sleeping rough would be forcibly detained if they refused to go to shelters, citing the \u201cmajor risk\u201d from exposure to the cold.    In Berlin, rising fears for homeless people led officials to open an additional 100 beds, with the city\u2019s shelters, now with a total of 1,200 beds, more than 90 percent full, RBB public radio reported. \u2014 AFP",

The Met Office is predicting snowfall for parts of the country despite the UK being well into spring. Here's the latest info on whether the snow is heading in your direction.  Northpix A snowplough on the ski road at Cairngorm mountain on Good Friday  What's the latest weather forecast?  A cold front is moving in from the Atlantic causing a wintry blast.  Snow is now predicted to hit Scotland and northern England this weekend.  By 9am on April 29, Scotland will have seen a sprinkling of the white stuff after it moves down from the north coast.  The Met Office wrote on its website: \"The heavy rain will be accompanied by strong to gale force northerly winds and it may be cold enough to produce some snow on high ground although this seems unlikely to settle.\"  By the next day, snow is predicted to hit the North Pennines and the Chilterns in northern England and southern Scotland.  And by Monday temperatures will drop far enough for snow to fall on high ground over the North and South Downs.  The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for Eastern and Southeastern England for heavy rain and flooding on April 29.  Meteorologists are forecasting downpours of up to 70mm in places accompanied by strong to gale force Northerly winds, while homes and businesses have been put on guard for risk of flooding.  Met Office spokesman John West told The Sun Online: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very wet and quite windy.  \u201cCaused by this low pressure springing out of northern France and is sucking in could air from places like Scandinavia. It\u2019s going to be a wintry mix.\u201d  Weather Outlook director and forecaster Brian Glaze said: \u201cMonday which is looking very cold and wet in large parts of the country and there could even be some wet snow.\u201d  He added: \u201cMonday will be unseasonably cold with temperatures in wet parts of the south and east possibly not getting above 5C.  \"Wet snow possible over high ground in England. Also a risk of gale force winds in the east, along the east coast of England gusts of up to 60mph.\u201dmet  The Met Office have warned flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and road closures.  What are the coldest UK winters on record?  Despite snow regularly blanketing the country, modern winters are nothing in comparison to those of the so-called \u201clittle ice-age\u201d which lasted from 1350 until 1850.  These arctic winters resulted in the River Thames freezing solid for months on end.  The worst UK winter on record is way back in 1683-84 and was dubbed the \"Great Frost\".  The Thames was covered in 11 inches of thick ice resulting in the famous Frost Fair \u2014 a festival held on the frozen river involving ice-skating, gambling and bear-baiting.  London News Pictures A canal in Little Venice in west London froze over amid sub-zero temperatures in early 2018  The winter of 1739-40 is one of the worst on record with a severe frost, which saw temperatures plummet to -9C, starting on Christmas Day and lasting until February 17th.  The only time the River Thames has frozen in modern times was in the so-called \u201cBig Freeze\u201d of 1963 which saw the country covered in a thick blanket of snow.  Sheffield was one of the worst hit with four feet of the white stuff.  Another modern \"snowmaggeddon\" occurred during December 1978 and the early months of 1979.  Against a backdrop of political instability in the UK, the winter was the worst since 1963.  more weather news OH SNOW NOT AGAIN Weather warnings as almost 3 INCHES of rain, gales and SNOW expected SNEEZY DOES IT What is a pollen bomb and does it make hay fever symptoms worse?

A bitterly cold wind smashed the country at the end of November 1978 bringing blizzards and snow showers.  The worst winter of the new century was in December 2010 which broke national records and covered Britain in ice and snow.  Once again dubbed the \u201cBig Freeze\u201d, the average temperature for the month, which was -1C, was the coldest for 100 years, the Met Office confirmed.",

                              "text": "Super Bowl Weather  The Minnesota Climatology Office has put together a page showing climatology facts for February 4th in the Twin Cities - the date of Super Bowl LII. Here's what they say about snow depth and amount of sunshine in early February:  \"In reality, the weather for the first week of February can vary greatly. At times, it can be the coldest part of the winter and \"sporting\" some of the deepest snow depths. The chances of seeing no snow cover occurs in about 1 in 10 years. Having a snow depth of about six inches happens about half the time and having at least a foot of snow on the ground is about 15% of the time. It is also the time of year that the length of day light becomes noticeably longer. By February 4, there is about one hour and fifteen minutes of extra daylight since December 21. On February 4, 2018 the sun will rise at 7:29 am and set at 5:25pm, Central Standard Time in the Twin Cities.\"  The Southeast Regional Climate Center also has a fact sheet on past weather for all Super Bowls. According to their data, the coldest high for a dome game was 16 back in 1982 (played at the Silverdome in Pontiac, MI). The coldest high for a non-dome game was 43 back in 1972 (played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, LA).  It looks like we will see the coldest Super Bowl on record Sunday here in the Twin Cities, as highs only climb into the single digits. Wind chills will remain below zero all day.  _______________________________________________  January Recap  The Twin Cities ended the month above average in the temperature, precipitation and snowfall departments. We ended the month one degree above average, with an average temperature of 16.6\u00b0. The 20.4\" of snow we saw means that January 2018 will go down tied for the 11th snowiest January on record in the Twin Cities.  _______________________________________________  _______________________________________________  Phil Prognosticates Today - 1-2\" Of Snow Saturday  By DJ Kayser, filling in for Douglas  Today is the day each year when we supposedly hand over the long-term forecast over to a lone groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil. Early this morning he\u2019ll crawl (okay, more like be taken) out of his hole in Pennsylvania to tell us whether there\u2019s six more weeks of winter or if spring will arrive early. Since Phil started predicting in 1887, he has seen his shadow a whopping 103 times - meaning he\u2019s predicted a continuation of winter 79% of the time (including the ten years that there are no records for).  I don't have to see my shadow to accurately predict that winter will continue across the state over the next week. Highs will be in the single digits and teens with sporadic snow chances. The best snow opportunity at the moment looks to arrive Saturday, bringing a fluffy 1-2\u201d across southern Minnesota.  Sunday could easily be the coldest Super Bowl on record - dome or no-dome - with highs in the upper single digits. Any chance we can move \"LII\" outdoors, so that Philadelphia and New England fans can get a real taste of winter in Minnesota?  _______________________________________________  Extended Twin Cities Forecast  FRIDAY: Scattered PM snowflakes.

Highs will remain in the single digits across northern Minnesota. We will be watching the chance of some light snow showers, mainly during the afternoon to overnight hours.  Even though highs will be warmer on Friday, they will still be 5 to 15 degrees below average for this time of year across most of the state.  Warmer weather (teens above zero for highs) will continue through Saturday before another blast of cooler air works in in time for Super Bowl Sunday. We'll moderate back into the teens for highs then as we head into next week.  While a few light snow showers will be possible across the state Friday, a better chance of snow works in Saturday across southern Minnesota, where a band of 1-2\" of fluffy snow will be possible.  We'll then continue to watch a few sporadic chances of light snow in the forecast as we head through next week here in the Twin Cities as clipper systems pass through or near the region.  _______________________________________________  National Weather Forecast  A few showers will be possible across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, with snow showers across the Northeast, Friday (especially in the morning hours) as the cold front that has been pushing east continues to move further offshore. Lake effect snow will be in progress across parts of the Great Lakes throughout the day before another burst of snow moves across the upper Midwest and Great Lakes by the evening and overnight hours. Rain and higher elevation snow will continue across the Northwest.  Cooler than average weather is expected Friday across most of the eastern U.S. behind a cold front that moved through the region. In some areas, highs will be up to 20 degrees below average. Warmer weather will continue out west, where parts of the Southwest will be up to 15 degrees above average.  The heaviest precipitation over the next five days (through Tuesday morning) will be across the Northwest, where 2-4\"+ of liquid precipitation is possible. Across the southern and eastern U.S., another frontal system will move through during the weekend and into early next week, bringing more rain (and northern snow) to the region.  Feet of snow will be possible at the higher elevations in the Northwest through Saturday evening as numerous systems continue to move through the region. Snow of a foot or more will also be possible due to lake effect snow in prone areas downwind of the Great Lakes.  _______________________________________________  Gulf Of Alaska Earthquake - January 23rd  The USGS has released more information on the January 23rd earthquake in the Gulf of Alaska: \"One week ago, on January 23rd at 12:31 a.m. local time, Alaskans were rocked by a magnitude 7.9 earthquake, with an epicenter in the Gulf of Alaska, about 350 miles southwest of Anchorage, and about 175 miles southeast of Kodiak Island. Four minutes later, Alaskans in coastal communities were awakened with blaring alarms when NOAA\u2019s National Tsunami Warning Center sent out a Tsunami Warning for the state and the west coast of Canada based on the quake\u2019s magnitude and its proximity to the coast. At the same time, a Tsunami Watch was issued for California, Oregon, and Washington. Ultimately, a small tsunami surge, less than one foot deep, was observed in Kodiak and smaller water-level increases occurred in other Alaskan coastal communities. A water-level rise of a few inches was detected four and a half hours later in Arena Cove, California. Three hours after the initial tsunami advisory was issued, NOAA canceled it.\"  Winter And Insects  How do insects survive in winter? The Midwest Regional Climate Center takes a look: \"Midwestern winters are too cold and long for most insects to survive without special adaptations or strategies. In cold northern latitudes, insects will either 1) migrate south to spend the winter months in warmer climates (e.g. monarch butterfly) or 2) overwinter locally. Overwintering insects enter a state of inactivity known as diapause; think hibernation for insects. In this state, an insect\u2019s metabolic rate drops, growth stops, and stored body fat is used to survive the winter. Insects can diapause as adults, larvae, pupae, or eggs depending on the species. Some insects are \u2018freeze tolerant\u2019 and can keep their bodies from freezing by producing alcohols that act as antifreeze. However, most insects in the Midwest choose to avoid freezing and may even seek shelter inside our homes.\" (Image: Asian multicolored lady beetles invade home during the winter.

More from Earther: \"Young Colombians are taking the government to court over the environment. The 25 plaintiffs, whose ages range from 7 to 26, filed a lawsuit in Bogota Monday demanding a right to a healthy environment free of deforestation and the irreversible impacts from climate change. The suit calls explicitly for the federal government to create an action plan to reduce the Amazon\u2019s rapid deforestation by 2020. (That\u2019s also what President Juan Manuel Santos promised during the 2015 Paris Climate Summit.)\" (Photo: AP)  New York Expanding Offshore Wind Energy  The governor of New York believes that wind energy will be a $6 billion industry by 2028, and wants to build new turbines offshore in the upcoming years. More from WSHU: \"With the release of its master plan for offshore wind energy, New York State is doubling down on its commitment to renewable energy at a time when the Trump administration is moving to allow coastal drilling for oil and gas. The plan calls for hundreds of turbines to be built on a one million acre site in the Atlantic Ocean at least 21 miles south of the Great South Bay, ensuring that none of the turbines would be visible from the shoreline. Estimates say that the windfarms would generate 2,400 megawatts of power by the year 2030 \u2013 enough to power more than a million homes.\" (Image: MATT YOUNG / AP)",

Snow brought travel chaos to Devon where this crash happened on the A30  What is the latest UK weather forecast?  After days of snow showers, Brits are braced for a day of sunny spells, with some areas set to see light patches of rain that will clear before the end of Tuesday.  It will be a icy commute, and a yellow ice warning remains in place across many parts of England and Wales.  Snow melt from Monday's sunny spells and overnight showers have increased the risk of ice on untreated surfaces.  Brisk winds will develop in the north, and will be pretty noticeable across eastern England, where showers will appear.  A car is left abandoned in a snow drift in Thwaite, North Yorkshire  Across the west, temperatures will be slightly colder, with lows of 2C in Exeter before midday, and highs of 4C around eastern regions including London and Hull.  On Sunday, wintry weather caused major disruptions as Brits were told to stay off the roads in southern parts of the country.  Dangerously cold temperatures of around -8C and around 12 inches of snow left locals in Devon forced to take shelter in a nearby school.    Have schools been closed due to snow in the UK?

In December, 2017, Britain's worst snowstorm in four years led to nearly 3,000 schools shutting out of concern for staff and children's welfare.  Storm Caroline left an Arctic air flow in its wake, with temperatures plunging across the UK and up to four inches of snow heavily obstructing roads.  Schools which shut included more than 500 in the east of England and more than 200 each in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire.  Birmingham was the worst hit city with around 400 schools closing.

                              "text": "President Trump arrives on Marine One yesterday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)  With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve.  THE BIG IDEA: President Trump sometimes seems impervious to the second and third order consequences of his decisions.  Several recent developments have highlighted the unintended \u2014 though often foreseeable \u2014 consequences the president\u2019s policies are having on his own supporters.  In many cases, he\u2019s following through on campaign promises \u2014 like cutting the flow of immigrants, renegotiating trade deals and rolling back regulations put in place by Barack Obama. But in the deeply interconnected global economy, the devil is always in the details and the implementation of some policies may do more to hurt than help the people who put their faith in him to fix their problems.  Here are four examples:  -- Small business owners who voted for Trump might be forced to shut down because the president is making it harder for them to hire guest workers. Here\u2019s a story that appeared over the weekend in the Herald Leader of Lexington, Ky.:  \u201cEddie Devine voted for [Trump] because he thought he would be good for American business. Now, he says, the Trump administration\u2019s restrictions on seasonal foreign labor may put him out of business. \u2018I feel like I\u2019ve been tricked by the devil,\u2019 said Devine, owner of \u2026 Devine Creations Landscaping. \u2018I feel so stupid.\u2019 Devine says it has been years since he could find enough dependable, drug-free American workers for his $12-an-hour jobs mowing and tending landscapes for cemeteries, shopping centers and apartment complexes across Central Kentucky. So for years he has hired 20 seasonal workers, mostly from Guatemala, through the U.S. Labor Department\u2019s H2-B \u2018guest worker\u2019 program. Importing these workers for a few months cost him an additional $18,000 in fees and expenses beyond their wages, which must be the same as he pays American workers. But that\u2019s the only way he could serve his customers.  \u201cRestrictions on guest-worker visas, which began during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term as immigration became a hot issue for conservatives, have gotten worse under Trump. And it\u2019s even more of a problem now that the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in years. Devine says he lost a $100,000 account because he didn\u2019t have enough men to do the job. \u2026  \u201cHe isn\u2019t alone. Cuts in H-2B visas are hurting small businesses across the country that can\u2019t find Americans willing to do hard, manual labor: Maryland crab processors, Texas shrimp fishermen, and Kentucky landscapers and construction companies. Devine said he believed Trump\u2019s America-first promises. But cutting off a good supply of seasonal foreign labor when Americans won\u2019t take those jobs is only hurting American business owners and the U.S. workers they employ, he said. These workers aren\u2019t immigrants, and there is no path to U.S. citizenship. When their seasonal work is done, they return home. That\u2019s why Devine thinks the Trump administration\u2019s stifling of guest-worker programs has more to do with racism than economics. \u2018I think there\u2019s a war on brown people,\u2019 he said.  \u201cBut what makes him most angry is that Trump\u2019s properties in Florida and New York have used 144 H-2B workers since 2016. \u2018I want to know why it\u2019s OK for him to get his workers, but supporters like me don\u2019t get theirs,\u2019 Devine said.\u201d  Association of Global Automakers President and CEO John Bozzella, left, and Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Hackett, right, arrive for a meeting with President Trump at the White House. (Susan Walsh/AP)  -- General Motors is cutting its second shift at the Lordstown Assembly plant outside of Youngtown, Ohio, next month. The move could cost 1,500 jobs at the 3,000-employee plant that builds the Chevrolet Cruze. This is in the heart of the Mahoning Valley, long a Democratic stronghold that broke toward Trump in 2016 because of his popularity with the kinds of blue-collar workers who are about to lose their jobs or reluctantly take buyouts.  GM says it\u2019s downsizing because there is \u201clower customer demand for compact cars.\u201d The plant already downsized last year, moving from three shifts to two, partly because consumers are buying more crossovers, SUVs and trucks at the expense of smaller vehicles.  Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who represents the plant, blames reduced demand, and the pending layoffs, on Trump\u2019s decision to scrap fuel efficiency standards \u2014 which the auto companies did not want. \u201cWhile low gas prices paved the way for the decline of compact cars \u2026 Trump\u2019s April announcement to weaken fuel economy standards put his thumb on the scale in favor of the larger cars and SUV\u2019s made elsewhere, hurting our community specifically,\u201d the congressman said in a statement last Friday. \u201cThe truth is, the fuel economy standards help sell more Chevy Cruzes.\u201d  President Trump speaks at an event in North Charleston, S.C., last year to celebrate the construction of the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)  -- Ironically, gas prices might go up because Trump pulled out of the Iranian nuclear agreement last week. (Iran is the world\u2019s fifth-biggest oil producer.)  -- The president\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran deal, and reimpose sanctions, will cost Boeing contracts worth as much as $20 billion to replenish Iran\u2019s aging fleet of commercial planes. The Chicago-based aerospace giant downplayed the impact last week, noting that there\u2019s already a backlog of orders for 737 aircraft so production won\u2019t slow. But $20 billion in planes represents quite a lot of manufacturing work.  Those jobs will now go to other countries \u2014 specifically Russia. \u201cRussian aircraft makers, who can skirt the U.S. sanctions, are already working on deals,\u201d the Puget Sound Business Journal reports. \u201cA Russian aircraft maker is exploring plans to make a modified version of its Sukhoi Superjet 100 regional airliner so Iranian airlines can buy the jet.\u201d  -- The trade war with China is increasing uncertainty for farmers and may still lead to punishing retaliatory tariffs.  China buys 60 percent of all U.S. soybean exports, and growers of the crop could be pressed hard if the administration cannot cut a deal with Beijing. Soybean-producing counties went for Trump by a margin of more than 12 percent in 2016.  Dave Walton, who voted for Trump and tends soybeans, corn and livestock in eastern Iowa, is not sure his farm could take the added stress. \u201cIf this turns into a longer-term thing, we\u2019re going to see friends and neighbors go out of business,\u201d he told Caitlin Dewey last month. \u201cIf this stretches into years, we ourselves won\u2019t be able to sustain it.\u201d  Walton\u2019s 800-acre farm, in his family for 118 years, has already been struggling to stay above water with falling crop prices, and tariffs could make profitability difficult. \u201cRight now, soybean growers in Iowa and across the nation are encouraging the administration to engage positively with China,\u201d he said. And if that doesn\u2019t happen, he added: \u201cIowa leads the nation in many things. The presidential election is one of them.\u201d  Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.  Sign up to receive the newsletter.  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:  Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) leaves the Civil Courts building Monday in St. Louis after prosecutors abruptly dropped a felony invasion-of-privacy charge alleging he took a revealing photo of a woman with whom he has acknowledged having an affair. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/AP)  -- \u201cSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner dropped her prosecution of Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) in the face of the defense team\u2019s plan to call her as a witness,\u201d the Kansas City Star reports. \u201cYet Republican legislative leaders said later that evening that Gardner's decision would have no impact whatsoever on whether the Missouri General Assembly moves forward with impeachment, a process set to begin at 6:30 p.m. Friday. GOP leaders also renewed their call for Greitens to resign immediately. Gardner\u2019s office asked the court to appoint a special prosecutor to refile the felony charge of invasion of privacy against the governor \u2026 Gardner's decision to drop the case came after more than 100 potential jurors had been interviewed for the trial that was set to begin this week. \u2026 Scott Rosenblum, a member of Greitens' team, said the judge's decision was based on the probability that Gardner had knowledge of perjury committed by a private investigator hired by her office.\u201d  Greitens declared victory outside the courthouse: \u201cThis experience has been humbling, and I have emerged from it a changed man.\u201d  But, but, but: House Speaker Todd Richardson (R) said his chamber\u2019s investigation of the onetime GOP rising star, who had presidential ambitions until the scandal broke, has uncovered \u201cadditional concerns relating to the governor\u2019s conduct.\u201d  Even if he survives impeachment, the governor has mounting legal problems: \u201cIn addition to the invasion-of-privacy charge, Greitens also was indicted on felony computer tampering last month over allegations he illegally obtained and used a donor list belonging to a veterans charity to raise money for his 2016 campaign,\u201d the Star reports. \u201cIn a related accusation, the attorney general's office thinks Greitens knowingly filed false campaign finance disclosure reports to the Missouri Ethics Commission, a Class A misdemeanor. A lawsuit in Cole County accuses the governor and his staff of using a self-destructing text message app to circumvent the state\u2019s open records law. And Washington University and the John Templeton Foundation are investigating whether Greitens violated an agreement by allegedly using an academic grant to pay his political staff as he was planning his campaign for governor.\u201d  GET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b  The Supreme Court struck down a federal law forbidding states from authorizing betting on college and professional sports. The decision is likely to trigger a scramble among states to legalize and tax sports betting \u2014 a billion-dollar business that some predict will change spectator sports. (Robert Barnes) SCOTUS also ruled a lawyer cannot disclose his client\u2019s guilt without the defendant\u2019s consent. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in the 6-to-3 decision that such a decision rests solely with the accused, even if admitting guilt would be a good legal strategy. The ruling will allow Robert L. McCoy, who was convicted of murdering three members of his estranged wife\u2019s family, to receive a new trial. (Robert Barnes) Melania Trump underwent a medical procedure at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to treat a benign kidney condition. An aide to the first lady said her surgery \u2014 which was vaguely described as an \u201cembolization procedure\u201d \u2014 was successful, and she is expected to remain hospitalized for the rest of the week.

(Jake May/Flint Journal-MLive.com/AP)  WATCH WHAT THEY DO, NOT WHAT THEY SAY:  -- The White House and Scott Pruitt's EPA intervened to block the publication of a federal health study on a nationwide water-contamination crisis, after a White House official warned that its release would trigger a \u201cpublic relations nightmare.\u201d Politico\u2019s Annie Snider reports on emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act: \u201cThe intervention early this year \u2014 not previously disclosed \u2014 came as HHS' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry was preparing to publish its assessment of a class of toxic chemicals that has contaminated water supplies near military bases, chemical plants and other sites from New York to Michigan to West Virginia. The study would show that the chemicals endanger human health at a far lower level than EPA has previously called safe ... \u2018The public, media, and Congressional reaction to these numbers is going to be huge,\u2019 [an unidentified White House] aide said in an email [to OMB's James Herz, who oversees environmental issues] ... The email added: \u2018The impact to EPA and [the Defense Department] is going to be extremely painful.\u2019 ... More than three months later, the draft study remains unpublished, and the HHS unit says it has no scheduled date to release it for public comment.\u201d  -- Meanwhile, the White House recently canceled a NASA program aimed at monitoring levels of carbon dioxide and methane. (Science)  Israeli troops fire tear-gas and live ammunition on Palestinian protesters near the border with Israel. (Hathiam Imad/European Pressphoto Agency/Shutterstock)  THE NEW WORLD ORDER:  -- Israeli forces killed 59 Palestinians and injured at least 2,700 others during yesterday's protests along the Gaza border as the new U.S. Embassy opened in Jerusalem. The violence marked the territory's bloodiest day since the Israel-Gaza conflict in 2014. Loveday Morris and Hazem Balousha report: \u201cTens of thousands of Palestinians had gathered on the edges of the fenced off blockaded territory from midmorning. Many came to peacefully demonstrate, bringing their children, carrying flags. Food stalls sold snacks and music blared. But the protests appeared to have a more violent edge \u2026 At [one gathering point], organizers urged protesters over loudspeakers to burst through the fence, telling them Israeli soldiers were fleeing their positions, even as they were reinforcing them. Israeli snipers were determined not to allow a breach, and ambulances soon began screaming back and forth from the fence, as gunshots rang out over the crowd. No Israeli soldiers were injured, though, and Israel drew widespread condemnation for an excessive use of force.\u201d  -- The Trump administration refused to admonish Israel and sought to blame Hamas solely for the violence. John Hudson reports: \u201c'The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas,' [deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah said]. 'Israel has the right to defend itself.' During the White House briefing, a reporter noted that Israeli snipers have killed people who were throwing rocks 50 meters from the wall. Shah responded by saying, \u2018Again, we believe that Hamas is responsible for this.\u2019 Later Monday at the State Department, [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo was asked about the violence. The top diplomat turned his back and walked away.\u201d But Monday's violence drew swift condemnation from the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, which described the killings as a \u201cbloodbath.\u201d  Ivanka Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speak during the opening ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. (Abir Sultan/European Pressphoto Agency/Shutterstock)  -- As tear gas and live ammunition rained down on Gaza protesters, a very different scene was unfolding in Jerusalem \u2014 where members of a high-level presidential delegation, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, gathered to celebrate the opening of embassy. Ruth Eglash reports: \u201cAmid the happy bustle of about 800 guests, as [Kushner] spoke, the controversial evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress blessed the occasion \u2026 there was little indication of what was unfolding [in Gaza]. In his video address Monday, Trump said that he was still hopeful for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, despite almost universal criticism of the embassy move from some of the United States\u2019s closest allies in Europe, from Arab nations and from the Palestinians.\u201d  -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced his country will recall its ambassadors to the United States and Israel in protest of the embassy relocation, saying the move proves the United States prefers \u201cto become part of the problem rather than the solution.\u201d \u201cWith this last step \u2026 the United States has lost its role as mediator in the Middle East peace process,\u201d Erdogan said. South Africa also plans to pull its envoys from Israel. (CNN)  -- This story should be getting a lot more attention: The surprisingly strong performance of a ticket backed by Moqtada al-Sadr in the Iraqi elections will rattle U.S. relations with the country. Tamer El-Ghobashy and Mustafa Salim report from Baghdad: \u201cSadr is a ferocious critic of American policies in the Middle East, and his unexpected electoral haul immediately calls into question the continuing presence of U.S. troops in Iraq. ... Sadr\u2019s ticket won the most seats in Iraq\u2019s parliamentary election, according to results from all 18 provinces released Monday, placing him in the best position to select the country\u2019s next prime minister and set the course for how the nation emerges from a costly war against the Islamic State. His ascendancy comes at the expense of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, the preferred candidate of the United States, who came in third.\u201d  How he's rebranded himself: \u201cThe Shiite cleric first gained international notice as a young militia leader who fought U.S. troops after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. But Sadr has grown increasingly pragmatic over the years and formed a cross-sectarian electoral alliance emphasizing Iraqi nationalism over loyalty to Iranian clerics and American military and political backing.\u201d He's presented himself as a technocrat.  How he won: Sadr's base was ginned up in an election that saw very low turnout. He campaigned as a change agent promising to fight corruption and reform the patronage system. This helped his ticket fare better than expected in some provinces.  A silver lining: The Iranians also distrust this guy. They see him as too independent, and he\u2019s pushed back when Tehran tried to dictate the agenda for Shiite politicians. And his spokesman sounded a conciliatory tone toward Washington yesterday: An aide said Sadr supports honoring commitments between Iraq and the United States concerning the training of Iraq\u2019s security forces and weapons purchases as long as they serve Iraq\u2019s interests and there \u201cis no interference on the sovereignty of Iraq.\u201d  Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and President Trump speak at the G-20 meeting in Hamburg. (John MacDougall/AFP/Getty)  -- America\u2019s three closest European allies \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 are still fuming over Trump\u2019s decision to exit the Iran deal, which has triggered a frenzy of meetings and phone calls between leaders as they weigh how \u2014 or if \u2014 to respond. Karen DeYoung reports: \u201cThe Europeans have not yet decided how far they are willing to go in antagonizing Trump. On Wednesday, government heads of all 28 E.U. countries will gather in Sofia, Bulgaria, where they will talk about the Iran agreement and their separate beef with the United States over looming steel and aluminum tariffs. But they are hesitant to deepen the wound, even as they want the United States to take responsibility for healing it. \u2018It\u2019s vital that we continue to engage with the USA and continue to interrogate our friends in Washington,\u2019 [Boris] Johnson said, to find out how the administration intends to achieve what Trump says he wants \u2014 a new deal with Iran[.] So far, the officials say, they have no idea how the administration plans to accomplish that. \u2018We haven\u2019t heard anything that is close to a strategy,\u2019 said one of several European officials.\u201d  -- Trump\u2019s tweet about Chinese telecoms giant ZTE threw trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials into chaos. Damian Paletta, David J. Lynch and Josh Dawsey report: \u201c[Chinese Vice Premier Liu He] and other Chinese officials have demanded that the Commerce Department ease restrictions on ZTE, but until Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet, the administration had resisted. \u2026 After Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet, White House officials spent much of the next 24 hours attempting to walk back his statement, saying ZTE\u2019s fate would ultimately be left up to a review by [Commerce Secretary Wilbur] Ross. And Monday afternoon, Ross insisted in a speech at the National Press Club that ZTE would not be a factor in the trade talks, saying, \u2018Our position has been that that\u2019s an enforcement action separate from trade.\u2019 Just three hours later, Trump tweeted again, contradicting Ross\u2019s statement that the issues would be kept apart.\u201d  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker shakes hands with Vice President Pence at the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  THE MIDTERMS:  -- Amid the chaos, infighting and converging investigations that have roiled Trump\u2019s White House, Mike Pence has quietly moved to expand his influence within the GOP \u2014 even when his own political agenda doesn\u2019t align with his boss. The New York Times\u2019s Alexander Burns, Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman report: \u201cEven as he laces his public remarks with praise for the president, Mr. Pence and [chief of staff Nick Ayers] are unsettling a group of Mr. Trump\u2019s fierce loyalists who fear they are forging a separate power base. \u2026 In addition to addressing dozens of party events in recent months, Mr. Pence has effectively made himself the frontman for America First Policies, an outside group set up to back Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. And Mr. Pence has worked insistently to shape Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsements, prodding him in the contests for governor of Florida and speaker of the House, among others. For now, Mr. Pence and his aides have found a yawning opening within the West Wing, as Mr. Trump\u2019s principal political aides spend much of their time managing his impulses \u2026 instead of overseeing the party[.]\u201d  -- During a meeting in which Trump told Brad Parscale that he would manage his 2020 reelection bid, the Times reports that Pence \u201cstood behind Mr. Parscale, rubbing his shoulders, as Mr. Trump spoke.\u201d (New York Magazine compiled a list of 17 times Pence praised Trump\u2019s shoulders on the campaign trail.)  -- But Trump has repeatedly sought to undercut Pence\u2019s influence \u2014 sometimes by attending the same events. Politico\u2019s Matthew Nussbaum reports: \u201cTrump wasn\u2019t planning to attend the recent National Rifle Association convention \u2014 that is, until he learned that [Pence] would be giving the keynote address. That led to a change of plans in the West Wing, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, and nearly a week after the NRA announced Pence would speak, the president was added to the schedule to speak moments after Pence. \u2026 And Trump is elbowing Pence out in other, smaller, ways: on Tuesday, the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List announced Trump would be headlining its annual Washington gala this year, after Pence gave the keynote address last year. \u2026 [And] on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s first campaign manager and frequent adviser Corey Lewandowski announced he\u2019ll be joining Pence\u2019s own political action committee, Great America.\u201d  -- In another illustration of how the politics of immigration have changed on the right, Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who is running for Jeff Flake\u2019s open Senate seat \u2014 has dropped her support for immigration legislation that offers \u201cdreamers\u201d a pathway to citizenship. McSally is instead backing a less-generous alternative that calls for a sharp reduction in legal immigration, sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). McSally\u2019s political shift is part of an effort to fend off a primary challenge from Joe Arpaio, the anti-immigrant county sheriff who Trump pardoned last year after he was held in contempt of court for ignoring a judge's order to stop racially profiling Hispanics. (Arizona Republic)  -- Today is the Pennsylvania primary. \u201cPennsylvania was [Trump\u2019s] proudest conquest in 2016, a state no Republican had won in a presidential election for nearly three decades and a victory he is still talking about,\u201d David Weigel reports. \u201cBut in both suburbs and rural areas this year, Democrats are mounting a comeback with implications not only for November\u2019s midterm elections, but the 2020 presidential race \u2014 just as soon as they settle Tuesday\u2019s messy primaries. The contests, the first based on a congressional map drawn by the state\u2019s Supreme Court, are a collection of rowdy ideological battles between Democrats running on universal Medicare, a $15 minimum wage, and whether to make college free or just cheaper. Democrats see the state as the launchpad for their party\u2019s comeback. Few states in this cycle offer so many additional pickup opportunities. For Democrats, that means competitive primaries all over the state.\u201d  -- Former congressman Tim Murphy (R-Penn.) has been working to sink the primary bid of Rick Saccone, who lost a separate congressional bid to Rep. Conor Lamb (D) in March. From Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade: \u201c[Saccone] is now running for the GOP nomination in a newly drawn, heavily Republican district that includes much of Murphy\u2019s old turf. The fight has gotten personal: Murphy has directed hundreds of thousands of dollars from his old campaign account to an outside group supporting Saccone\u2019s GOP primary opponent, state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler. Murphy also sent around a cropped video clip of Saccone that he believed would damage him. At one point, Murphy accidentally forwarded that link to Saccone while trying to send it to someone else. The inadvertent exchange about opioids triggered a nasty back-and-forth that ended with Murphy calling Saccone \u2018heartless,\u2019 while Saccone argued that his comments were taken out of context.\u201d  -- Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) accused Nancy Pelosi of \u201ctrivializing\u201d the issue of Trump\u2019s impeachment, which the House minority leader has described as a \u201cgift\u201d to Republicans for the midterms. \u201cPresident [Trump] can be impeached, and should be impeached, for his hateful, hurtful and bigoted policies,\u201d Green said ... \u201cTrivializing his bigotry also allows Trump supporters to hypothesize that while Trump may be an objectionable jerk, he is not an impeachable bigot, which is not true.\u201d (David Weigel)  -- Michael Scherer and Kevin Uhrmacher made a graphic on what influential Democrats have said about running for president in 2020.  Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Rick Perry huddle in the lobby of Trump Tower on Dec. 12, 2016. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)  THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:  -- Andrii Artemenko, a Ukrainian politician who communicated with Trump associates regarding a controversial peace plan between the Kremlin and Ukranian rebels, has been called to testify before Robert Mueller\u2019s grand jury. Politico\u2019s David Stern and Josh Meyer report: \u201c[Artemenko] said he assumed he would be asked about the peace plan, about which he communicated with Michael Cohen \u2026 in early 2017. [The Times] reported in February 2017 that Artemenko had contacted Felix Sater \u2026 to find out how he could make his plan for peace in Ukraine known to the Trump administration. Sater introduced Artemenko to Cohen, who left the plan in the office of [Michael Flynn]. \u2026 Artemenko\u2019s testimony could help Mueller\u2019s team fill in the gaps on the peace plan, which he has been investigating in part because of the roles of Cohen and Sater, who also worked together to try and launch a Trump-branded development in Moscow \u2026 The plan may also be of interest to Mueller because it reportedly was hatched shortly after Flynn discussed dropping sanctions against Russia in a call with the Russian ambassador \u2026\u201d  -- Michael Avenatti\u2019s take-no-prisoners media strategy could imperil his ability to represent Stormy Daniels. Emma Brown and Beth Reinhard report: \u201cScrutiny of his business record and of his motives has provided grist for distracting headlines in recent days. And his publication last week of Cohen\u2019s banking history \u2014 hard-to-get information touching on some of the most sensitive issues before the White House \u2014 could jeopardize his ability to represent Daniels in court, some experts say. \u2018Nothing he has been doing in the last four to six weeks with his multiple television appearances advances the interests of his client in the California action,\u2019 said Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor who specializes in ethics. \u2018He\u2019s catapulted himself to be the story. There are dangers when a lawyer becomes so publicly vocal.\u2019\u201d  -- Mueller\u2019s team argued a federal judge should reject Paul Manafort's request for a hearing over an alleged \u201ccampaign\u201d of negative leaks by government officials. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \u201cProsecutors said the sampling of press reports cited by (the former Trump campaign chairman) failed to include any sensitive matters before a grand jury specific to his case \u2014 disclosure of which would violate federal criminal rules to prevent biasing potential jurors \u2014 but instead simply revealed information about a law enforcement investigation. \u2026 [Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann] added that Manafort\u2019s \u2018speculative claim\u2019 fell far short of warranting a hearing or risking derailing the case.\u201d  -- Worth the read: \u201cThe Untold Story of Robert Mueller's Time in Combat,\u201d by Wired\u2019s Garrett M. Graff: \u201cBefore he became special counsel, Mueller freely and repeatedly told me that his habits of mind and character were most shaped by his time in Vietnam, a period that is also the least explored chapter of his biography. This first in-depth account of his year at war is based on multiple interviews with Mueller about his time in combat \u2014 conducted before he became special counsel \u2014 as well as hundreds of pages of once-classified Marine combat records, official accounts of Marine engagements, and the first-ever interviews with eight Marines who served alongside Mueller in 1968 and 1969. They provide the best new window we have into the mind of the man leading the Russia investigation.\u201d  Gina Haspel testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee for consideration to be CIA Director. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  PERSONNEL IS POLICY:  -- A classified memo on Gina Haspel\u2019s role in the post-9/11 enhanced interrogation program has left some senators disturbed. NBC News\u2019s Ken Dilanian reports: \u201cThe document, which has been made available to senators and cleared aides, [cites] cable traffic and internal CIA messages that were not discussed in her public confirmation hearing. The sources, some of whom support Haspel and some of whom do not, say the document describes comments by Haspel in support of the CIA's brutal interrogation program at the time it was ongoing. But they said there was nothing explosive that would change the dynamic of her confirmation chances, which appear to be strong.\u201d  -- The EPA\u2019s inspector general said Pruitt began receiving round-the-clock security from his first day as EPA chief, which came at the behest of former Washington state senator and Trump political appointee Don Benton. Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin report: \u201cIn a Feb. 12, 2017, email to several EPA security officials, Benton framed the decision as a precautionary measure given the controversy sure to ensue from some of the president\u2019s early policy decisions. \u2018I have requested 24-7 protection for the new administrator for the first week at least and then evaluate from there,\u2019 Benton wrote. EPA officials discussed the increased costs and strain on the agency\u2019s criminal-investigations division that would stem from such a move. The acting special agent in charge, Eric Weese, wrote colleagues that nonstop protection would entail doubling the number of agents on Pruitt\u2019s security detail to 16. \u2026 The inspector general\u2019s office, which investigates threats made against any EPA employee, 'played no role in this decision,' [Inspector General Arthur Elkins] added.\"  -- A $1 million contribution to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee appears to have come from a group of conservative legal activists who have been in the driver's seat in picking Trump's judicial nominees. Robert Maguire reports for McClatchy: \u201cThe $1 million inaugural gift came from a Northern Virginia company called BH Group, LLC. Unlike other generous corporate inaugural donors ... BH Group was a cipher, and likely was set up solely to prevent disclosure of the actual donor's name. \u2026 While the source of the money used to make the gift was masked from the public, a trail of clues puts the contribution at the doorstep of some of the same actors \u2014 most notably Leonard Leo, an executive vice president at the conservative Federalist Society \u2014 who have helped promote Trump\u2019s mission, and that of his White House counsel, Don McGahn, to fill judicial vacancies as quickly as he can with staunchly conservative, preferably young jurists.\u201d  NO APOLOGY:  -- The White House once again declined to apologize for press aide Kelly Sadler\u2019s nasty remark about Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). \u201cI understand the focus on this issue, but it's going to be dealt with, and has been dealt with, internally,\u201d deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah said. \u201cI was told Kelly Sadler called the McCain family late last week and did apologize. Beyond that, I don't have any further comment.\u201d (Callum Borchers)  -- McCain\u2019s Republican colleagues are publicly pushing for a White House apology. Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett and Eliana Johnson report: \u201c\u2018Just out of common decency they should apologize. And the person who said it should apologize. It\u2019s wrong,\u2019 said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) .... \u2018Everything happens for a reason. And sometimes the reason is you\u2019re stupid and made a bad decision,\u2019 said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). \u2018She ought to apologize publicly. If it were my administration, and it\u2019s not, I would also apologize on behalf of the administration.\u2019\u201d  -- Mitch McConnell visited McCain in Arizona over the weekend. \u201cJohn and Cindy and I had a chance to sit on their back porch and reminisce,\u201d the Senate majority leader said in a floor speech. \u201cHe still had plenty to say about work, I assure you. He misses his colleagues. He\u2019d rather be here. And I told him we miss him, too.

More than a third of Millennial Republicans agree that the \u2018Earth is warming mostly due to human activity,\u2019 as compared to 18 percent of Boomers and older generations.

The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for some parts of the country.\n\nMotorists were urged to avoid driving in several locations, with some forced to abandon their cars. Many schools were closed. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, which all serve the capital, warned of delays and flight cancellations.\n\nDespite the disruption, the arrival of snow two weeks before Christmas brought a festive atmosphere to Britain's parks and streets.\n\nSnowfall is relatively rare in southern England compared to northern Britain and mainland Europe, and Britons frequently gripe about the ill-preparedness of the country's infrastructure when cold weather hits.\n\nInflation and an energy crisis have added to the concerns this year, as household bills have soared and people worry about whether they can afford to heat their homes.\n\nNational Grid, which manages much of the UK's energy supply infrastructure, has instructed two coal-fueled power stations to start warming up, in case the cold weather threatens the country's power network, Britain's PA Media news agency reported.\n\nThe company said it was a \"contingency\" plan, which aimed to \"give the public confidence in Monday's energy supply,\" according to PA.\n\nCustomers of some energy suppliers are also being asked to reduce their consumption for two hours on Monday evening, in a pre-planned test being run by National Grid.\n\nSunday's snow dump came after several days of cold and icy weather which had already caused tragedy in Solihull, central England.\n\nWest Midlands Police said three boys, aged 8, 10 and 11, have died in hospital after falling into a lake on Sunday afternoon. A fourth boy, aged six, remains in critical condition.\n\n\"Searches of the lake are continuing as we seek to establish exactly what happened and if anyone else fell into the water,\" police said in a statement on Monday.",

                              "text": "Adapted from the latest Radio Derb, available exclusively on VDARE.com  If you followed the recent hysteria about our cruelty to illegal alien children on non-Main Stream Media, you'll be familiar with the depth of nonsense and dishonesty behind it all.  You'll know that the policy causing all the shrieking and fainting has been in place for years, long before Donald Trump showed up. You'll have seen the old clips from not-that-many years ago of Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and both of the Clintons telling us what a great evil illegal immigration is and how we need to take a strong stand against it.  You've probably also heard the numbers. You know that of the 12,000 minors detained in the six weeks of our zero-tolerance policy, only 2,000 were actually with a person claiming to be a parent. That's seventeen percent. You probably suspect, as I and Attorney General Sessions do, that if DNA testing were to be applied, that percentage would drop into low single figures.  You likely know that Mexico, through which these Central American invaders passed, has a well-equipped U.S. embassy and nine, count 'em nine, consulates scattered across that country from Yucatan in the south to Tijuana in the north. Any Central American seeking asylum in the U.S.A. could apply at any of those places, without any fear of being separated from his children.  You probably also know that Mexico is a nation addled with criminality and corruption. Much of what happens there is dictated by crime syndicates who depend on smuggling narcotics into the U.S.A. Those syndicates obviously have a keen interest in keeping our Border Patrol busy with other matters\u2014like, for example, detaining and processing illegal border-crossers.  As of last Friday, you're probably acquainted with the backstory behind Time magazine's current cover picture of a weeping tot who, according to Time, had been ripped from her mother's arms.  The true story\u2014uncovered by the British press, of course, not by our own worthless hacks\u2014is that the child comes from a comfortable middle-class family in Honduras; that the child's mother long fantasized about living in the U.S.A.; and that she at last acted on her fantasy, paying six thousand dollars to people traffickers and heading north without telling her husband, who is left in Honduras with their other three children, aged fourteen to six.[ Honduran father reveals daughter was never separated from her mother, By Daniel Bates and Karen Ruiz , Daily Mail, June 23, 2018]  The husband tells us that to the best of his knowledge child and mother have not been separated \u2026 though child and father obviously have, by several hundred miles, at the mother's initiative.  This whole thing, this whole hysteria, is in other words bogus from top to bottom, just like all the other Progressive hysterias of recent years: Charlottesville, Russian election meddling, Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, the savage racism of asking for voter I.D. at polling stations.  If you pay any attention at all, if you care at all about actual facts, if you're willing to privilege\u2014pardon the word, please: it's the correct word\u2014if you're willing to privilege objective truth over your own surging emotions and personal resentments, you know that it's all one Big Lie.  It's a usual thing for people suspected of a crime to be detained by law enforcement. If they have kids, this perforce separates them from their kids, since no humane society wants kids placed in adult detention facilities.  That's been true in the case of U.S. citizens for ever. To say it should not pertain to non-citizens is to privilege\u2014again, that's the mot juste here\u2014to privilege foreigners over our own people. And foreigners have a straightforward way to avoid this particular peril: They can stay in their own countries.  \"But they're desperate!\" wail the hysterics. \"Their countries are so messed up! And it's OUR FAULT they're messed up!\"  The first thing to be said about that is, that a very great many countries are messed up. Billions\u2014that's \"billions\" with a \"b\"\u2014of people live in messed-up countries. A handful of outliers excepted, all countries are messed up except the few established and majority-populated by Ice People\u2014Europeans and East Asians.  Getting and keeping a not-messed-up country seems to be a difficult, an extraordinarily difficult achievement. Not even Ice People can always pull it off. For a non-messed-up country, iciness is necessary but not sufficient. Russia is quite badly messed up; so is China. Check out Albania. Check out North Korea. Being an Ice People country doesn't guarantee you're not messed up, nor vice versa, but that's the way to bet.  As for the notion of it being our fault that Central American countries are messed up, I don't buy it. For one thing, messed-up-ness is the normal state of affairs for countries not populated and run by Ice People, as just stated.  Take Latin America. It's hard not to notice that the general level of messed-upness down there is greatest where Ice People are least numerous. The southern \"cone\" countries\u2014Chile, Argentina, Uruguay\u2014with mostly Ice People populations, have their problems, no doubt; but none of them is Guatemala or El Salvador. They are the least messed-up Latin American countries.  How is that? Did we evil Gringos just forget to go and mess them up? Please.  I'm put in mind of the reply the Mexican made to the Texan when Tex asked why Mexicans are always so mad at the U.S.A. and blame us for everything. The Mexican's reply, according to P.J. O'Rourke: \"You stole half our country. And not only that, Se\u00f1or, you stole the half with all the paved roads.\"  And then, if your country messed up my country, why would I spend my family's savings and risk life and limb to break into your country, the great messer-upper?  One of the blessings of living in Central America is that if you are dissatisfied with your country, there are lots of countries close by you can flee to for refuge. A citizen of Honduras is closer to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Panama, Colombia, and the Bahamas than he is to the U.S.A., and not much further from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil.  Refuge-wise, he's spoiled for choice. Why would he want to come here, to the Great Satan, with all our cruelty and racism and xenophobia and white supremacy and toxic masculinity?  Mrs. Hernandez, the mother in the Time magazine cover story, doesn't seem at all mad about Uncle Sam messing up her country.  Listings of the Four Cardinal Virtues generally put prudence at number one.  In the realm of the National Question\u2014the question of what kind of nation we wish to be, and of what kind of nation we wish our children and grandchildren to inherit\u2014prudence is surely appropriate.  If getting and maintaining a non-messed-up country is as difficult at it seems to be, and as dependent as it seems to be on a healthy supermajority of Ice People, prudence consists in a strict attention to demographic stability and the avoidance of wild demographic experiments.  With all my heart, and with as loud a voice as I can raise, for the sake of my children and their children, I urge prudence upon our nation's leaders.  But what our nation's leaders are actually doing is \u2026 nothing much.  There are plain political reasons for this. Some of them, some of those reasons, have been the motivations behind this week's hysteria over illegal aliens. Others are more longstanding and baked-in to our system.  Our national legislature is quite finely balanced between the two big parties. The Senate is Republican by 51 percent; the House is Republican by 54 percent (55 percent if you factor in currently vacant seats). Under these circumstances, with midterm elections just twenty weeks away, both parties are of course strategizing like crazy.  The Democrats' strategy is to run out the clock: doing nothing either positive or negative while striving to make President Trump look as bad as possible in the eyes of their base\u2014GoodWhite ethnomasochists and racial minorities. The Main Stream Media are totally on board with this, and pushing the strategy for all they're worth.  That's what this week's hysteria has been about. Random comment from a random media shill, this one actually Charles Blow [Email him] at the New York Times June 17th:  Trump is lying, as he often does. This barbaric policy is an outgrowth of his own personal cruelty \u2026 This practice of family separation must end, and Trump and every other politician who was silent about it or worse, endorsed it, must be held to account at the ballot box.[Trump and the Baby Snatchers]  That puts it as plainly as you could want. Trump is an evil person! Vote Democrat!  Godwin's Law\u2014which states, just to remind you, that as an internet discussion thread grows longer, the probability of someone mentioning Hitler approaches certainty\u2014has been much in evidence in this week's hysteria: so much so, in fact, that even some of the Open-Borders people have felt moved to protest.  Here for example was John Podhoretz, an old-school Jewish immigration sentimentalist and race denialist:  Hitler wanted all Jews dead. Trump wants non-Americans who are here in violation of US law out of the United States. Dislike that all you wish. I do. I do not think this is the right policy. But it's not the systematic elimination of the Other. Stop cheapening the Holocaust to score political points, June 22, 2018  Which might be a bit more persuasive if Podhoretz had not himself done a bit of Holocaust-cheapening five months ago when he compared either Presidential advisor Stephen Miller or our own Steve Sailer\u2014it's not clear which\u2014to Joseph Goebbels.  Still, it's a sign of how crazy things have gotten that even Podhoretz, a neocon's neocon, thinks the Godwinization of our public discourse has gone too far.  That's congressional Democrats and their MSM shills. What about congressional Republicans?  Well, there have been signs of sentient life in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Goodlatte Bill was voted down on Thursday, but it got 193 GOP votes, that's 82 percent of the House Republicans who voted\u2014much better than forecast. Praise and blessings from Radio Derb to all 193 of those House Republicans; a pox on the 41 Republican Nays (except those who, like Rep. Steve King, were voting against the Amnesty provision that the bill was trying to trade for patriotic reforms).  Speaker Paul Ryan himself did not vote. This is customary and not at all remarkable.  Ryan does, however, seem to have taken that better-than-expected 193 vote count to heart. He's been working up a bill of his own, a much cuckier, more donor-friendly bill. He'd planned to bring his bill to a vote this week right after Goodlatte's, but that vote has now been postponed to next week so that Ryan can jiggle the bill a bit to make it more acceptable to the 193. [House Rejects Hard-Line Immigration Bill and Delays Vote on Compromise, By Thomas Kaplan and Nicholas Fandos, The New York Times, June 21, 2018]  There is very little prospect that Ryan's jiggling will make this second bill anything other than what it currently seems to be: a huge mass Amnesty for alien scofflaws garnished with some vague, easily-reversed promises on border security and internal enforcement. That's what GOP donors want, and that's what Ryan will give them. After all, six months from now he'll be working for them openly, full-time, as a lobbyist.  The Senate is as usual immigration-shy and effectively inert. Even if Ryan's bill passes the House, it will die in the Senate. Everybody, including Paul Ryan, knows this.  So it's all kabuki theater. Democrats want to go into the midterms saying to their base that the President is Hitler; Republicans want to go in saying to their base that, heck, we know you want something done and we tried to do something, we really did, but there are just too many darn Democrats in Congress to get anything through.  The actual mood of the Republican base seems to be strongly pro-enforcement, even after this MSM blizzard of stories about howling toddlers being ripped from their mothers' arms. The strong vote for the Goodlatte Bill reflects this: GOP congresscritters have been hearing from their constituents.  My own thumbnail gauge of GOP voter sentiment is, as I mentioned last week, the Letters columns of the New York Post, which I have reason to believe actually reflect the feelings of readers of this conventionally center-right newspaper in a not-very-Republican region.  The Post actually ran an editorial about border detentions as the hysteria got under way, taking quite a stern line against President Trump's policy. [Stop breaking up families at the border, June 17, 2018] I waited patiently to see what the Letters column showed.  That editorial ran on Sunday, June 17. Monday, June 18, nothing. Tuesday, June 19, seven letters. Five of the seven were hysterical. The words \"ripping,\" \"ripping,\" \"kidnapping,\" and \"ripped\" showed up in four of the five. Godwin's law of course kicked in, quote from a Manhattan letter-writer: \"I now feel like I'm living in Nazi Germany,\" That's from the heart of New York City, current mayor Comrade Bill \"Honeymoon in Castro's Cuba\" de Blasio.  Even then, though\u2014on Tuesday, as the hysteria was cresting\u2014two of the Post's seven reader letters were non-hysterical. One blamed the illegals for putting their children at risk. Another calmly suggested using FEMA facilities\u2014Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2014to house the detainees.  Friday the Post ran another batch of readers' letters, nine this time. Only one followed the hysterical line. Incredibly, it refrained from invoking Godwin's Law; but it did include the phrase, quote, \"ripped from their mothers' arms,\" The other eight wanted better border control and scoffed at the hysteria. Seven of the eight supported current policy. The eighth opposed it from the right, deploring, \"President Trump's executive order flip-flop,\u201d which the writer blamed on Ivanka and Melania.  I don't say this is definitive, certainly not any kind of scientific survey. Those letters do show, though, that even here in New York\u2014the beating heart of Left-liberal lunacy and Republican cuckery\u2014there are plenty of people not taken in by the hysteria.  I agree, by the way, with that eighth New York Post reader that Trump's Executive Order was a blunder. The policy that caused all the hysteria\u2014separating kids from their parents or pretend-parents and keeping them in HHS facilities for a few days\u2014was perfectly legal, defensible, and humane. What's supposed to happen now? We put the kids in Border Patrol lock-ups? How is that better?  The logic is inescapable. An adult who crosses the border without authorization is liable to arrest and detention, quite rightly so. If there are children with him, those children need to be detained and cared for, too; though since it's the adult who broke the law, not the child, this is a child-care issue, not a law-enforcement issue.  If child-care detention in HHS facilities is unacceptable, and detention of children in Border Patrol lockups with their parents is unthinkable, the only possibility is to let the kids go. So thousands of children\u2014including a lot of teenagers and likely some adults posing as teenagers \u2014with no proper claim to U.S. residence, have gotten it. And when the accompanying adult really is the child's parent, they'll get to stay too.[\u2018Unaccompanied Migrant CHILDREN\u2019 Arrive at NY Airport -Appear to be GROWN MEN With SCRUFFY BEARDS and Shaving Kits (VIDEO), Gateway Pundit, June 23, 2018]  Our courts will make sure of that. Our courts are in fact a big part of the problem. Michelle Malkin many years ago stated the Prime Directive of immigration jurisprudence: \"It ain't over until the alien wins.\" That will probably be the governing factor in the fate of these Central American border-jumpers going forward.  A friend who knows much more about our laws and Constitution than I do tells me that Congress could in fact bar the federal judiciary from considering these cases.  That's nice, supposing my friend is right and I've understood him correctly; but the chance of Congress actually doing anything that imaginative, or that patriotic, is so small you'd need an electron microscope to see it. So this idea is like\u2014to leap to the other end of the cosmic scale\u2014is like the Heat Death of the Universe: kind of interesting, but not actually relevant to anything likely to happen in our lives.  The President could anyway have spared himself all the wrangling his administration's in for with the judiciary, and could also have spared us this last few day's screeching hysteria, by just doing what he was elected to do: build an effective border barrier.  It's not that hard. Israel's done it; Hungary's done it; Saudi Arabia and India have done it. China did it two thousand years ago.  What, you want to tell me we can't do it until Congress appropriates the funds? I don't believe it. I understand about checks and balances, but the President doesn't have that little power. If we can bomb wedding parties in Afghanistan without a Congressional declaration of war, surely we can put up a decent border barrier.  This has been Trump's greatest failure. Those of who voted for him, campaigned for him, and turned out on freezing winter mornings to show our support for him, need to keep telling him this.  Build the damn wall, Mr. President!

Anyway, I feel that, in taking up all the headlines in the leadup to the US midterm elections, these events all offer clues for discerning minds that a powerful elite group who have controlled us since long before any of us were born are showing increasingly greater signs of desperation. I welcome dissenting views to this opinion, as I certainly don\u2019t have comprehensive knowledge about what is going on, nor do I have privileged access to insider information. I am just seeing a consistent pattern in the events that are happening, especially in the tone and characterization that mainstream media is bringing to these events.  The Deep State has always played the long game with perception-building. Before the internet, the only widely-heard broadcast voices available were more subtly controlled by the Deep State, who could silence virtually anything and only had to make tweaks in the broadcasts from time to time to maintain their preferred perception. But right now, in having to fight against an awakening community with alternative broadcasting voices gaining increasing power, it seems like the Deep State is throwing everything they can at us all at once. And I simply can\u2019t find any other logical explanation as to the nature and increasing frequency of these events other than that we are seeing the desperate death-throes of a once-powerful beast.

Corsi Ph.D. Best Price: $14.95 Buy New $16.25 (as of 09:10 EST - Details)  The Caravan  In examining the caravan of people that is coming up from Ecuador that is intent on penetrating into the United States, a little context is helpful. Much has now become known about how the Deep State has used refugee crises and forced immigration to destabilize countries and create greater global power by weakening national sovereignty. The recent refugee and immigration crises in Europe have become a fairly clear sign of this once we look at it through this lens.  The joint strategy of destabilizing a nation like Syria, and then convincing people that they have to leave their homes and make long migration treks to other countries that most of them have never visited in their lives in order for their families to be safe, must be a huge and highly coordinated enterprise. There must be many insiders placed within these ventures to convince people to leave the only homes they have ever known, and take along young children to an unknown territory. There must be a combination of persuasion and force at play, where the fog of background war and related chaos provides excellent cover for the efficient handling of any dissent or opposition to these massive exoduses.  Back in the days of the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 uprisings, I was naive enough to believe that these mass demonstrations sprung organically from grassroots movements of awakening masses who had finally had enough. It was eye-opening to see in the aftermath of these protests that greater freedom and prosperity was not gained by the people, and in some cases the levels of government control and oppression became even worse. This is not to say that this movement was completely the work of actors; understand that indeed there was real anger and resolve borne from the suffering and degradation of these populations, and these emotions and the real victims who owned them provided much of the fuel for these massive protests. However, a subtle but powerful hidden hand was in control of the outcomes every step of the way, for a particular purpose that was anything but the liberation of an oppressed people.  The same is true of this caravan coming up from Ecuador. It is surely populated by many people whose passions and pain are real, who are honest refugees escaping either violence or hunger or both. However you start suspecting something else is driving them towards the U. S. border when Mexico offers them asylum, permanent status and job opportunities in Mexico\u2019s southern states and several thousand turn them down. Vice President Mike Pence spoke to the Ecuadorian president himself who said that the caravan was \u201corganized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela,\u201d so it begins to become clear that some within this caravan, beginning with the charismatic leaders and organizers, have ulterior motives for getting as many people as they can to the US border that has nothing to do with escaping violence and hunger.  Again, these are complex matters: use your discernment, put the pieces together, go with what resonates with you from a bigger-picture perspective. The video below, where you can see VP Pence speaking on the matter and tie-ins with Q-Anon, helps to make many additional connections:  \ufeff  According to mainstream media, these caravans have been going on for years and rarely get media attention. So why is it getting mainstream media attention now? They are saying that it is Donald Trump who is solely responsible for bringing attention to the caravan as a way to bolster support for the midterm elections. This comes from MSNBC\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe\u2019:  \u2018This caravan, that Donald Trump keeps talking about, that Fox news keeps talking about, the people on the Right keep talking about, as some last-ditch, desperate, sad, pathetic effort to, again, use non-white people to try to scare white people into voting for Republicans.\u2019  The Deep State: The Fa... Mike Lofgren Best Price: $5.63 Buy New $6.00 (as of 06:35 EST - Details) A CBC article entitled \u2018Trump strategists see migrant caravan as a political \u2018silver bullet\u2019 for U.S. midterms. They might be wrong.\u2019 never actually quotes any particular strategist who characterized the migrant caravan as a \u2018silver bullet.\u2019 What it does say is that \u2018Los Angeles-based Democratic consultant Jason Levin said it was not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d to energizing Trump\u2019s base.\u2019 This deceptive use of words has become a mainstream norm. CNN even offered a piece entitled \u2018The Caravan is Already Here,\u2019 an opinion piece that ties the caravan with the mail bomber in a double-barreled attack on Donald Trump.  If mainstream media is so insistent that this caravan is only considered newsworthy by Donald Trump in an attempt to rally his base, then why do they seem to be talking about it so much? And why did the New York Times send a full-time reporter into South America to walk within the caravan and interview some of the people there? Was it perhaps to bolster the narrative that this is a grassroots movement generated solely by innocent people desperately seeking a better life?  The biggest tell in all this is that if you scan mainstream media (right-leaning Fox News excluded), there is not a single word of concern about the hazards of open borders and the implications of hordes of people making thousand-plus mile trips to the US border expecting refugee sanctuary. Let\u2019s even put aside the notion that there are potentially hidden gang members, criminals, and traffickers blending into those groups. Let\u2019s just talk about the implications of a refugee crisis on the US border and its impact on the capacity to uphold current US immigration laws and discourage precedent-setting actions that will encourage more waves of immigrants flooding the borders.  Mainstream media has been absolutely silent on these matters, matters that any thinking human being would surely admit were real and need to be talked about in any conversation about caravans such as this one approaching the US border. This rather timely tweet by Donald Trump certainly underscores the mainstream hypocrisy in this:  I agree with President Obama 100%! pic.twitter.com/PI3aW1Zh5Q \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2018  Whether or not the caravan completes the thousand-mile journey from the southern border of Mexico, which it has now breached, to the US border, remains to be seen. But if a significant number of people do make it to the border, it is possible that we will be witnessing one of the last lines of offense launched by the Deep State before they are finally brought down.

                              "text": "That doesn\u2019t reflect reality, however. Oregon has seen over 100 million mail-in ballots since switching to vote-by-mail in 1998, and no one has ever found significant numbers of fraudulent votes. In 2016, out of over 2 million voters, only 10 Oregonians were convicted of vote fraud. (In fact, mail votes incorporate a number of security measures, including bar-code tracking of ballots and accurate voter registration databases. Most of the time, signatures are used to verify identity.) However, Trump has built part of his political success on lying about mass voter fraud, and the Republican Party has mounted efforts to make voting harder, not easier, such as purging voter rolls and adding further identity requirements. Vote-by-mail is a victim of that partisan attack, even if evidence shows it can increase turnout across the board. In the end, the stimulus bill passed in March did include $400 million to help states with their election problems. It\u2019s a big number, but less than a quarter of the amount voting experts say is needed to run this election safely during the pandemic. \u201cI think it shows a really lamentable lack of properly prioritizing the importance of elections that are the bedrock of our democracy,\u201d says Eddie Perez of the Open Source Election Technology Institute. Still, things could change. When Congress returns later in April, a more robust vote-by-mail bill championed by Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Amy Klobuchar is expected to become a priority. It would give even more cash\u2014the exact amount is still being decided\u2014to those who actually run elections, designating it to speed up the difficult transition to vote-by-mail. The bill, known as the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act, would also ensure that people who cannot vote by mail have more time to vote in person by requiring at least 20 days of early voting to prevent long lines and crowds. It would give states money to hire and train new poll workers to avoid endangering the older folks who usually fill that role. Wyden and Klobuchar may or may not secure the funding they want or the votes in Congress they require. But more money is definitely required to manage the shift properly. McReynolds\u2019s National Vote at Home Institute tallied up the cost in Michigan, including the price of facilities, infrastructure, ballot mailing, voter education, professional services, and employee salaries. Final bill: $37.5 million for that single state, and only if they start the work today. Ground game gone Even if the voting process is expanded, authorities act quickly, and they get all the funds they need, there\u2019s a whole other universe of issues to solve. For example, if so much of the country is under shelter-in-place orders, how will the campaign be fought? Already we\u2019re seeing election season shift as the crisis changes the way we interact and communicate. Rallies have moved from arenas to live streams. For the Democratic presidential primary debates, TV studio audiences were told to stay home. And fundraising has plummeted as markets have gone through some of the steepest drops and most dizzying ascents in US history. When millions of Americans file for unemployment simultaneously, no one is thinking much about donating to their favorite candidates. Jaime Lennon, a spokesperson for Dutch Ruppersberger, a congressman from Maryland, says business as usual is not an option. \u201cHe\u2019s so busy right now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are hitting near records in terms of phone calls and emails from constituents that need help, whether it be unemployment, or small-business owners needing help navigating the new aid package, or just folks with medical questions, like questions about the availability of testing \u2026 It seems like all election operations are on pause at the moment.\u201d \"We are hitting near records in terms of phone calls and emails from constituents that need help\u2026 It seems like all election operations are on pause at the moment.\" Jaime Lennon, Congressional aide Even if there were time to campaign, what would that look like when supporters can\u2019t go knocking on doors to drum up votes and the economic crisis is draining the bank accounts of grassroots donors? \u201cThere is no sunny spin if you are running against an incumbent. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d says Brianna Wu, a software engineer and candidate for Congress in Massachusetts. Unable to knock on doors, Wu may struggle even to get the signatures needed to end up on the ballot, a task her campaign was previously well ahead on. There are plenty of ways to target voters without ever having to meet anyone in person, like phone banking, television ads, and social media. But Wu, who ran and lost in 2018, says it\u2019s not enough. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly been fortunate in having a very strong digital game, but one of the lessons I learned in the 2018 race is you cannot win an election by just hanging out online,\u201d she says. \u201cI got about half the votes I needed to win by focusing on digital. And that was great for a first-time candidate, but my hardest lesson is you cannot win without a strong field operation. And I find myself asking, how the hell are we going to do that?\u201d Many candidates\u2014including Wu\u2014had been focused on building the kind of ground game that famously catapulted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to victory in New York City: knock on doors, talk with people, win votes. Now Wu\u2019s campaign is calling up individual houses and asking to send over petitions, pens, and envelopes to get signatures and move their fight forward. Meanwhile, conversations about fundraising are next to impossible. \u201cMy theory is this crisis will benefit the status quo,\u201d Wu says. \u201cIt will come down to name recognition if people vote at all.\u201d The fog of online war The social-media platforms that were exploited as conduits for disinformation in the 2016 election will have more impact than ever in the 2020 campaign: there simply is no better way to reach voters under lockdown. Though the platforms now have new rules and algorithms to limit disinformation, a rapid shift to making the campaigns even more digital creates new opportunities for misleading voters. China, where the pandemic began, first tried to cover up the disease: now it has armies of propagandists spreading conspiracy theories about covid-19\u2019s origins. European Union officials, meanwhile, say Russia is undertaking a \u201csignificant disinformation campaign\u201d against Western Europe, intent on sowing chaos and uncertainty during a crisis. The biggest disinformation threat the US faces, however, may be domestic. In 2016, Trump tried to undermine trust in election results by saying that if he didn\u2019t win, it would be because the system was rigged. And during the coronavirus crisis, while his rivals for the presidency have been muted, he has used his daily press briefings to repeatedly downplay the severity of the pandemic, rewrite the historical record about his response to the situation, and distort or lie about things like the effectiveness of drugs and the availability of ventilators. \u201cYou want a leader to give people hope, but you need a leader to be honest,\u201d says Angus King, a senator from Maine who cochaired the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, a project meant to define the US\u2019s national strategy online. \u201cWhat did Churchill say at the beginning of World War II? \u2018I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.\u2019 He told the British it was going to be hard, with no sugarcoating. President Trump said it\u2019ll be like a miracle and it will just go away, and that this malaria drug is a gift from God. Turns out it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s harmful.\u201d No stopping In the fall of 2018, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the western Pacific Ocean slammed into the Northern Mariana Islands, a commonwealth of the US. The storm had intensified over the span of three days into a category 5 super-typhoon, with winds reaching 175 miles (280 kilometers) per hour. Typhoon Yutu made landfall on October 24, killing dozens of people, destroying hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of buildings, and disrupting life in ways no one there had ever seen before. The Northern Mariana Islands pushed Election Day back a week in order to begin recovering from the storm first. Remarkably, this had never happened before in US history: elections have taken place on schedule through not just the influenza pandemic of 1918 but two world wars and even the Civil War. That means the likelihood of the national election being pushed back or even canceled is virtually nil. Election experts and constitutional lawyers widely agree that such a change would require a constitutional amendment, and little about the current political climate suggests that Congress could pass one. A bigger concern is that without the option to vote by mail, the pandemic will discourage people from voting altogether. The 1918 flu outbreak may have been responsible for low turnout in that year\u2019s midterm election (though turnout fell for the next two midterms as well). More recently, France held its nationwide municipal elections on March 15\u2014just one day after a national lockdown was announced in response to the coronavirus. Turnout was low, and the next round of elections was pushed back by three months as a result. Low turnout in November will inevitably invite claims that the results lack legitimacy. \u201cGenerally speaking, it\u2019s not a good idea to roll out major changes in election rules in the midst of a major election,\u201d says Richard Hasen, a political science professor at the University of California, Irvine, and author of a recent book on threats to American democracy. \u201cBut we\u2019re facing an unprecedented health emergency. And so we\u2019re not going to have a perfect election. The question is how we can make it as good as possible and disenfranchise as few people as possible.\u201d The answer\u2014for voters and for democratic institutions alike\u2014is clear: if America wants to hold an election that produces a \u201cnormal\u201d result without sacrificing people\u2019s health, it has a blueprint to work from. It needs to start now, even if the solution isn\u2019t perfect. And it\u2019s going to require one hell of a lot of paper.",

Ongoing investigations into Pruitt's travel spending and security arrangements were playing out behind closed doors as a trove of new documents circulated among the Republican and Democratic staffers on the Hill.  Staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees EPA, began receiving new paperwork from the agency this week, Anthony Adragna reports. That follows Pruitt's promise to Chairman Greg Walden that EPA would provide the panel with \u201call the documents and information EPA produces\u201d for a host of ongoing inquiries into his conduct. And Pruitt's now-former security guard Pasquale \u201cNino\u201d Perrotta \u2014 who reports suggest was a willing partner in Pruitt's spending on travel and security \u2014 sat down with staff from the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday for several hours. Staffers declined to comment on the substance of that interview, but an aide said Democratic staffers took part in the transcribed session and have access to the documents EPA has shared with the committee.  Story Continued Below  The administrator has maintained a low profile this week. He was not sighted at a swearing-in of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which several of Pruitt\u2019s fellow Cabinet members \u2014 like Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke \u2014 attended. Still, other newly issued documents offered a fresh look into his lobbyist and industry ties. The emails, which were released via a public records request from the Sierra Club, showed consultant and Global Impact Inc. CEO Matthew C. Freedman helped to set the itinerary for a planned trip to Australia for Pruitt, though it was eventually canceled when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.  In the emails, Freedman warned EPA officials that Pruitt could get an angry reception from Australian officials who disagreed with the Trump administration on climate change. \u201cI think that the trip will be more hostile than what the Administrator may be expecting,\u201d wrote Freedman, who now runs an advisory firm and is treasurer of the American Australian Council, a nonprofit whose members include Chevron, BHP and ConocoPhillips. POLITICO's Alex Guill\u00e9n reports more on the details of the documents here. A draft schedule for the trip also included a visit and public appearance at the Australian parliament, though it noted such a stop raised \u201cpotential for protests, negative reaction.\u201d Trips to the Great Barrier Reef and Tasmania were also panned, dubbed a \"bridge too far.\"  More to come? Democratic Sens. Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse contended on Wednesday there were at least 3,100 pages of communications between Pruitt and special interest groups during his time as Oklahoma's AG that now have business before the agency and have yet to be released. In a letter to Pruitt and federal ethics officials, the pair says, the records, disclosed in state court proceedings, include 1,122 pages of \u201cemails containing documents, amicus briefs, and legal strategy which are part of litigation files.\"  Grain of salt: Of course, Pruitt still has the support of the president, who has yet to weigh in publicly since Pruitt's testimony last week. And Sen. Jim Inhofe, a vocal ally of Pruitt, told a reporter from The Oklahoman that he believes Pruitt still has President Donald Trump's support. \"That\u2019s the way President Trump is. He makes up his mind,\" Inhofe told Justin Wingerter. \"It\u2019s kind of like Jeff Sessions ... about five different times I thought he was going to fire him and he never did.\"  GOOD THURSDAY MORNING!

POLL: VOTERS TURN ON PRUITT: Respondents in a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll turned more sharply negative on Pruitt after being told that he \u201cis under investigation for ethical infractions related to the amount of taxpayer money he has spent while in office, specifically on travel, his security detail and pay raises for his personal aides.\u201d Respondents were also informed that Pruitt testified before Congress that \u201che delegated authority to make spending decisions to members of his staff.\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Steven Shepard breaks down how after being told that information, 59 percent of respondents said Pruitt had not conducted himself appropriately. Far fewer, 11 percent, said Pruitt had acted appropriately.  Also in the poll: A slight majority \u2014 53 percent \u2014 said Pruitt should be removed from his position as EPA administrator, while 12 percent said he shouldn't be removed.

BISHOP TO TRAVEL TO PUERTO RICO: House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop is traveling to Puerto Rico this week to survey the island\u2019s recovery in the aftermath of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, he said Wednesday. \u201cThis trip will help me better understand the continuing challenges and what disaster relief is still needed,\u201d the chairman said in a statement. Bishop is set to meet with Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez while there.  Separately, Democratic Rep. Don Beyer requested a hearing on the status of the territory's recovery in a brief letter to Bishop, writing the \"committee has been silent,\" on a host of issues including the island-wide blackout and the privatization of PREPA, among other topics. A spokeswoman for Bishop called Beyer\u2019s claim that the committee had been silent \u201cabsolutely baseless, half-baked and politically motivated,\u201d noting that the committee has held multiple hearings, forums and sent letters on the topic.  MAIL CALL! THE ISDS OF MAY: API, NAM, the Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined together in a letter to President Donald Trump and other Cabinet officials on Wednesday on NAFTA, noting that though they support \u201cefforts to modernize NAFTA to grow the U.S. economy and support American jobs\u201d they want the administration to retain the investment protections and the investor-state dispute settlement.

FOR YOUR RADAR: BLM on Wednesday released draft environmental impact statements for proposed changes to greater sage-grouse conservation plans in Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Oregon. Conservation groups say the amendments largely ignore the hundreds of thousands of public comments that were submitted to BLM asking the Obama-era plans be left alone. But a spokesperson for Interior told the Associated Press the proposed changes are largely technical in nature and arrived via feedback the agency received about the 2015 plans from governors in sage grouse states.

FREEZE FRAME: The administration\u2019s plan to freeze CAFE standards at 2020 levels through 2025 would have an impact on fuel economy, oil consumption and GHG emissions, according to a new report today from Rhodium\u2019s U.S. Climate Service. The report found that freezing CAFE standards at 2020 levels would increase oil consumption in the U.S. by between 126,000 and 283,000 barrels per day in 2025, depending on oil prices. By 2030, the report finds, that impact would be 221,000-644,000, when assuming no change in post-2025 standards. Read the report here.  HAPPY SMALL BUSINESS WEEK: The Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions Forum will launch a video series today on U.S. clean energy companies that have benefited from ARPA-E funding. CRES Forum will begin the series with a video featuring Rita Hansen, CEO of Bend, Ore.-based Onboard Dynamics, a compressed natural gas refueling company. CRES Forum will roll out additional videos in the coming months. See today\u2019s video here.  CUSTOMERS ONLY: While many discussions on grid reliability and resiliency focus on the bulk power system, a new paper out Wednesday explored a \"customer-focused\" approach, recommending a broader framework focused on customers' experiences. The paper, which was prepared for the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, discusses how when viewed from a customer-centric framework, the power system should be seen end-to-end, reaching from the customer \"through distribution and transmission up to power generation and fuel supply.\" See it here.  HIGH WIND MARKS: American Wind Energy Association's recently released market report found that utility and non-utility customers signed contracts for 3,500 megawatts of U.S. wind capacity in the first quarter of 2018, a \"high water mark\" in recent years.

THAT'S ALL FOR ME!  ** A message from America\u2019s ethanol producers and farm supporters at Growth Energy: The boost from high-octane ethanol enhances engine performance and allows for more efficient engine designs. In fact, NASCAR drivers have been running on 15 percent ethanol blends since 2011. Today, E15 is approved for nine out of 10 cars on the road, and consumers have driven over five billion miles using E15. That\u2019s why America\u2019s biofuel leaders at Growth Energy are calling on the EPA to act quickly on the president\u2019s plan to unleash competition at the fuel pump and allow sales of E15 year-round.

The House Energy-Water subcommittee released the text of its draft appropriations bill Sunday night, aiming for $44.7 billion in spending \u2014 an increase of $1.5 billion from the fiscal year 2018 enacted level and $8.17 billion above President Donald Trump's slim budget request.  Overall, nuclear weapons activities and water infrastructure win big in the draft bill. The legislation would give The Army Corps of Engineers $7.28 billion, an increase of $451 million above 2018 to strengthen the nation's water infrastructure, and nuclear weapons activities getting an extra $558 million, to $11.2 billion. DOE's energy programs score $13.4 billion, an increase of more than $500 million above the current year, with $58 million of that increase is targeted for fossil energy technology research, while nuclear energy research gets a bump of $128 million. In contrast, energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, which the panel says \"have already received significant investments in recent years\" are cut by $243 million.  Story Continued Below  On the policy front, the bill includes the perennial rider to repeal the Waters of the United States rule, as well as language that seeks to block a court-ordered change in operations of dams along the Columbia and Snake River systems that prioritize endangered salmon over hydropower production. Annie Snider reports more here for Pros.  Other key numbers in the bill:  \u2014 $117 million for research and development to strengthen the electric grid. That's $41 million above the 2018 levels.  \u2014 $267.7 million to support the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository (more on that further down), an increase of $100 million above the president's budget request.  \u2014 $6.9 billion for environmental management activities, which marks a $257 million decrease from 2018 enacted level and $268 million above Trump's request. That money includes $5.8 billion for Defense Environmental Cleanup to cleanup sites contaminated by previous nuclear weapons production.  The bill text arrives a day before the subcommittee is set to mark up the fiscal 2019 spending bill. House Republicans have previously said they plan to hold stand-alone votes on noncontroversial fiscal 2019 appropriations bills, such as the Energy and Water title, over the summer. The hope is that \u2014 unlike last year \u2014 the Senate will also agree to take up at least some of those individual bills, handing the GOP-led Congress a small victory before the midterms. So far, the Senate has not announced plans to mark up its own version of the legislation. Pro\u2019s Budget and Appropriations' gurus Sarah Ferris and Kaitlyn Burton point out that already this is a faster pace for appropriators. Energy-Water wasn\u2019t completed until July 12 last year, but could easily clear the full committee this time around before the Memorial Day recess.  If you go: The House Appropriations Energy-Water Subcommittee will meet today to mark up the appropriations bill at 5:30 p.m. in 2362-B Rayburn.  MONDAY, MONDAY, MONDAY!

PRUITT\u2019S POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT: The man who could take over for Scott Pruitt if he were to fall to current swirling scandals is a longtime Washington insider and coal lobbyist, with a reputation for working well with both friends and adversaries, Pro\u2019s Eric Wolff reports. Andrew Wheeler, a former energy lobbyist and top aide to Sen. Jim Inhofe, would likely pursue Pruitt\u2019s same agenda \u2014 but without the additional baggage that Pruitt has brought. That poses a paradox for greens who wish to oust Pruitt but fear Wheeler could be a more formidable opponent. \u201cWheeler is much smarter, and will try to keep his efforts under the radar in implementing Trump\u2019s destructive agenda,\u201d said Jeremy Symons, vice president for political affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cThat should scare anyone who breathes.\u201d Read more.  \u2014 Axios reported Sunday that the president is unhappy with a report in The Atlantic that alleges a member of EPA's press team planted stories about Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in order to distract from his boss. A source told the outlet that the president raised the issue in conversation, calling it \"not good.\" And on Friday, Axios reports, Pruitt had lunch with four members of his team at Ambar restaurant on Capitol Hill. A lobbyist tweeted a picture of the gathering, which came as a surprise to EPA senior staff, many of whom have been frozen out of Pruitt's inner circle.  BLANKENSHIP GAINS IN WEST VIRGINIA: Tuesday marks primary elections in four states: Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina and West Virginia. In the latter, coal baron and former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship is reportedly edging to the front. Four Republicans tell POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt that they'd reviewed recent polling that shows Blankenship, who spent a year in jail after an explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine that killed 29 workers, moving narrowly ahead of his more mainstream GOP rivals, Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. They caution the surveys were conducted over a brief period of time and only offer a snapshot of the primary race \u2014 potentially overstating Blankenship\u2019s standing.  Still, many within the Republican Party worry that a Blankenship win on Tuesday could spell trouble in their attempt to take Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's seat come November. The president weighed in this morning, tweeting that Blankenship \u201ccan\u2019t win the General Election in your State...No way!\u201c Morrisey's campaign, who had largely ignored attacking Blankenship, on Saturday released a 30-second robocall blasting Blankenship over an array of issues. Read more.  Not out of options: Blankenship told CBS News on Sunday that he would not rule out a third party bid if Morrisey wins the Republican nomination. \"I have not ruled out anything,\" Blankenship said, adding, \"I've said that I cannot let him win because of the opioid connection and Planned Parenthood connection.\"  THE FINAL COUNTDOWN? Trump is expected to hold yet another meeting \u2014 and possibly his last \u2014 on the Renewable Fuel Standard this week, sources in the biofuel and refining industries tell Pro\u2019s Eric Wolff. It\u2019ll be the seventh meeting of its kind. Trump will host Sens. Chuck Grassley, Joni Ernst, Ted Cruz and Pat Toomey on Tuesday. Ahead of the meeting, this open letter to the president will run in today\u2019s editions of The New York Times, New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, calling on Trump to \u201cunleash rural growth by cutting the red tape holding back homegrown energy.\u201d The full-page ads were placed by Growth Energy and signed by member plants from 18 states.  ** A message from America\u2019s ethanol producers and farm supporters at Growth Energy: President Trump agrees that it\u2019s time to lift restrictions on year-round sales of E15, a higher-octane fuel blend with 15 percent ethanol. Biofuels deliver greater performance, less pollution, and more miles per dollar \u2013 a winning combination. Learn more at https://e15now.com **  TRUMP TO MEET WITH AUTOMAKERS: Trump is also scheduled to meet Friday with automaker CEOs for a roundtable event at the White House. Reuters reports that CEOs from General Motors, Ford and Toyota are among the companies invited. The meeting comes at a crucial time for the administration, given its plans to roll back greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars. Several states have already sued EPA over the move, but it notably came after automakers lobbied the Trump administration to revisit the 2022-25 emissions standards. Automakers had indicated they simply wanted more flexibility to reach the ultimate emissions goals in 2025, complaining that would be difficult to meet the Obama-era goals that would have ultimately lifted the average fuel economy target for the nation\u2019s fleet of cars and light trucks to 55 miles per gallon by 2025. Bloomberg reported last week that \u201cexecutives plan to encourage the president to agree with California on measured adjustments to the standards rather than a major rollback\u201d during this week\u2019s meeting.  HOUSE RULES TAKES UP YUCCA BILL: The House Rules Committee is set to take up the bipartisan nuclear waste bill, H.R. 3053 (115), on Tuesday. The long-delayed legislation, introduced by Illinois Rep. John Shimkus (R), amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, updating how the U.S. handles nuclear waste. It would allow the Energy Department to open an interim nuclear waste storage facility while regulators work out a permanent Yucca Mountain repository. Lawmakers have already made changes to the legislation to address the concerns of House appropriators, who held up floor consideration for months over language in the bill that would've limited their ability to specify how money from the Nuclear Waste Fund is spent.  \u2014 For your radar: Democratic Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen filed an amendment to the bill on Friday to stop the DOE from taking action related to the planning and development of a repository until the director of the Office of Management and Budget submits a study to Congress on the economic viability and benefits of alternative uses of the site.  PERRY, ZINKE RETURN TO THE HILL: Both Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry will appear on Capitol Hill this week. Zinke is slated to testify before the Senate Appropriations Interior-Environment Subcommittee on Thursday, an aide told Pro\u2019s Anthony Adragna. Perry will testify a day sooner on Wednesday, this time before the House Science Committee on his department\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019.  \u2014 Perry is also expected to appear at the annual Washington Conference of the Americas on Tuesday to talk \u201cenergy integration in the Americas.\u201d  SPEAKING OF: Former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz is one of several speakers selected to deliver addresses at this year\u2019s Georgetown University commencement ceremonies on May 17, the university announced. Moniz, now CEO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, will speak before the McCourt School of Public Policy.  OFFICE SUPPLIES: In letters to the chairmen of each chamber\u2019s Energy-Water Appropriations subcommittees, Eric Fygi, DOE's deputy general counsel, outlined renovations to the James Forrestal Building that have taken place since the beginning of the Trump administration, as well as renovations made during the previous administration. The letters aim to defend the department\u2019s reporting and approval process in light of an April GAO report that Fygi writes \u201cintroduced ambiguity as to what expenditures require Congressional notification.\u201d The letters to Sen. Lamar Alexander and Rep. Mike Simpson say DOE spent $4,652 for reupholstering furniture and painting in Perry\u2019s office and $4,993 for Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette\u2019s office.  HARTS FINED FOR PRUITT CONDO: Vicki and Steven Hart \u2014 the lobbyist couple whose condo was leased to Pruitt for $50 a night \u2014 paid a $2,034 fine Friday for wrongly renting out the property, a spokesman for the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs told POLITICO. \u201cThe owner agreed to pay the fine for engaging in a business without a housing residential license,\u201d the spokesman said.  MAIL CALL! MARKEY HAS SOME QUESTIONS: Democratic Sen. Ed Markey wrote to Pruitt Friday, asking for more information on the role of lobbyists and non-governmental individuals in scheduling his international trips. The letter comes after The Washington Post detailed how the EPA chief drew up a list of at least a dozen countries he wanted to visit and urged his aides to help him find official reasons to travel, soliciting political allies to help make the trips happen. \u201cThe outsized role you have given lobbyists and non-governmental individuals in setting both your domestic policy agenda as well as your international travel is concerning and leads to even more questions about your ability to objectively serve the American people,\u201d Markey writes. Read it here.  \u2014 Colorado Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Oversight Subcommittee, called on Pruitt to provide further details regarding his real estate dealings with lobbyists while attorney general of Oklahoma. Read that letter here.  \u2014 California Rep. Raul Ruiz and 37 other Democratic lawmakers signed onto a letter last week in opposition of the reopening of the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan.  BANKS ADDED TO CLEARPATH BOARD: ClearPath announced new members of its advisory board today including George David Banks, the former climate and international energy adviser to Trump who resigned in February after failing to secure a security clearance. Since then, Banks was named executive vice president of the American Council for Capital Formation and an adjunct research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy. ClearPath also announced Ed Holland, the former president and CEO of Southern Company Holdings; Richard Mroz, former president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities; and Terry Sullivan, founding partner of Firehouse Strategies, are joining the board.  BISHOP BACKS PUERTO RICO STATEHOOD: House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop endorsed Puerto Rico\u2019s effort to become the 51st state in the U.S. while he was visiting the territory Friday. \u201cI want to be very clear: I'm very supportive of Puerto Rico statehood,\u201d Bishop, whose committee oversees Puerto Rico, said at a press conference in San Juan. Pro\u2019s Colin Wilhelm reports here on how Bishop\u2019s backing will increase momentum for a renewed political push for a change to the island\u2019s status, but came with some caveats. Bishop \u2014 who plans to leave Congress in 2020 \u2014 said he wants Puerto Rico to recover from the longer-term economic issues that have plagued the U.S. territory for the last decade, and noted that \u201cpreconditions\u201d around that economic recovery would have to be met before statehood could move forward.

                              "text": "Considered a toss-up in the midterm elections, the West Virginia Senate race is one where Republicans hope to have the chance to unseat incumbent Joe Manchin, a Democrat who first won the seat in a 2010 special election.  According to a Fox News poll, three Republicans are considered to be \u201ctop tier\u201d candidates ahead of the May 8 primary: Don Blankenship, Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey. Jenkins, a U.S. congressman, topped the list of Republican contenders.  Earlier this month, the candidates faced off in a Fox News debate, with each one trying to align himself with the president more so than the next. All three also maligned Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe.  Manchin is not running unopposed; he races a primary challenger in Paula Jean Swearengin, an environmental activist whose platform is more in line with Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont.  President Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 40 points in the Mountain State in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has urged voters to support either Morrisey or Jenkins, saying Blankenship could not win the general election.  From their focus on former President Barack Obama\u2019s policies to their courtship of coal workers, here\u2019s a look at the top three Republicans competing for the GOP nomination today.  Don Blankenship  Don Blankenship, 68, was imprisoned in a federal jail for a year in 2016 after he was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety and health standards -- and he\u2019s still fighting the conviction, blaming the Obama administration every step of the way.  Blankenship, the former head of Massey Energy Company, calls the 2010 explosion that killed 29 people at the company\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine the \u201cworst tragedy of my life.\u201d  Blankenship has sought to have his conviction thrown out, and he\u2019s promoted a pamphlet he wrote in prison that he said sheds light on his prosecution, the explosion and an Obama administration conspiracy against him. He\u2019s also compared the tragedy to that of the 2012 Benghazi attack, calling the blast \u201cObama\u2019s deadliest cover-up\u201d in a campaign ad.  He\u2019s been called the \u201cvillain of our times,\u201d compared to failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and dubbed \u201cthe most hated man in West Virginia.\u201d He\u2019s also been the nearly $745,000 target of the Mountain Families PAC which opposes his Senate campaign.  Despite running for Senate in West Virginia, his primary residence, according to The New York Times, is a $2.4 million home near Las Vegas.  As a candidate, Blankenship has a goal of hosting town hall meetings in every one of West Virginia's 55 counties, according to Politico Magazine. He\u2019s resonating with voters such as Rev. Becky Deitch, the chairwoman of the Brooke County GOP who told Politico, \u201cThe common man doesn\u2019t want another politician. I could tell from his handshake. He\u2019s real.\u201d  \u201cI think the big issue in West Virginia is jobs, and I\u2019m the guy that created a lot of jobs in West Virginia and neither of my \u2026 opponents did,\u201d Blankenship told Fox News. He also said he\u2019s \u201cbetter positioned\u201d to deal with the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic that has hit West Virginia particularly hard since his company dealt with workers who struggled with drugs.  A supporter of Trump, Blankenship advocates for building a border wall and ending so-called sanctuary cities.  However, Trump has urged voters not to support Blankenship, saying that he could not win the general election. That lack of support hasn't seemed to phase Blankenship, though.  \"Neither of my opponents can beat Joe Manchin without my support, but I will beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment,\" he said in a statement to Fox News. \"West Virginia voters should remember that my enemies are Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and my opponents would not even be running as Republicans had I not resurrected the Republican Party in West Virginia.\"  \"As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it,\" Blankenship said of the president's tweet.  Blankenship got into some hot water during his campaign when he said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s father-in-law is a \u201cwealthy China person.\u201d He has accused McConnell of creating jobs for \u201cChina people\u201d and said his \u201cChina family\u201d has given him millions of dollars.  McConnell has been married to Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, since 1993. Chao was born in Taiwan, and her father was born in China.  Blankenship denied the comment was a \u201ctarget on his family,\u201d but rather an \u201cobservation that Mitch\u2019s family is very well-connected in China.\u201d  In Fox News' poll of Republican Senate candidates, Blankenship came in third with 16 percent of likely voters saying they would select him. Still, 24 percent of voters remain undecided, according to the poll.  Evan Jenkins  Rep. Evan Jenkins has been a congressman for only three years, but before that, he served as a state senator in West Virginia for 12 years.  Jobs, coal, senior citizens and the Second Amendment are all important issues to Jenkins, according to his campaign website. He also focused on his anti-abortion record in his first television advertisement.  Jenkins, 57, helped create the nonprofit Lily\u2019s Place, a facility that cares for newborns who are born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which occurs when babies are exposed to drugs while still in the womb.  Jenkins has made a point in his campaign to distance Manchin, one of the more conservative Democrats in Washington, from Trump. However, Jenkins, too, used to be a Democrat. He switched to the GOP in 2013. But that wasn\u2019t his only party switch; Jenkins was first a registered Republican until 1993, according to Roll Call.  As for jobs, Jenkins stressed the importance of coal growing the local economy in an interview with the Herald-Dispatch. He said he\u2019s worked with Trump on easing Obama-era regulations on the coal industry and has supported additional funding for clinics and healthcare services for miners who suffer from \u201cblack lung disease.\u201d  Jenkins told Fox News West Virginia needs a \u201cnew voice\u201d to represent the state in the U.S. Senate.  \u201cThere\u2019s a clear choice,\u201d Jenkins said of the race. He accused Blankenship of \u201cusing his checkbook\u201d to launch a \u201cvendetta\u201d campaign that\u2019s all about his name. As for the state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, another Senate candidate, Jenkins called him \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d \u201cin the swamp\u201d and for the opioid industry.  Jenkins has also stressed during the campaign that he supported Trump in the presidential primary, as opposed to the other candidates.  \"We're starting to see hope and opportunity come back to West Virginia,\" Jenkins told Fox News, saying voters want someone \"who's getting the job done, working with President Trump, bringing this renewed sense of confidence as proud West Virginians.\"  Jenkins leads the field of Republicans in Fox News' poll with 25 percent of likely voters saying they support him. However, 24 percent of voters are still undecided.  Patrick Morrisey  Patrick Morrisey is the first Republican to serve as attorney general in West Virginia since 1933, his campaign website boasts. First elected to serve in the position in 2012, he was re-elected in 2016.  Now Morrisey has his sights set on the U.S. Senate.  In his campaign, Morrisey, 50, has harped on his efforts as attorney general to curtail the state\u2019s opioid epidemic. He sued the Drug Enforcement Administration, saying it allows companies to not take into account patients\u2019 needs when selling drugs. And his office has reached settlements with pharmaceutical distributors for about $47 million, the largest in the state\u2019s history, according to his campaign website.  But his past work as a health care attorney and his wife\u2019s work as a lobbyist who has represented several pharmaceutical clients, including those involved in opioids, have come under scrutiny.  His wife\u2019s lobbying firm was also paid $460,000 by Planned Parenthood, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported last year. Morrisey has said he is staunchly anti-abortion, opposing taxpayer dollars going to Planned Parenthood and supporting repealing Roe v. Wade.  In an interview with Fox News, Morrisey said he's worked with Trump to get rid of some Obama administration regulations and to \"go after\" sanctuary cities. He said he has an \"excellent\" relationship with the president.  \"As voters focus the last two weeks, they're going to learn who is the proven conservative,\" Morrisey said, calling Jenkins a \"political opportunist\" who \"stands for nothing.\"  Morrisey has been endorsed by the conservative National Review, which heralded him as a \u201crock-solid, independent-minded conservative who would be a valuable addition to the right flank of the Republican caucus.\u201d  Morrisey has also been endorsed by Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas.  He is just behind Jenkins, according to Fox News' poll, with 21 percent of likely voters throwing their support behind the attorney general.

                              "text": "By Matt Vasilogambros  On the day of Arizona\u2019s 2016 presidential primary, the line outside the Maryvale Church of the Nazarene, the Maricopa County polling place for 213,000 mostly Latino, low-income people, extended through the parking lot, down busy North 51st Avenue, and into a neighborhood lined with palm and eucalyptus trees on the western edge of Phoenix.  Some voters waited for four hours or more in the 80-degree heat to cast their ballots, according to Martin Quezada, a Democrat who represents the area in the Arizona Senate. Quezada said the long wait time was more than an inconvenience.  Latino voters don\u2019t trust the system, Quezada said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have a good experience on Election Day when they are casting their ballot, their likelihood of participating in a system they don\u2019t trust again in the future becomes that much harder.\u201d  Across the country, elections officials are marshaling data on registered voters, historic turnout, parking spaces and other information to reduce wait times at polling places. Also helping to decrease wait times is voting by mail, which is available in 22 states, and early voting, which is now offered in 37 states \u2014 though a couple of states have rolled back their early voting.  But white voters are benefiting far more from such innovations than Hispanic or black voters are. As the nation gears up for what is shaping up to be a high-energy midterm election this November, the disparity is likely to loom large.  In the 2016 presidential election, black voters, on average, waited 16 minutes to vote, while Latino voters waited 13 minutes, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey of voters. In the same election, white voters waited 10 minutes. In 2012, black and Latino voters stood in line for more than 20 minutes to cast their ballot, nearly twice as long as white voters.  Stephen Pettigrew, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, has found if there are two neighborhoods in the same city, and one is majority-white and the other has more blacks and Hispanics, voters in the white neighborhood have a shorter wait.  Voting rights advocates call the disparity a \u201ctime tax.\u201d They argue that it violates the fundamental right to vote \u2014 and that it is often intentional.  \u201cWe are in a state of threat to voting rights,\u201d said Denise Lieberman, co-director of the Power and Democracy program at the Washington, D.C.-based Advancement Project, a civil rights organization. \u201cSome actions, like changing polling places, may seem benign on its face, but they are creating havoc.\u201d  Fewer Resources  In poorer counties and cities, long lines may stem from a lack of resources. But even in wealthier counties, minority communities tend to get fewer polling places, voting machines and poll workers than white neighborhoods in the same county, according to a 2014 study from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cMinority precincts have tended to get the short end of the resource allocation stick,\u201d the study concluded.  Lieberman argues that in many counties, election officials are less inclined to provide minority communities with the resources that can shorten lines.  It\u2019s one of many policies that are \u201ccreating a climate of discrimination,\u201d Lieberman said, in the same vein as restrictive voter ID laws, the slashing of early voting in states like Florida and North Carolina, and the consolidation of polling places, all of which adversely affect communities of color. Local officials and state lawmakers are trying to suppress the minority vote, Lieberman said.  \u201cNone of this is a coincidence,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThe folks who pass these laws know their impact. \u2026 Communities of color bear the brunt of a lack of legal protection.\u201d  In North Carolina, a federal court agreed in 2016, saying many of the state\u2019s restrictive voting laws, including strict voter ID requirements and a rollback of early voting, \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d North Carolina lawmakers said the laws were passed to protect state elections against fraud and to save counties money.  Cutting Voting Lines  Local election officials know how to keep voting lines short, which makes this time gap so frustrating for voting scholars such as Charles Stewart III, the director of MIT\u2019s Voting Technology Project.  U.S. voters\u2019 wait time shrank to 11 minutes in the 2016 presidential election, down from 14 minutes in 2012, according to MIT\u2019s quadrennial survey. Further, the survey found, fewer voters waited more than an hour to cast their ballot than in the previous election. County officials should be using best-practice tools to decrease wait times in all precincts regardless of their racial makeup, Stewart said.  Many of those tools were implemented after the 2012 presidential election, where hellish voting lines in states such as Florida made national news. (On average, according to MIT\u2019s survey, it took Florida voters 46 minutes to cast their ballots that year.) President Barack Obama took notice, and in 2013 he appointed a bipartisan commission, led by the chief lawyers from his campaign and Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign, to solve the issues that plagued the country\u2019s electoral system.  One of the commission\u2019s primary recommendations was to use data, such as voter registration numbers and parking availability near polling places, to better manage polling places, which would in turn decrease the size of lines. The commission\u2019s goal was to make sure no American ever waits more than a half-hour to vote.  Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the nonprofit Democracy Fund and a member of the commission, said that because election officials are following its recommendations, \u201cthe preponderance of lines is going down.\u201d  Stewart, for his part, launched an online \u201ctoolkit,\u201d which he said is now used by a quarter of the country\u2019s local election officials to help them deploy enough poll booths, poll workers and ballot scanners to handle Election Day voting.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not gathering that data,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cyou\u2019re running blind.\u201d  Michael Scarpello, the registrar of voters in San Bernardino County, California, has embraced that lesson.  To serve the largest geographic county in the contiguous 48 states, Scarpello and his analytics department take a large swath of data \u2014 registered voters, historic turnout, parking spaces, voter behavior, capacity of polling places \u2014 to assign poll workers, distribute supplies\u00ad\u00ad and assign voters to specific polling locations, freeing up busy locations and utilizing underused places. Using this data, Scarpello is able to update polling place capacity by the hour in a county of nearly 900,000 registered voters.  \u201cIf there are lines, they are short,\u201d Scarpello said. At most, voters wait five minutes.  The county\u2019s immediate response to Election Day voter behavior lowers the length of lines, the cost of elections, and the time it takes to count ballots. Between 2008 and 2016, the county cut its ballot-counting time nearly in half, from 16 hours to nine, Scarpello said.  \u201cOur job is to make voting as convenient as possible for voters,\u201d Scarpello said. \u201cIf voters are motivated, we don\u2019t want to put any barriers in their way.\u201d  Closing the Gap  Voting lines in Orange County, California, never surpass nine minutes, said Neal Kelley, the county\u2019s registrar of voters. That\u2019s significant because the county is the fifth-largest voting jurisdiction in the country and because a third of the electorate is Latino.  There is no difference in wait times between Orange County\u2019s majority-white Newport Beach and majority-Latino Santa Ana, Kelley said. Countywide, the average wait time for voters dropped drastically in recent years after Kelley began using sophisticated data techniques to change how they allocate the county\u2019s 11,000 voting booths and 9,000 poll workers among 1,300 polling places.  As the county prepares for a potentially competitive congressional election for 15-term Republican U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s seat this November, Kelley said he\u2019s relying on data from 2010, the last hotly contested midterm election, to estimate turnout for this one.  Kelley said he will monitor precincts closely on Election Day. \u201cOne booth could make all the difference in the world.\u201d  In Maricopa County, where Quezada and his neighbors waited so long to vote in 2016, the official in charge of that election has paid a price.  Helen Purcell, then Maricopa County\u2019s recorder since 1989, had reduced the number of polling places for the 2016 primary, recommending 60 polling places in the fourth-largest county in the United States, down from 200 in 2012.  In the aftermath of the election, The Arizona Republic found that low-income, Latino neighborhoods bore the brunt of the decrease. Purcell, a Republican, denied that race was a motivating factor, but she faced widespread criticism and lost her reelection bid to Democrat Adrian Fontes, who became the first Latino elected as Maricopa County recorder.  After he won, Fontes promised that actions that might limit the Latino vote in future elections will be \u201cvery vigilantly avoided.\u201d",

                              "text": "The Color of the Wave to be Determined by Those Most Afraid  November 2nd, 2018  TheTollOnline.com  Read by 3,105 people Doug \"Uncola\" LynnNovember 2nd, 2018 This article was originally published by Doug \u201cUncola\u201d Lynn at TheTollOnline.com Regarding the upcoming election on Tuesday November 6, 2018, there can only be one of three possible outcomes: 1.) Blue Wave 2.) Red Wave 3.) No Wave The third result would, of course, be manifested as dramatic wins and losses for both Republicans and Democrats with either party coming out slightly ahead overall. But given the perceived high stakes of this particular election as a referendum on President Donald Trump, the winners will be determined by those voters who fear the most. Certainly, there is much anger in this election, and that\u2019s what happens: When people become scared, they get angry. Trump supporters fear losing their nation to globalism, open borders, offshoring, and politically correct fascism; which is just another name for Cultural Marxism. Liberal Democrats on the other hand, don\u2019t fear for America, per se, but rather their collective existence which requires everything mentioned heretofore that Trump supporters will vote against. In other words, on Tuesday, some Americans will be voting for national sovereignty and to uphold the U.S. Constitution, whereas others will vote for a new world order, globalist orthodoxies, and economic redistribution by means of a powerful centralized government. Regardless of who wins, however, there remains the possibility that the allegorical train has already left the proverbial station. Or stated another way, it may be America is already gone. Consider the fact that U.S. corporations are now fascist. Four months after Donald Trump was elected, The Washington Post adopted its slogan \u201cDemocracy Dies in the Darkness\u201d. That is, in fact, downright Orwellian because the titan, Jeff Bezos, attended the Bilderberg conference in Watford, Hertfordshire, England in June of 2013 and purchased the Washington Post four months later, in October 2013. Within six months, even the liberal Huffington Post reported concerns over Bezos\u2019 collusion with the United States Central Intelligence Agency: The Post is supposed to expose CIA secrets. But Amazon is under contract to keep them. Amazon has a new $600 million \u201ccloud\u201d computing deal with the CIA. The situation is unprecedented\u2026. American journalism has entered highly dangerous terrain. Of course, the Washington Post had been a CIA Mockingbird publication for some time, under the stewardship of its previous owner Katharine Graham. And, today, internet social media companies like Twitter and Facebook have also aligned with the Democrats, on behalf of the powerful, centralized state. Even the world\u2019s largest online search engine company, Google, uses the tagline \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d. It\u2019s just another Orwellian mind-trick because the CIA made Google: In reality, Google is a smokescreen behind which lurks the US military-industrial complex. Therefore, it is no surprise that Republican candidates have had their ads censored by the online behemoth during this election season. As of this writing, the most recent example of the \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d company\u2019s digital warfare on a GOP candidate took place on Tuesday October 30, 2018 when the following ad for Rep Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn) was obviously deemed too effective for Google\u2019s liking: \ufeff Hopefully, the reader will be able to view the 30 second video before Google\u2019s YouTube platform takes it down. In a free nation, when corporations like Nike go full Kaepernick, we don\u2019t have to buy their shoes. And since Google really IS evil, we can just use another search engine. Even better, in a free country, entrepreneurs can start up competitive companies and let the free-market sort it all out, right? Wrong. The online platform Gab was an alternative to Twitter and now it\u2019s gone. The excuse? A psycho shooting up a synagogue in Pittsburgh \u2013 although those who politicized that event obviously cared more for negating American\u2019s First and Second Amendment rights than for those murdered. Gab says they\u2019ll be back soon. We\u2019ll see. In any case, in a free nation, their viability should never have been questioned, let alone challenged, over unrelated circumstances. During Brett Kavanuagh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination process, the Democrats also completely bared their collective asses and looked like rats and fools to common sense Americans. When polls began to show an energized Republican base about to neutralize any hope for a Blue Wave, the Orwellian Media quickly switched channels to show the slow-motion Latin American invasion. When that backfired as well, what happened next? Shock and awe anarchy committed by a Cuban-Caucasian Native American Deplorable and an Anti-semitic Caucasian Never Trumper. Do you believe in coincidences? Next, the Orwellian Media reported the mail-bomber, and synagogue shooter, as exemplifying the decline of America under Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric and divisive politics. In response, Trump doubled down on the Orwellian Media as the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d: There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly. That will do much to put out the flame\u2026 \u2026.of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony. Fake News Must End! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2018 Whether or not the white Native-American mail-bomber was a patsy, or leftist operative, and even if the anti-Semitic synagogue shooter was a MK Ultra asset who answered his phone at just the right time \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters most is how these types of events are always politicized by the Political Left and morphed into mind-control by the Orwellian Media. They are, in fact, the enemy. Undoubtedly, the puppetmasters manipulate their puppets by perception. But it only works for so long because reality is inevitable. The science-fiction author, Philip K. Dick, once said: Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn\u2019t go away. Therefore, it\u2019s always a mere matter of time before the puppetmasters are seen as lying manipulators. Or, at the very least, the luckiest bastards ever to have published photos of a pristine white van, plastered with strangely unfaded pro-Trump stickers, owned by a whiter than average homeless Indian who just sent pipe-bombs to all of the modern-day heroes of the American Democratic Party. Immediately, cell phone news applications like \u201cFlipboard\u201d were sending out all of the right information to all of the left people: That the perp was a registered Republican, white-van-owner, and that\u2026 A White Van Laden With Stickers Is at Center of Bombing Investigation\u2026. One sticker has a Photoshopped image of President Trump standing on a tank, haloed by fireworks with an American flag behind him. \u201cDishonest Media,\u201d and \u201cCNN Sucks,\u201d reads another one, the cable network\u2019s logo affixed to it. And then there are the memes expressing support for the president and animosity toward his critics. At the same time, CNN was calling the bomb recipients \u201cTrump Targets\u201d as the Orwellian Media breathlessly reported on how the incident had curtailed Republican enthusiasm in the midterms. Also that the mail bomb story had successfully diverted attention from the Kavanaugh fiasco and the Honduran Caravan coverage; both of which we\u2019re perceived as galvanizing Republicans. By way of Tweet, Trump agreed: Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this \u201cBomb\u201d stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows \u2013 news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2018 Call this blogger a paranoid tin-foil-hatter, but the whole Cesar Sayok Deplorable Mail-Bombermovie of the week seemed reminiscent of the Kavanaugh debacle. It was a classic in-your-face operation that screamed: \u201cLook what we can do whenever we want\u201d. At the same time, the failed bomb plot was perfect fodder to play as propaganda to the loony left who bought it all like they do Chinese junk on Black Friday. When the conservative internet personality, Alex Jones, was banned from social media last summer, both he and the internet activist, Mike Adams, predicted false flags were coming prior to the midterms. Adams exclaimed: For the last two months, I\u2019ve been warning about the rising risk of a major false flag attack taking place before the mid-term elections. The aggressive, unprecedented PURGE of Alex Jones / InfoWars underscores the desperation of the totalitarian deep state that\u2019s about to make a move to eliminate President Trump and / or steal the elections\u2026.. The radical Left is escalating its violence across America, and the tech giants are dramatically escalating their censorship actions to silence all independent voices that might question any \u201cofficial\u201d narrative. It all points to something big about to come down \u2014 something so big that only the official narrative can be allowed to be heard or spoken. Adams has since identified the process as first the \u201cvilification\u201d of Jones, then the \u201ccensorship\u201d, and then the operation as transitioned into the \u201ckinetic phase\u201d. We were also warned how the media shock and awe would be blamed on Donald Trump. Without fail, all of it happened over the last several days and, conveniently, just prior to the midterms. Adams\u2019 prediction is also very chilling regarding the Honduran Caravan being turned into a kill zone in the days before the election. Remember, Trump said he would send in the military and the mob would NOT be allowed into the U.S. There are now reports of 15,000 troops gathering on America\u2019s southern border. If Trump keeps the caravan out by force, the Orwellian Media will have a field day portraying Trump as Hitler and the illegal invaders as Jews queued up before the oven doors. At the same time, no questions will be raised as to how well-timed, coordinated, and sufficiently funded, was the caravan. And if Trump allows the mob to cross the border, then his word will be shown as no good to his base. Tricky business, indeed. Regardless, on any other week, NBC burying information that would have discredited Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers, and attorney Michael Avenatti being referred to the Department of Justice for investigation \u2013 would have been YUGE stories. But that\u2019s exactly how the Orwellian Media works. They emphasize various propagandic narratives while simultaneously tossing any contravening reporting right down the memory hole. It is nothing less than the electronic programming of the masses. Combine this with the censorship and memory-holed jettisoning of truth-tellers from online platforms, along with Google\u2019s biased search engine reporting \u2013 and if there is a Blue Wave in a few days, these will be the reasons. It seems heritage Americans, with their guns, now remain as the allegorical last man standing between the U.S. Constitution and all-out globalism. Drive down any city street, in any neighborhood, prior to the vote on November 6, 2018, and you\u2019ll see neighbors right next door to each other, and just across the street from one another, with opposing candidate signs in their windows and yards. This means these Americans are, literally, living and sleeping just yards away from their ideological enemies. We are now in the soap box phase. On Tuesday comes the ballot box phase. Then, regardless of outcome, we will very possibly enter into the bullet box phase. Of course, that\u2019s why the Orwellian Media requires endless news stories starring explosive projectile dispensers: To generate the necessary urgency to corner any criminals quickly followed by their immediate electronic prosecution, judgment, and sentencing. The Democrats are afraid of guns, so they only want a powerful centralized state to have them. They also fear not being able to abort their babies, the weather (i.e. Climate Change), and transgenders losing their Obama-ordained bathroom privileges with your wives and daughters. The Republicans fear the insanity of Democrats, the New World Order, and outcomes far more sinister than even Orwell imagined: The pulp fiction horror writer, H.P. Lovecraft, once said: The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown. And Donald Trump has stated: My whole life is about winning. I don\u2019t lose often. I almost never lose. The deck is stacked and the stage is set. Here\u2019s what losing might look like: Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker, Adam Schiff as Intelligence Committee Chairman, and Maxine Waters as head of the House Committee on Financial Services. Frightening prospects, indeed. But even if Trump and the Republicans hold the line, it will have been just another battle in the long war.

                              "text": "I'm just going to say it. The only people I've ever seen become truly violent are those aligned with Democrats. That's not saying all Democrats are violent, but those that would support them are mostly Marxists, which means the ends justifies the means. With that said, this news about pipe bombs going to key Democrats raises some suspicions just weeks ahead of the elections.  We're not talking about unknown Democrats here. We're talking the usurper Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah and Hillary Clinton, as well as fake news network CNN, who are nothing more than Communist useful idiots.  First, The New York Post reports:  take our poll - story continues below Who will cave first over the government shutdown? Who will cave first over the government shutdown?

The explosive device sent to CNN\u2019s New York headquarters was a pipe bomb and came with an envelope of white powder, police said Wednesday. \u201cResponding officers identified a device that appeared to be an explosive device and they removed it for investigation,\u201d NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said at a press conference outside the news network\u2019s Columbus Circle offices. \u201cAdditionally there was an envelope of white powder that was part of that packaging.\u201d The powder is being tested on site, while the device has been removed to the NYPD\u2019s firing range in the Bronx and will then be taken to the FBI\u2019s lab, officials added. The package was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan \u201cc/o CNN,\u201d the network says.  NYP then went on to report:  The NYPD busted out its rarely seen Total Containment Vessel to ferry a pipe bomb Wednesday from CNN\u2019s Midtown headquarters to The Bronx. Members of the department\u2019s elite Bomb Squad carefully loaded the device into the back of the TCV, mounting it onto a suspended net inside the chamber designed to minimize jostling on the tense ride north to the Rodman\u2019s Neck facility, police sources said. The TCV, which is mounted onto the back of a truck belonging to the NYPD\u2019s Emergency Service Unit, is engineered to withstand a blast from within should the device trigger during the trip, minimizing damage to those on the outside, sources said. Advance department vehicles blocked off a route north from Midtown to the Rodman\u2019s Neck facility, freeing up a path for the TCV to travel both quickly and with minimal risk to civilian motorists. Escorted by a convoy of emergency vehicles including an ESU truck and an ambulance, the TCV wound its way to the remote firing range and training facility, depositing its volatile cargo in the early afternoon.  Once everything was in the clear, CNN President and Trump friend-turned-foe Jeff Zucker decided to blame President Donald Trump's \"attacks on the media\" for the bomb scares.  In issuing a statement, Zucker wrote: \"There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their attacks on the media.\"  Hypocritically, he added, \"The President, and especially the White House Press Secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.\"  Interestingly enough, Zucker has never once spoke out like this about Maxine Waters and her calls for mobs to hound Republicans and Trump supporters in public and declare they aren't welcome.  What's even more suspicious is the fact that the alleged bombs were fake.  BREAKING: Authorities have determined that some of the bombs were FAKE, not operable, designed as an elaborate stunt \u2014 Paul Sperry (@paulsperry_) October 24, 2018  Not to mention, how does Mr. Zucker know this isn't their supporters or Antifa, which is also their supporters? They are the ones who actually condone violence against the innocent. Just look at the Holocaust of American bodies via the abortion industry that CNN and Democrats support nationally! We still haven't heard CNN condemn the violence encouraged by Democrats like Maxine Waters or the talk of assassinating a sitting president.  Speaking of Maxine Waters, Fox News reports:  A law enforcement source also tells Fox News that U.S. Capitol Police were investigating a suspicious package addressed to Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., at the Capitol Hill mail screening facility. In a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, Waters said Capitol Police had told her that \"my Washington, DC office was the target of a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI. \"I am appreciative of the law enforcement entities who intercepted the package and are investigating this matter,\" Waters added. \"I unequivocally condemn any and all acts of violence and terror.\"  To top it off, actor Jim Carrey painted a picture of a bomb in President Trump's mouth and tweeted, \"Today they tried to murder two Presidents as well as public servants and journalists. Make no mistake, these terrorists were encouraged and emboldened by the hate speech of Donald Trump. If you can\u2019t see the clear menace of this man\u2019s influence by now then you are a part of it.\"  Today they tried to murder two Presidents as well as public servants and journalists. Make no mistake, these terrorists were encouraged and emboldened by the hate speech of Donald Trump. If you can\u2019t see the clear menace of this man\u2019s influence by now then you are a part of it. pic.twitter.com/L7kYcpcPKO \u2014 Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) October 24, 2018  Carrey is a funny guy as an actor. Maybe he should simply stick to acting.  It's funny though, remember Hillary Clinton's statement that Democrats wouldn't be civil till they took back over the federal government?  \u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,\u201d Clinton said on CNN.  \u201cThat\u2019s why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that\u2019s when civility can start again,\u201d she added.  \u201cBut until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.\u201d  Holder similarly dismissed civility in politics, claiming that the new Democrat slogan is: \u201cWhen they go low, we kick them.\u201d  These are the people who have advocated for incivility and violence. Now, they are faking these bomb threats, which are my guess since most of them were fakes. Not one of them exploded. They are using it for political gains and nothing more.  President Trump also denounced the bombs as abhorrent.  \u201cIn these times, we have to unify, we have to come together, and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts and threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America,\u201d Trump said.  \u201cThis egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear as Americans,\u201d Trump continued.  \u201cWe are extremely angry, upset, unhappy about what we witnessed this morning and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d he added.  Even the first lady chimed in.  \u201cWe cannot tolerate these cowardly attacks and I strongly condemn those that choose violence,\u201d Melania Trump said.  Candace Owens also thinks the time of the bombs are suspicious.  \u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and state that there is a 0% chance that these \u201csuspicious packages\u201d were sent out by conservatives,\u201d she tweeted.  \u201cThe only thing \u201csuspicious\u201d about these packages, is their timing. Caravans, fake bomb threats\u2014these leftists are going ALL OUT for midterms,\u201d Owens added.  https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1055152462061957121  She's right. This is nothing more than political theater for those who get so caught up in what is nothing more than a WWE match to control the American people and undermine the US Constitution.  I might be inclined to think differently if one of the bombs had actually exploded when one of the recipients received it. Until then, political theater.",

                              "text": "VIdeo by CBS News  Voters head to the polls in four states to pick candidates for key House, Senate, and gubernatorial races.  The next big slate of primaries is up Tuesday, May 15. Voters in four states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska, Oregon, and Pennsylvania will head to the polls to select candidates for key congressional, Senate, and governor\u2019s races.  Pennsylvania will be the election headliner of the evening. The state is crucial for the Democrats to have a shot at retaking the House of Representatives in November, and Tuesday will set up match-ups for the midterms. There\u2019s also a heated GOP gubernatorial race in Idaho, and whoever wins the Republican primary will likely become the state\u2019s next governor.  Here\u2019s what to watch in every state.  Pennsylvania  Polls close: 8 pm Eastern time  Pennsylvania\u2019s primaries may be a preview of Democrats\u2019 national prospects in November. Both a new Congressional map and some open seats benefit the Democrats. Tuesday will set the general election contests and offer a clearer picture of Democrats\u2019 chances.  Three open seats in Republican-held districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 \u2014 Pennsylvania\u2019s Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh \u2014 offer solid opportunities for Democratic pickups.  There\u2019s also a few districts where Republican incumbents look shaky because they\u2019re facing primary challengers: the 11th, a heavily Trump-voting district where Rep. Lloyd Smucker faces a challenge from the right; and the 12th District, where Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko is running against incumbent Rep. Tom Marino, who faces questions over his ties to the opioid industry. The opioid crisis is the key issue in the race.  A Senate seat is also up for grabs. Incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will await his Republican midterm challenger. Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) and state Rep. Jim Christiana are battling it out. Casey will most likely defeat either one of them in the general, but Pennsylvania, which went for Trump in 2016, can be unpredictable.  Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is also up for reelection. He\u2019s the favorite to win in November, but depending on who wins the GOP primary, things could get interesting. The Republican candidates are state Sen. Scott Wagner; litigation attorney Laura Ellsworth; and a former paratrooper and consultant Paul Mango.  Slideshow by photo services  Idaho  Polls close: 8 pm Mountain time or Pacific time  Idaho\u2019s gubernatorial seat is wide open, after the Republican incumbent decided not to seek a fourth term. That led to a crowded GOP primary field, and three candidates have risen to the top: Brad Little, the current lieutenant governor and the establishment pick; Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID), a House Freedom Caucus founding member and the ultraconservative in the race; and Tommy Ahlquist, a former physician and real estate developer who\u2019s painting himself as the outsider.  Whoever wins the primary is almost guaranteed to sail to the governorship, which is why this primary race has become so contested \u2014 and expensive.  Democrats are mostly battling it out for the honor of losing to a Republican in November. But the contest is a microcosm of the larger divisions among Democrats. Paulette Jordan, a 38-year-old two-term Idaho state legislator, has won national endorsements from progressive groups, but the state\u2019s liberal establishment has mostly gotten behind A.J. Balukoff, an entrepreneur who launched a failed bid for governor in 2014.  \u00a9 Drew Angerer/Getty Images Rep. Raul Labrador, a candidate in the mix for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in Idaho.  Nebraska  Polls close: 8 pm Central time/7 pm Mountain time  Incumbent Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) is the favorite to win the general. But a female Democratic challenger, Jane Raybould, a Lincoln City Council member, could be a contender if she wins the Democratic primary. Both politicians are seen as able to work across the aisle. Fischer will still probably cruise to victory, but as Vox\u2019s Tara Golshan writes, \u201cif 2018 starts to get really weird, we\u2019ll have to check back in with the Cornhuskers.\u201d  There\u2019s also the potential for Democrats to reclaim a House seat in Nebraska\u2019s Second Congressional District, which includes Omaha and its suburbs. Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) won the seat in 2016, defeating then-incumbent Democrat Brad Ashford by a percentage point.  Ashford wants to repay the favor in 2018, and is running for the Democratic nomination. He\u2019s the frontrunner with name recognition but faces a strong progressive challenge from Kara Eastman, a nonprofit manager.  Both Ashford or Eastman will likely be competitive in the general against Bacon. The Cook Political Report rates Nebraska\u2019s Second as a toss-up.  Oregon  Polls close: Mail-in; ballots must be received by 8 pm Pacific time  Incumbent Gov. Kate Brown (D-OR) has the clear edge against her primary challengers. As the Oregon Statesman points out, her competitors have raised no money and also have no experience in elected office. Instead, it will be about the share of the vote for Brown, who won a 2016 special election but whose popularity has declined in the past year.  That may give a Republican candidate a small opening in November \u2014 but it\u2019s still an uphill battle in deep-blue Oregon. Still, there are a few GOP candidates who are fighting it out for the nomination. State Rep. Knute Buehler, a moderate with legislative experience; former Navy pilot Greg Wooldridge, who describes himself as a \u201cpragmatic conservative;\u201d and entrepreneur Sam Carpenter, who is the Trump-like candidate.",

First and foremost, I want to say that this has nothing to do with the midterm elections because I was going to send an e-mail regardless of the outcome. However, I guess one could argue that, in the end, the midterms are an important measure of a president's overall success, though I wouldn't go so far as to call the results a referendum. Legislatively, I feel I've had a lot of success that I think history will judge quite favorably. I mean, pretty much every modern president has seen his party lose seats during a midterm, you know?\n\n\"Anyway,\" the e-mail continued.\n\nA 150-page printout confirms that while Obama's points are generally cogent in the first quarter of the message, the increasingly chaotic spacing, multiple spelling errors, and near total lack of commas rendered the later portions almost impossible to parse.\n\nExcerpts indicate an erratic use of capitalized and underlined words, with the phrase \"Stopped a second Great Depression\" mentioned 14 times in a bolded red font double the size of surrounding text. In addition, the e-mail contained multiple links to the Wikipedia entry for Social Security and line graphs of Ronald Reagan's year-by-year approval ratings.\n\nBecause Obama copied and pasted some critical passages directly from right-wing editorials and personal blogs, the e-mail included formatting irregularities that caused many citizens to receive a message in which all of the apostrophes were replaced with question marks. Moreover, some software flagged it as spam.\n\n\"I don?t mean to be rude, but I thought we were all on the samepage about helath care reform,\" the 29th paragraph of Obama's e-mail read in part. \"It was part of my platform. You all knew I was goingt o pursue it when you elected me. And just real fast, going back on what I said earlier, the economic stimulus cut taxes for 95% of Americans. It didn't raise them. It cut them. You people need to look at facts and stop litnening to all the right wing crap out there. By the way, we're basically out of Iraq now. You?re welcome.\"\n\n\"JESUS CHRIST, WE LOST OVER @ MILLION JOBS BEFOREE I EVEN TOOK OFFICE!!!11!\" reads a sentence occupying a large white space between two massive chunks of texts, one of which was a 6,500-word tangent on the Muslim community center being built two blocks from the former World Trade Center site.\n\nAccording to White House sources, Obama \"snapped\" late Tuesday afternoon when a staffer reminded him he was scheduled to take a call from incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner. At that point, a visibly disgusted Obama was observed slowly repeating the words \"House Speaker Boehner\" before ordering everyone to leave the Oval Office, where he sat typing and, according to some, banging angrily on his keyboard for the next five hours.\n\nWhen White House Chief of Staff Pete Rouse urged the president to sleep on the e-mail, Obama told him he had already sent it.\n\n\"In terms of fulfilling campaign promises I think I've actually done a pretty good job in terms of fulfilling campaign,\" Obama wrote in response to an anonymous comment made to a post by conservative blogger Michelle Malkin. \"I know I said I'd close Guantanamo and I sti5ill want to do that but it's harder than it looks. And yes I know I said it would be done by now along with energy reform too\u2014-trust me it is still a priority because \"TOGETHER WE CAN & MUST EMBRACE CLEAN ENERGY\"\"\n\n\"Yes we can!\" the e-mail concluded. \"Ugh, you know what? Forget it. Believe what you want. Yours, Barack.\"\n\nThus far the response from the American public has been subdued, though a sixth of the populace did not even receive the e-mail because the message generated 50 million mailer-daemon delivery failure notifications.\n\n\"I tried reading [Obama's] e-mail, but it was just way too long,\" said 48-year-old Sophia Washington of Moraine, OH, adding that because her computer displayed the text all on one line, she had to scroll from left to right in order to read it. \"I just ended up skimming to see if my name was in there. It wasn't, but I did notice that my daughter can stay on my insurance for one more year. That's great. I think that's because the Republicans won the midterms.\"",

                              "text": "Adapted from the latest Radio Derb, available exclusively on VDARE.com  If you followed the recent hysteria about our cruelty to illegal alien children on non-Main Stream Media, you'll be familiar with the depth of nonsense and dishonesty behind it all.  You'll know that the policy causing all the shrieking and fainting has been in place for years, long before Donald Trump showed up. You'll have seen the old clips from not-that-many years ago of Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and both of the Clintons telling us what a great evil illegal immigration is and how we need to take a strong stand against it.  You've probably also heard the numbers. You know that of the 12,000 minors detained in the six weeks of our zero-tolerance policy, only 2,000 were actually with a person claiming to be a parent. That's seventeen percent. You probably suspect, as I and Attorney General Sessions do, that if DNA testing were to be applied, that percentage would drop into low single figures.  You likely know that Mexico, through which these Central American invaders passed, has a well-equipped U.S. embassy and nine, count 'em nine, consulates scattered across that country from Yucatan in the south to Tijuana in the north. Any Central American seeking asylum in the U.S.A. could apply at any of those places, without any fear of being separated from his children.  You probably also know that Mexico is a nation addled with criminality and corruption. Much of what happens there is dictated by crime syndicates who depend on smuggling narcotics into the U.S.A. Those syndicates obviously have a keen interest in keeping our Border Patrol busy with other matters\u2014like, for example, detaining and processing illegal border-crossers.  As of last Friday, you're probably acquainted with the backstory behind Time magazine's current cover picture of a weeping tot who, according to Time, had been ripped from her mother's arms.  The true story\u2014uncovered by the British press, of course, not by our own worthless hacks\u2014is that the child comes from a comfortable middle-class family in Honduras; that the child's mother long fantasized about living in the U.S.A.; and that she at last acted on her fantasy, paying six thousand dollars to people traffickers and heading north without telling her husband, who is left in Honduras with their other three children, aged fourteen to six.[ Honduran father reveals daughter was never separated from her mother, By Daniel Bates and Karen Ruiz , Daily Mail, June 23, 2018]  The husband tells us that to the best of his knowledge child and mother have not been separated \u2026 though child and father obviously have, by several hundred miles, at the mother's initiative.  This whole thing, this whole hysteria, is in other words bogus from top to bottom, just like all the other Progressive hysterias of recent years: Charlottesville, Russian election meddling, Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, the savage racism of asking for voter I.D. at polling stations.  If you pay any attention at all, if you care at all about actual facts, if you're willing to privilege\u2014pardon the word, please: it's the correct word\u2014if you're willing to privilege objective truth over your own surging emotions and personal resentments, you know that it's all one Big Lie.  It's a usual thing for people suspected of a crime to be detained by law enforcement. If they have kids, this perforce separates them from their kids, since no humane society wants kids placed in adult detention facilities.  That's been true in the case of U.S. citizens for ever. To say it should not pertain to non-citizens is to privilege\u2014again, that's the mot juste here\u2014to privilege foreigners over our own people. And foreigners have a straightforward way to avoid this particular peril: They can stay in their own countries.  \"But they're desperate!\" wail the hysterics. \"Their countries are so messed up! And it's OUR FAULT they're messed up!\"  The first thing to be said about that is, that a very great many countries are messed up. Billions\u2014that's \"billions\" with a \"b\"\u2014of people live in messed-up countries. A handful of outliers excepted, all countries are messed up except the few established and majority-populated by Ice People\u2014Europeans and East Asians.  Getting and keeping a not-messed-up country seems to be a difficult, an extraordinarily difficult achievement. Not even Ice People can always pull it off. For a non-messed-up country, iciness is necessary but not sufficient. Russia is quite badly messed up; so is China. Check out Albania. Check out North Korea. Being an Ice People country doesn't guarantee you're not messed up, nor vice versa, but that's the way to bet.  As for the notion of it being our fault that Central American countries are messed up, I don't buy it. For one thing, messed-up-ness is the normal state of affairs for countries not populated and run by Ice People, as just stated.  Take Latin America. It's hard not to notice that the general level of messed-upness down there is greatest where Ice People are least numerous. The southern \"cone\" countries\u2014Chile, Argentina, Uruguay\u2014with mostly Ice People populations, have their problems, no doubt; but none of them is Guatemala or El Salvador. They are the least messed-up Latin American countries.  How is that? Did we evil Gringos just forget to go and mess them up? Please.  I'm put in mind of the reply the Mexican made to the Texan when Tex asked why Mexicans are always so mad at the U.S.A. and blame us for everything. The Mexican's reply, according to P.J. O'Rourke: \"You stole half our country. And not only that, Se\u00f1or, you stole the half with all the paved roads.\"  And then, if your country messed up my country, why would I spend my family's savings and risk life and limb to break into your country, the great messer-upper?  One of the blessings of living in Central America is that if you are dissatisfied with your country, there are lots of countries close by you can flee to for refuge. A citizen of Honduras is closer to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Panama, Colombia, and the Bahamas than he is to the U.S.A., and not much further from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil.  Refuge-wise, he's spoiled for choice. Why would he want to come here, to the Great Satan, with all our cruelty and racism and xenophobia and white supremacy and toxic masculinity?  Mrs. Hernandez, the mother in the Time magazine cover story, doesn't seem at all mad about Uncle Sam messing up her country.  Listings of the Four Cardinal Virtues generally put prudence at number one.  In the realm of the National Question\u2014the question of what kind of nation we wish to be, and of what kind of nation we wish our children and grandchildren to inherit\u2014prudence is surely appropriate.  If getting and maintaining a non-messed-up country is as difficult at it seems to be, and as dependent as it seems to be on a healthy supermajority of Ice People, prudence consists in a strict attention to demographic stability and the avoidance of wild demographic experiments.  With all my heart, and with as loud a voice as I can raise, for the sake of my children and their children, I urge prudence upon our nation's leaders.  But what our nation's leaders are actually doing is \u2026 nothing much.  There are plain political reasons for this. Some of them, some of those reasons, have been the motivations behind this week's hysteria over illegal aliens. Others are more longstanding and baked-in to our system.  Our national legislature is quite finely balanced between the two big parties. The Senate is Republican by 51 percent; the House is Republican by 54 percent (55 percent if you factor in currently vacant seats). Under these circumstances, with midterm elections just twenty weeks away, both parties are of course strategizing like crazy.  The Democrats' strategy is to run out the clock: doing nothing either positive or negative while striving to make President Trump look as bad as possible in the eyes of their base\u2014GoodWhite ethnomasochists and racial minorities. The Main Stream Media are totally on board with this, and pushing the strategy for all they're worth.  That's what this week's hysteria has been about. Random comment from a random media shill, this one actually Charles Blow [Email him] at the New York Times June 17th:  Trump is lying, as he often does. This barbaric policy is an outgrowth of his own personal cruelty \u2026 This practice of family separation must end, and Trump and every other politician who was silent about it or worse, endorsed it, must be held to account at the ballot box.[Trump and the Baby Snatchers]  That puts it as plainly as you could want. Trump is an evil person! Vote Democrat!  Godwin's Law\u2014which states, just to remind you, that as an internet discussion thread grows longer, the probability of someone mentioning Hitler approaches certainty\u2014has been much in evidence in this week's hysteria: so much so, in fact, that even some of the Open-Borders people have felt moved to protest.  Here for example was John Podhoretz, an old-school Jewish immigration sentimentalist and race denialist:  Hitler wanted all Jews dead. Trump wants non-Americans who are here in violation of US law out of the United States. Dislike that all you wish. I do. I do not think this is the right policy. But it's not the systematic elimination of the Other. Stop cheapening the Holocaust to score political points, June 22, 2018  Which might be a bit more persuasive if Podhoretz had not himself done a bit of Holocaust-cheapening five months ago when he compared either Presidential advisor Stephen Miller or our own Steve Sailer\u2014it's not clear which\u2014to Joseph Goebbels.  Still, it's a sign of how crazy things have gotten that even Podhoretz, a neocon's neocon, thinks the Godwinization of our public discourse has gone too far.  That's congressional Democrats and their MSM shills. What about congressional Republicans?  Well, there have been signs of sentient life in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Goodlatte Bill was voted down on Thursday, but it got 193 GOP votes, that's 82 percent of the House Republicans who voted\u2014much better than forecast. Praise and blessings from Radio Derb to all 193 of those House Republicans; a pox on the 41 Republican Nays (except those who, like Rep. Steve King, were voting against the Amnesty provision that the bill was trying to trade for patriotic reforms).  Speaker Paul Ryan himself did not vote. This is customary and not at all remarkable.  Ryan does, however, seem to have taken that better-than-expected 193 vote count to heart. He's been working up a bill of his own, a much cuckier, more donor-friendly bill. He'd planned to bring his bill to a vote this week right after Goodlatte's, but that vote has now been postponed to next week so that Ryan can jiggle the bill a bit to make it more acceptable to the 193. [House Rejects Hard-Line Immigration Bill and Delays Vote on Compromise, By Thomas Kaplan and Nicholas Fandos, The New York Times, June 21, 2018]  There is very little prospect that Ryan's jiggling will make this second bill anything other than what it currently seems to be: a huge mass Amnesty for alien scofflaws garnished with some vague, easily-reversed promises on border security and internal enforcement. That's what GOP donors want, and that's what Ryan will give them. After all, six months from now he'll be working for them openly, full-time, as a lobbyist.  The Senate is as usual immigration-shy and effectively inert. Even if Ryan's bill passes the House, it will die in the Senate. Everybody, including Paul Ryan, knows this.  So it's all kabuki theater. Democrats want to go into the midterms saying to their base that the President is Hitler; Republicans want to go in saying to their base that, heck, we know you want something done and we tried to do something, we really did, but there are just too many darn Democrats in Congress to get anything through.  The actual mood of the Republican base seems to be strongly pro-enforcement, even after this MSM blizzard of stories about howling toddlers being ripped from their mothers' arms. The strong vote for the Goodlatte Bill reflects this: GOP congresscritters have been hearing from their constituents.  My own thumbnail gauge of GOP voter sentiment is, as I mentioned last week, the Letters columns of the New York Post, which I have reason to believe actually reflect the feelings of readers of this conventionally center-right newspaper in a not-very-Republican region.  The Post actually ran an editorial about border detentions as the hysteria got under way, taking quite a stern line against President Trump's policy. [Stop breaking up families at the border, June 17, 2018] I waited patiently to see what the Letters column showed.  That editorial ran on Sunday, June 17. Monday, June 18, nothing. Tuesday, June 19, seven letters. Five of the seven were hysterical. The words \"ripping,\" \"ripping,\" \"kidnapping,\" and \"ripped\" showed up in four of the five. Godwin's law of course kicked in, quote from a Manhattan letter-writer: \"I now feel like I'm living in Nazi Germany,\" That's from the heart of New York City, current mayor Comrade Bill \"Honeymoon in Castro's Cuba\" de Blasio.  Even then, though\u2014on Tuesday, as the hysteria was cresting\u2014two of the Post's seven reader letters were non-hysterical. One blamed the illegals for putting their children at risk. Another calmly suggested using FEMA facilities\u2014Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2014to house the detainees.  Friday the Post ran another batch of readers' letters, nine this time. Only one followed the hysterical line. Incredibly, it refrained from invoking Godwin's Law; but it did include the phrase, quote, \"ripped from their mothers' arms,\" The other eight wanted better border control and scoffed at the hysteria. Seven of the eight supported current policy. The eighth opposed it from the right, deploring, \"President Trump's executive order flip-flop,\u201d which the writer blamed on Ivanka and Melania.  I don't say this is definitive, certainly not any kind of scientific survey. Those letters do show, though, that even here in New York\u2014the beating heart of Left-liberal lunacy and Republican cuckery\u2014there are plenty of people not taken in by the hysteria.  I agree, by the way, with that eighth New York Post reader that Trump's Executive Order was a blunder. The policy that caused all the hysteria\u2014separating kids from their parents or pretend-parents and keeping them in HHS facilities for a few days\u2014was perfectly legal, defensible, and humane. What's supposed to happen now? We put the kids in Border Patrol lock-ups? How is that better?  The logic is inescapable. An adult who crosses the border without authorization is liable to arrest and detention, quite rightly so. If there are children with him, those children need to be detained and cared for, too; though since it's the adult who broke the law, not the child, this is a child-care issue, not a law-enforcement issue.  If child-care detention in HHS facilities is unacceptable, and detention of children in Border Patrol lockups with their parents is unthinkable, the only possibility is to let the kids go. So thousands of children\u2014including a lot of teenagers and likely some adults posing as teenagers \u2014with no proper claim to U.S. residence, have gotten it. And when the accompanying adult really is the child's parent, they'll get to stay too.[\u2018Unaccompanied Migrant CHILDREN\u2019 Arrive at NY Airport -Appear to be GROWN MEN With SCRUFFY BEARDS and Shaving Kits (VIDEO), Gateway Pundit, June 23, 2018]  Our courts will make sure of that. Our courts are in fact a big part of the problem. Michelle Malkin many years ago stated the Prime Directive of immigration jurisprudence: \"It ain't over until the alien wins.\" That will probably be the governing factor in the fate of these Central American border-jumpers going forward.  A friend who knows much more about our laws and Constitution than I do tells me that Congress could in fact bar the federal judiciary from considering these cases.  That's nice, supposing my friend is right and I've understood him correctly; but the chance of Congress actually doing anything that imaginative, or that patriotic, is so small you'd need an electron microscope to see it. So this idea is like\u2014to leap to the other end of the cosmic scale\u2014is like the Heat Death of the Universe: kind of interesting, but not actually relevant to anything likely to happen in our lives.  The President could anyway have spared himself all the wrangling his administration's in for with the judiciary, and could also have spared us this last few day's screeching hysteria, by just doing what he was elected to do: build an effective border barrier.  It's not that hard. Israel's done it; Hungary's done it; Saudi Arabia and India have done it. China did it two thousand years ago.  What, you want to tell me we can't do it until Congress appropriates the funds? I don't believe it. I understand about checks and balances, but the President doesn't have that little power. If we can bomb wedding parties in Afghanistan without a Congressional declaration of war, surely we can put up a decent border barrier.  This has been Trump's greatest failure. Those of who voted for him, campaigned for him, and turned out on freezing winter mornings to show our support for him, need to keep telling him this.  Build the damn wall, Mr. President!

                              "text": "From Trump\u2019s bad week to watching the Democrats freak \u2014 and most points in between \u2014 it\u2019s time for a look back at the week that was. Personal Liberty Digest\u00ae presents: The WIRE!  President Donald Trump suffered through what may have been his worst week in the White House when his former minions Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort both hit the wall over tax and financial crimes. Of course, liberals immediately began shrieking about impeachment, as if being a pig who associates with other pigs is an impeachable offense.    \u201cImpeachable? Sure. Convictable? We sure hope not.\u201d  Cohen arranged a hush money payment he didn\u2019t make. Manafort got popped for crimes he committed while Mueller was director of the FBI and Obama was president. How is this going to end the Trump presidency, exactly?    Details are only important to MAGA rubes.  Trump crony David Pecker of tabloid publisher American Media International has reportedly received immunity in return for information he provided to investigators looking into the Michael Cohen case.    How is anyone surprised that a story involving porn stars and playmates also involved a Pecker?  With Manafort and Cohen going down, and Pecker getting immunity, President Trump \u2014 as usual \u2014 took to Twitter to vent his frustration over \u201cflipping,\u201d which he called \u201cunfair.\u201d    Little snitches get bigly stitches.  While liberals cheered the Cohen and Manafort cases as \u201cproof\u201d that Trump is dirty, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that two years of special counseling, and still no Russian collusion, just Trump acting like Bill Clinton. In the interest of fairness, Trump should have to marry Hillary.    He would resign tomorrow.  Even if they manage to impeach Trump, getting 2/3 of the Senate to vote to convict is more of an uphill battle than getting Nana Hilldawg elected. And even if that works out, guess what happens next? Say hello to President Pence.    Didn\u2019t think this one all the way through, did ya, Dems?  Speaking of illegal campaign contributions, given her campaign\u2019s unprecedented violations of campaign finance laws, it\u2019s a damned good thing for Nana Hilldawg that she lost.    It would be plain old weird if she wore her prison jumpsuit in the Oval Office.  Of course, no one seems to notice that paying hush money to a girlfriend may not be an illegal campaign contribution \u2014 or even illegal. But hey, good luck proving it.    Ought to be wrapping up that investigation by the time Ivanka is sworn in for her second term.  Anyone else notice that the \u201cresistance\u201d seems kinda overwrought about throwing Trump out of office? Almost like they still don\u2019t have someone to beat him in 2020.    There\u2019s always \u2014 never mind.  Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions got into it again this week with Trump complaining about Sessions\u2019 lack of control over the Department of Justice and Sessions proclaiming the DoJ wouldn\u2019t be improperly influenced.    One more public spat like this and they\u2019re not going to the prom together.  Liberals were quick to voice their outrage over the murder of Mollie Tibbetts by an illegal alien, whining about pro-border security people \u201cpoliticizing\u201d Tibbetts\u2019 murder. Right\u2026 because politicizing tragedy is wrong.    Up next on CNN: a town hall blaming the NRA for Parkland.  When Senator Elizabeth Warren sees the murder of Mollie Tibbetts, she sees what she calls \u201cthe REAL problem\u201d: so-called \u201cfamily separations\u201d at the U.S. border with Mexico.    Sorry Mollie, Lieawatha says you\u2019re \u201cfake news.\u201d  Liberals ratcheted up the outrage when an illegal alien was grabbed by ICE while taking his wife to the hospital for a c-section. None seemed interested in why ICE arrested the guy who was wanted for skipping out on a warrant for murder.    As we learned from their Tibbetts reactions, illegal aliens\u2019 comfort > human life.  The \u201cresistance\u201d cheered as multiple Democrat Senators have refused to meet with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as if refusing to meet with a guy they already promised to no-vote is brave or noteworthy.    It\u2019s gonna be super awkward when Justice Kavanaugh sits down in front of them at the next State of the Union.  It\u2019s worth noting that the Democrats wouldn\u2019t be throwing such an impotent tantrum if they hadn\u2019t rigged the nomination process themselves.    That high horse looks an awful lot like a petard.  Nana ain\u2019t going away quietly. The 2016 loser announced that she\u2019ll be headlining Democrat fundraisers in Chicago, New York and San Francisco this fall. (But probably not Wisconsin.)    With polls uncertain, Hillary will do her part to boost Republican fortunes in time for midterms.  Hillary isn\u2019t the only Clinton planning to \u201chelp\u201d the Democrats. Chelsea Clinton is saying she\u2019s considering a run for office. Democrats have Clintons like locker rooms have shower mold.    Chelsea 2032: Hey! What\u2019s That Smell?  Disgraced former intelligence analyst Reality Winner was sentenced this week to five years in prison for stealing classified information and mailing it to a media outlet; which serves to remind us all: If you\u2019re gonna leak classified intel, do it from the server in your bathroom.    It makes a big difference.  Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has had enough of the Trump show, whining about Republican refusal to betray the president and claiming the GOP mantra should be \u201cput your head in the sand.\u201d    It\u2019s catchy, but I like the Democrats\u2019 mantra better: \u201cLose.\u201d  And that\u2019s your week in review! For the Personal Liberty Digest\u00ae, I\u2019m Ben Crystal saying, \u201cSee you next week, on The WIRE!\u201d",

                              "text": "In recent years, it has become apparent that the Republican establishment is nearly as rife with the corruption of personal avarice and progressive ideology as the Democratic establishment, if not just as much so. Much of this came to light during the Obama administration, and I was never hesitant to point that out in this space when such evidence came to my attention.  In our quest to drain the Washington swamp and systematically uncovering \u201cswamp monsters\u201d in the course of doing so, it is important that we play no favorites, regardless of what an individual\u2019s station or perceived value might be.  It is well-known amongst informed conservatives and libertarians that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pretty much the poster boy for this sort of corruption. While many of us find his two-faced pretending to conservatism whilst advancing liberal policies odious, as long as he holds his position, we do in fact have to deal with him.  take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? * Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker  Email *  Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

Despite the fact that President Donald Trump and a few stalwart Republican lawmakers in Congress have been obliged to (at least) attempt to gain McConnell\u2019s cooperation on matters of legislative process, if we are to effectively commence the aforementioned swamp draining, we cannot overlook McConnell\u2019s duplicity, nor his Beltway-bred avarice.  To this end, I will speak to the recent story in Breitbart News that detailed the fact McConnell\u2019s in-laws \u2013 the family of his wife, Elaine Chao \u2013 have purchased 10 transoceanic cargo ships from the Chinese government since Chao became transportation secretary. This was first revealed in the New York Times best-seller \u201cSecret Empires \u201d by Peter Schweizer , but the Chao family\u2019s shady dealings and ties to the Chinese government have been known amongst some of us for quite a bit longer.  As reported a few weeks ago, Schweizer\u2019s book also addressed the billion-dollar dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, with the Chinese government, and which may include significant national security concerns for the United States.  While McConnell is an elected official whom we can\u2019t do much about until his constituents tire of him, his wife \u2013 who resembles the hardened brothel owner from the film \u201cBig Trouble in Little China\u201d \u2013 was nominated to her post by Donald Trump in 2016 and confirmed by the Senate in 2017.  You see, this is where the faith of some in Donald Trump as a dedicated swamp-drainer tends to falter. Yes, it is true that Chao has all of the requisite stellar Beltway credentials to serve as secretary of transportation, but those are precisely the sort of credentials that American voters did not want in their president when they elected Trump.  What advantages or lagniappes might the Chao family enjoy given that one of their own just happens to be the U.S. transportation secretary and wife of the Senate majority leader? In the current political climate, we may never know.  During Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, there was the \u201cChinagate\u201d fundraising scandal, which plagued the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign and involved the transfer of America\u2019s most sensitive technology to the Communist Chinese. When Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state during the Obama administration, the decades-long, far-too-cozy ties between the Clintons, Obama and the Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 whose stated goal is to supplant our system of governance with an Islamic one \u2013 came to light.  Lest I be accused of singling out Democrats, I was far less than comfortable with Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, George P. Schultz, serving on the board of Bechtel Group Inc. during that administration. Bechtel is the largest construction contractor in the U.S. but has had far-too-cozy ties to evil regimes, among them the Saudis and Iraq under the late Saddam Hussein. My belief was that Reagan should have demanded Schultz either resign from Bechtel\u2019s board, or resign from his Cabinet post.  So, was Donald Trump unaware that his pick for transportation secretary was a swamp monster with ties to the Communist Chinese? It hardly seems likely, as familiar as Trump is with that nation. Was he unaware that the Chao family came under scrutiny in 2014 after Colombian authorities found 90 pounds of cocaine aboard one of their cargo vessels bound for the Netherlands?  While it is possible that no one in the Chao family had any knowledge whatsoever of the cocaine sequestered aboard their ship, the fact that the stash had a street value of over $30 million does tend to give one pause. That\u2019s a nice chunk of change to have a piece of, even if one is already a billionaire shipping magnate.  It is apathy and the blind trust we placed in those who govern us that brought us to a place of crisis sufficient to take a chance on someone wholly outside the Washington Beltway as president. Considering this, we cannot continue to summarily accept the status quo on the one hand whilst advocating efforts to dismantle it with the other.  Nor can we tolerate the corrupt and nepotistic behavior of those in our government because they happen to be registered Republicans. If our president insists upon enlisting the dubious services of swamp operatives \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 it is up to voters to call him out on it, because no one else will.

                              "text": "The Washington Times\u2019 Charles Hurt appeared on the Tucker Carlson show Wednesday night to discuss how recent events are \"playing right into the hands of Donald Trump.\" He cites the success of radical leftist candidates in recent Democratic primaries and, in particular, the race that everyone is talking about, 28-year-old Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s surprise win over ten-term Congressman Joseph Crowley in New York District 14. It was once thought that Crowley, referred to as the \u201cKing of Queens,\u201d might even become the next Speaker of the House if Democrats regain the House majority in November. Instead, as Trump said, \u201cHe got his a** kicked.\u201d The Democrat's lurch to the left, Hurt believes, will not play out well in the general election.  He compares it to the Tea Party candidates who prevailed in the 2010 Republican primaries, but were too far to the right to win in a general election. An example would be Tea Party Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell's defeat of the more moderate Delaware Congressman Michael Castle in the primary. She lost the general election because she was far too conservative for the state. Prior to the primary, Castle, who had served two terms as governor and nine terms in the House, was considered a shoo-in to beat the Democrat, Chris Coons.  Similar scenarios played out all over the country in the 2010 mid-terms. At one point, it appeared likely that Harry Reid would lose his Senate seat to Tea Party candidate Sharron Angle in Nevada. Instead, he won the race. It was thought that a more moderate, more seasoned candidate could have derailed him.  take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Completing this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.  Throughout the recent New York District 14 primary, Ocasio-Cortez \u201cattacked Crowley for his race saying that, as a white man, he was not fit to represent the district. She explicitly said this election is about race.\u201d  Carlson and Hurt wondered how a candidate could get away with saying that \u201cthe election is about the color of a person\u2019s skin.\u201d  Ocasio-Cortez also ran on abolishing ICE and impeaching Trump. Those may be winning issues in NY 14, but a tough sell elsewhere.  Hurt : Increasingly, it (discussing race) is something that is accepted coming from the left\u2026Ever since the beginning of the whole Tea Party movement, we\u2019ve been waiting for a similar reckoning to hit the Democratic party. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now\u2026These people are communists and that\u2019s a real problem. Democrats are going to have to contend with this and this is not going to be the last sitting Democrat who is going to get ousted by some socialist, who wants free stuff for everybody, who comes out of nowhere.  Tucker : This candidate in Queens ran explicitly against ICE and called for a South African style Truth and Reconciliation Commission to go through the sins of ICE, the human rights abuses. Are you going to see other Democrats run on that same platform?  Hurt : We\u2019re going to see actual mainstream Democrats in Congress pushing this lie about ICE. And, my goodness, what do you expect when they accuse ICE agents and border patrol agents of being like Nazis.  Asked by Carlson if a candidate can win on this platform, Hurt said:  Hurt : Maybe in NY 14, you can win on that platform, but I guarantee you, anywhere else across the country, you\u2019re not going to be able to win on this and all of this plays right into the hands of Donald Trump.  I would argue that Donald Trump got himself reelected this week and it\u2019s because of crazy stuff like this and the Maxine Waters stuff and the haranguing people in public. It\u2019s all playing into Trumps hands.\u201d  The interview clip appears in the following video.  Conservative commentator Michele Malkin questions not only the patriotism of the \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d movement, but also their sanity. Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America party. These are \u201cshrieking radicals that oppose any immigration enforcement.\u201d  She points out that approximately 20 Democratic candidates are running on the Abolish ICE platform, including several sitting Congressmen. There are many others, who aren\u2019t calling for outright abolishment of ICE, but who insist on major changes in immigration law. ICE field offices across the country are under siege and some have been forced to shut down, such as the Portland, OR facility I reported on here, due to protestors. Yet, no party leaders are condemning their actions.  President Trump is now trying to make Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, two of the least popular members of Congress, the faces of the Democratic party, which is a very effective strategy.  The more Trump achieves, the more \u201cunhinged\u201d their rhetoric becomes. In fact, The Republican National Committee has just released one of their best ads ever, based on this theme. Inside of one minute and seven seconds, it provides voters with ten reasons why they should not cast their ballot for a Democrat in November.  \u201cThe Left in 2018: Unhinged\u201d  I agree with Charles Hurt. It\u2019s been a very good week for Donald Trump.",

I was depicted as an arrogant, obnoxious, ruthless British villain. There was just one problem, as I pointed out to Trump in a boardroom exchange that tragically never got aired. \u2018One of us,\u2019 I explained, \u2018is a violent alcoholic who\u2019s been shot by an ex-wife, stabbed in bar-room knife fights, and has a criminal record for a DUI.\u2019 I competed in Donald Trump\u2019s first season of Celebrity Apprentice \u2013 and I was once portrayed as evil, not unlike how Donald has been branded these days Yesterday, Hillary Clinton showed she didn\u2019t get the \u2018rise above the monster\u2019 memo, shrieking herself hoarse (pictured today speaking in North Carolina) I paused for effect. \u2018The other\u2026. is me\u2026. the bad guy.\u2019 Trump roared with laughter. He got the irony, even if viewers never got the chance to. I was reminded of this today as I watched President Obama tear into Trump, branding him a small-brained, star-f***ing, Ku Klux Klan tolerating \u2018loser\u2019 born with a silver spoon in his mouth. It was an astonishingly personal and nasty attack from a man whose own wife Michelle recently declared from atop her lofty moral plinth: \u2018When they go low, we go high.\u2019 Yesterday, Hillary Clinton showed she didn\u2019t get the \u2018rise above the monster\u2019 memo either, shrieking herself hoarse as she once again laid into Trump supporters she recently described as \u2018The Deplorables\u2019. \u2018I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and the anger of people who support Donald Trump,\u2019 she raged. This follows a familiar pattern from Team Clinton as election day draws closer: when in doubt, trash Trump and his followers in the meanest, ugliest, most personal way possible. The mantra seems to be: \u2018When they go low, we plummet even lower.\u2019 A similar mistake was made in Britain during the EU referendum debate when the Remain campaigners belittled and berated the Brexiters in a snide, sneering, superior manner. They lost. The problem for Mrs Clinton as she gallops across the fields of America like a crusading white knight trying to single-handedly save the nation from imminent Armageddon at the hands of Mr Evil is that she\u2019s the Trace Adkins of this battle. In other words, she ain\u2019t no saint herself. Her supporters don\u2019t accept this of course. To them, Hillary is a vestal political virgin of unimpeachable integrity. \u2018Why would I want to criticise her?\u2019 a female Clinton-ite actress indignantly asked me on Twitter yesterday. \u2018She\u2019s up against a mad man. Compared to him, she\u2019s bathed in golden light.\u2019 It was the kind of thing I\u2019d expect Tom Cruise to say in defence of his beloved basket case Scientologists. Yet as I write this, Clinton is facing potential FBI criminal investigations on two fronts. One is the re-opened case of her ongoing email scandal, this time centering on the contents of sexting pervert Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. The second, according to the Washington Post, is an investigation into an alleged \u2018pay-or-play\u2019 operation Hillary ran out of the State Department that favoured donors to the Clinton Foundation charity. At the root of it lies a central charge that the Clintons have cynically and greedily exploited political power and status to enrich themselves, under the convenient protective umbrella of their Foundation. Big sponsors have been repeatedly \u2018invited\u2019 to donate big sums to the Foundation, then also donate big sums to the personal fortunes of Bill or Hillary in the form of cash, holidays, private jets and other benefits. On the face of it, this seems like a prima facie case of potential corruption. Yet the Post further reports the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation has been held up by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, to the fury of many in the FBI. This is the same Loretta Lynch who Bill Clinton hijacked for a 30-minute conversation on a private airstrip days before the original FBI email investigation verdict exonerating his wife was made public. We can all draw our own conclusions, none of them I suspect very pretty. I know from first-hand experience there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch with the Clintons. There is no such thing as a free lunch with the Clintons. I know from my own dealings it\u2019s quid-pro-quo: Bill would scratch my back if I scratched his I\u2019ve interviewed Bill Clinton twice, for CNN. On both occasions, the request was only granted once I had agreed to moderate a panel for the former president at his annual Clinton Global Initiative event in aid of Clinton Foundation. It was a strict quid-pro-quo: Bill would scratch my back if I scratched his. So I scratched away, as do many other TV journalists each year who want an interview with him. There\u2019s a similar pattern to almost everything in Planet Clinton: they trade favours. But when that trade involves millions of dollars raked into personal bank accounts on the back of charity donations, it stinks to high heaven. \u2018Trace\u2019 Clinton should get off her high horse, before she gets a nosebleed. \nH/T \u2013 DailyMail \nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.

                              "text": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s health has been the subject of\u00a0intense speculation during the 2016 presidential campaign, in part because the candidates\u2019 fitness to serve is of valid concern to voters, and in part because it was seized upon by her opponents\u00a0as a way to undermine her candidacy. While\u00a0presidential candidates aren\u2019t required by law to release information about their medical histories,\u00a0it has become routine for them to do so, and both Democratic candidate Clinton and Republican candidate Trump have provided physician\u2019s statements attesting to their good health. Despite this, rumors\u00a0to the effect that Clinton is suffering from\u00a0some kind of serious, undisclosed\u00a0medical condition continue to run rampant. The statement released by Clinton\u2019s\u00a0personal doctor, Lisa Bardack, MD of Mount Kisco, New York, lists past bouts of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots), an elbow fracture, and a concussion, plus\u00a0ongoing conditions of hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies. Though her family medical history includes heart disease and stroke, a cardiac screening was conducted in 2015 and came back negative. So did a cancer screening. \u201c[Clinton] is in excellent physical condition,\u201d Bardack concluded, \u201cand fit to serve as President of the United States.\u201d We note that Dr. Bardack\u2019s assessment (which she reaffirmed in writing in August 2016) was based on an actual physical examination of the candidate\u00a0\u2014 not a minor consideration, given that much of the speculation about Clinton\u2019s health has been fueled by \u201cdiagnoses\u201d from afar by physicians who have never shaken her\u00a0hand, much less conducted a thorough examination of her. Media personality \u201cDr. Drew\u201d Pinsky, for\u00a0one, delivered a rambling assessment of Clinton\u2019s health\u00a0on a radio talk show in which he repeatedly claimed\u00a0he had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about her medical fitness \u2014\u00a0based on nothing more than having read\u00a0Dr. Bardack\u2019s two-page statement. He was roundly criticized by other medical professionals for doing so. While Pinsky\u2019s speculation was that Clinton suffers from\u00a0brain damage, a\u00a0later\u00a0entrant in the armchair\u00a0diagnosis field, Dr. Ted Noel of Orlando, Florida, claimed\u00a0he could\u00a0prove\u00a0via cherry-picked news articles, photos, and video clips of the candidate that she likely suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease. Noel\u2019s 16-minute video, titled \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s Illness Revealed,\u201d starts with this disclaimer: I am a medical doctor with 36 years of experience, but I am not Hillary Clinton\u2019s treating physician, so I can\u2019t claim that what I\u2019m about to tell you is a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, at the end of\u00a0a litany\u00a0of hearsay, conjecture, and conspiracy theories Noel\u00a0states, flat out: \u201cHillary Clinton has advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201d We\u2019ll examine\u00a0some of his evidence and arguments momentarily, but first, here\u2019s what we know about Dr. Ted Noel himself: \u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s incapable of recognizing symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, but consider this:\u00a0If your primary care doctor suspected you had Parkinson\u2019s and wished to refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis, it would be to a neurologist, not an anesthesiologist. How accurate and reliable can such a medical diagnosis be? As we noted in the case of Dr. Drew Pinsky above, most medical professionals consider this inappropriate behavior on the part of a physician, if not downright unethical. Would you accept a diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease on the basis of a few minutes of video watched by a doctor you\u2019ve never met? In fact, Noel\u2019s assessment is nakedly partisan in intent, despite this feigned\u00a0disavowal that he makes toward the end of the video: Let us not confuse medical and political issues here. I\u2019m firmly opposed to Hillary Clinton on political and moral grounds, but this discussion has been about her medical condition. That\u2019s\u00a0after\u00a0Noel has described Clinton as \u201ca politician who lies about everything,\u201d and after he has made this statement about her\u00a0\u201cmedical\u201d condition: Our president must always be strong and clear-headed. If she is not doing the job, then who will? Will it be Huma Abedin, who has been associated with Muslim causes and directly involved in the Clinton Foundation corruption? Will it be Bill Clinton, who is at the center of the Clinton Foundation corruption? \u2026 Or will Vice President Tim Kaine take over? Of course, then the Clintons would lose their juice. What is the above, if not precisely \u201cconfusing medical and political issues\u201d? We\u2019re not just throwing that out\u00a0as a dismissive epithet; we mean\u00a0he is a conspiracy theorist. The\u00a0fundamental premise of this video is that Hillary Clinton and everyone around her\u00a0\u2014 her doctor, her family and friends, the\u00a0inner circle of her campaign, and the Democratic National Committee\u00a0\u2014 know full well that she (supposedly) has an incapacitating disease and are willfully concealing that fact from the public to gain power. Let\u2019s move on to consider the \u201cevidence\u201d Dr. Ted Noel uses to support his claim that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson\u2019s disease. According to a conspiracy web site, an unnamed Secret Service whistleblower revealed that\u00a0Clinton has\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s. Note well, however, Noel is here citing a secondhand report from a single, unnamed source published on the Alex Jones web site Infowars.com, which at one time or another has pushed every conspiracy theory known to humankind, from\u00a0allegations that President George W. Bush authorized the 9/11 attacks (which, by the way, weren\u2019t really\u00a0\u201cattacks\u201d according to this site, but rather \u201ccontrolled demolitions\u201c) to the claim that\u00a0President Barack Obama forged his own\u00a0birth certificate. Noel says\u00a0WikiLeaks released U.S. State Department e-mails which show that Clinton asked aides to research new Parkinson\u2019s disease drugs. Not true. Among the messages WikiLeaks released was\u00a0one e-mail received by Clinton that contained information about Provigil, a prescription drug described in that message\u00a0as follows: Provigil is used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder (sleepiness during scheduled waking hours among people who work at night or on rotating shifts). It is also often prescribed to treat excessive sleepiness in patients with Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, it has also gained a following among students, truckers, and others who want to stay awake for extended periods of time. In simpler terms, Provigil is used to treat\u00a0excessive sleepiness. Sometimes\u00a0that excessive sleepiness is in Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Other times it\u2019s\u00a0in people suffering from sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or shift work sleep disorder. Is\u00a0it accurate to describe Provigil as \u201ca new Parkinson\u2019s disease drug\u201d? No. Are there\u00a0Wikileaks e-mails indicating that Clinton specifically asked staffers to research Parkinson\u2019s drugs? No (check\u00a0for yourself). Noel attempts to link three separate incidents over a period of years in which Clinton fainted and/or fell, implying that the stated explanations for each\u00a0hid the \u201creal\u201d cause, Parkinson\u2019s disease. 31 January 2005: Clinton said she was feeling \u201cqueasy\u201d as she began a speech in upstate New York and later fainted at the podium. Secret Service agents broke her fall, so she was unhurt. \u201cOddly, she did not seek medical attention,\u201d Noel claims, but,\u00a0even more oddly,\u00a0an image of a\u00a0CNN article reporting that she did\u00a0receive medical attention at scene from a doctor in the audience\u00a0flashes on screen at the exact moment he says it. The physician,\u00a0Dr. Stephanie Pincus, said Clinton had been suffering from a GI virus for at least a day, and needed fluids and a rest. Nothing mysterious. 17 June 2009: Clinton fell and broke her elbow on her way from the elevator to her car in\u00a0the basement of\u00a0the State Department. Noel again uses the word \u201codd\u201d to describe the incident, wondering why Secret Service agents weren\u2019t able to break her fall, as they had done in the previous incident. \u201cShe would have to fall at a distance from them with no warning,\u201d he opines. And, indeed, according to news reports, she slipped and fell\u00a0\u2014 obviously without warning. Nothing mysterious. 17 December 2012: Clinton fainted in her home due to dehydration and struck her head, causing a concussion. \u201cBut again, this is very odd,\u201d Noel says. \u201cTo strike your head requires a complete loss of protective reflexes.\u201d Which, not very oddly at all, is precisely what occurs when you faint and lose consciousness. \u201cBeing wobbly from dehydration won\u2019t do this,\u201d he argues. But no one is talking about \u201cbeing wobbly.\u201d Clinton fainted; she lost consciousness, fell, and hit her head. And dehydration is frequently cited as a cause of fainting. Nothing mysterious. Why does Noel try so hard to make it seem there was something inexplicable about each of these incidents? Here\u2019s why: \u201cIf Hillary has Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d Noel says, \u201call three falls make sense\u201d\u00a0\u2014 as if they\u2019re impossible to make sense of without the Parkinson\u2019s explanation. But, as we\u2019ve just shown, that is not the case. \u201cEarly in 2016,\u201d Noel continues, \u201cHillary\u2019s problems started to be really obvious. Videos of odd physical movements and brain freezes became common. This is consistent with the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease into its later and more troublesome stages. \u201cThe first picture to surface is Hillary being helped up a set of porch steps in February. Once again, if she froze while climbing the steps, the people right next to her could catch her and keep her from injury.\u201d  But there\u2019s no reason to suppose that she\u00a0\u201cfroze.\u201d The original caption on this Getty Images photo, dated\u00a024 February 2016,\u00a0says she slipped while going up the stairs. Noel then directs our attention to\u00a0a video clip in which Clinton is seen nodding repetitively as other people speak:  \u201cTo most people, that was just odd,\u201d says Noel, once again employing his favorite adjective. \u201cBut if we think about Parkinson\u2019s disease, it\u2019s obvious. This is a head nodding tremor.\u201d No, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a tic Hillary Clinton has had for a long time, since at least the early \u201990s, usually in evidence when she\u2019s listening to another public speaker. Here\u2019s an example from 1993:  \u00a0 Noel next shows a video of a Clinton campaign rally on 2 April 2016, in which he claims she uses certain \u201ctechniques to hide tremors in her hands.\u201d The first is placing her hand flat on her chest, and the second is a gesture in which her fingers come together to form a sort of point \u2014 both of which he claims she does to prevent the audience from noticing tremors. But, in fact, if you watch more of the video than the few seconds Noel shows us, and with the audio turned on, you see that she\u2019s clearly using these gestures to emphasize verbal statements, and to suggest to the audience\u00a0that they\u2019re heartfelt. Plus, she transitions easily in and out of these hand gestures, never once displaying anything like a \u201ctremor\u201d when she\u2019s not using them. Noel next presents a series of images and clips, including\u00a0every conspiracy theorist\u2019s favorite Hillary Clinton video\u00a0\u2014 the same one that they have previously tried to pass off\u00a0as an \u201cepileptic seizure\u201d\u00a0\u2014 and claims, again, that the real explanation is Parkinson\u2019s. Here\u2019s the famous video:  This is\u00a0\u201canother Parkinson\u2019s disease problem,\u201d Noel claims, \u201cbut this time it\u2019s from the treatment, not the disease. It\u2019s an example of Parkinson\u2019s disease levadopa-induced dyskinesia, or PD LID.\u201d But no, it\u2019s not. As we reported previously, the journalists surrounding her at that moment saw nothing amiss or disturbing in her actions. Associated Press reporter Lisa Lerer described it as follows: As an Associated Press reporter who\u2019s spent more than a year covering her candidacy, I was there for her appearance. After she ordered herself a \u201ccold chai,\u201d my colleagues and I shouted some questions, mostly about Clinton\u2019s recent meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Perhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume, Clinton responded with an exaggerated motion, shaking her head vigorously for a few seconds. Video of the moment shows me holding out my recorder in front of her, laughing and stepping back in surprise. After the exchange, she took a few more photos, exited the shop and greeted supporters waiting outside.",

                              "text": "\u00a9 Alex Wong/Getty Images Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell hold a news briefing during the 2018 House & Senate Republican Member Conference on February 1, 2018 at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.  President Donald Trump is making a fresh -- if unexpected -- push for some gun law reforms following a tragic mass shooting last week in Florida, but it's not clear they will be embraced by Republican leaders on Capitol Hill nor rank-and-file conservatives who have long stood against diminishing gun rights.  House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have said little publicly since a former student massacred 17 people at a high school in Parkland about what Congress could do to address the epidemic of school shootings with legislation to reduce gun violence.  In the wake of these types of tragedies, both Republican leaders regularly tout their longstanding positions that enforcing existing gun laws and addressing mental health issues -- not imposing new limits to gun ownership -- should be the focus.  With the GOP majority in the House, and potentially even the Senate, at risk in November's midterm elections, any move by Ryan or McConnell to alienate pro-gun rights base voters -- who they need to be enthusiastic and show up in large numbers at the polls -- is politically tricky and not one they are ready to take.  In addition, the vast majority of GOP lawmakers, who are out of town for a week long recess, oppose most gun control measures and are not pressing their leaders for action.  Trump has repeatedly insisted in recent days he wants to \"get something done\" to address safety in schools.  \"Unlike for many years where people sitting in my position did not take action -- they didn't take proper action, they took no action at all -- we're going to take action,\" Trump said during a meeting with law enforcement officials at the White House, when the President also offered support for raising the legal age to purchase guns, getting rid of bump fire stocks, a controversial gun accessory that allows it to fire more rapidly, and focusing on mental health reforms.  But Trump's shifting positions on gun proposals make it difficult for congressional Republicans to know whether they would get any political cover with a base that continues to stand by core beliefs to protect the Second Amendment. Something the President says he backs today could easily be reversed in a new tweet tomorrow.  If Trump truly wants to have the GOP-led House and Senate pass these reforms, he will need to make a sustained push and be prepared to use his political capital to get it done over the objections of powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association.  RELATED: NRA chief accuses Democrats of pushing 'socialist' agenda in wake of Florida shooting  National polls show that a majority of Americans do support some targeted gun control measures, such as beefing up the background check system, but many GOP lawmakers say they are not feeling any pressure from voters in solidly red districts or states back home. One thing they do hear from their constituents, many of whom are single-issue voters, is that they will oppose those who change the laws.  Immediately following the shooting, Ryan argued it wasn't appropriate to wade into another divisive debate, but instead called for unity for those affected.  \"This is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings,\" he told reporters a day after the events unfolded at a press conference on Capitol Hill. \"We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together. This House, and the whole country, stands with the Parkland community.\"  Few House Republicans pressed for any legislative fixes. Moderate Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who is in one of the most competitive House districts, has pressed for a floor vote on his bipartisan bill to ban bump stocks, the tool that can be used to make a semi-automatic gun perform like an automatic weapon, and supports a bill to allow federal research on gun violence. Another House GOP member, Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York, called for hearings.  A day after the Parkland shooting, McConnell took to the Senate floor to condemn the vicious act, praise the heroism of first responders and send prayers to the victims. But he made no mention of a need for a legislative response -- one dealing with curbs on guns or other root causes of these crimes, such as mental health.  \"To say that such brutal, pointless violence is unconscionable is an understatement,\" the Kentucky Republican said. \"Schools should be places where children can learn, and faculty and staff can work, without fear of violence.\"  The top GOP senator is keenly aware there is not much appetite in his largely conservative conference for even the modest reforms Trump appears to be embracing, much less the sweeping gun law changes many Democrats champion.  Fiery comments from NRA chief Wayne LaPierre, at a conservative gathering outside Washington, illustrate why.  \"The elites don't care not one whip about America's school system and school children,\" LaPierre told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday. \"Their goal is to eliminate the second amendment and our firearms freedoms, so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.\"  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer responded.  \"The NRA is once again spewing pathetic, out of touch ideas, blaming everything but guns,\" the Democratic leaders said in a statement. \"The real test of President Trump and the Republican Congress is not words and empathy, but action. Will President Trump and the Republicans finally buck the NRA and get something done? Could this time be different?\"  Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a longtime opponent of gun control measures, publicly signaled he was revising his own positions at a CNN town hall on Wednesday night -- coming out in favor of banning gun sales to 18-year-olds who can now buy rifles, and potentially limiting the size of ammunition clips. One retiring lawmaker, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, announced he was working on a bill to up the age for those purchasing guns to 21, but there has been no rush from other Republicans to jump on board or call for votes.  RELATED: 6 things Marco Rubio said at the CNN town hall that made news in the US gun debate  Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, pointed to the legislation to fix the National Instant Background Check System, also called NICS, that the House approved in December, after another mass shooting in Texas exposed holes in the system that failed to flag a former service member to the database for his record of domestic violence. The bill passed narrowly because all except six House Democrats opposed the measure it was paired with, a bill to loosen gun restrictions to allow those with permits to carry concealed weapons to legally travel with those firearms to other states.  The unusual public profile of those high school students who survived the shooting and the increased public pressure had House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi point to their role as a \"tipping point\" in the debate over gun legislation.  \"They are doing a historic thing and I think they will make a big difference -- channeling their grief, their sorrow, their anger really, to save lives,\" Pelosi said, adding that \"all we are asking for is the speaker is to give us a vote. We believe here is bipartisan support for improving the background check bill.\"  But the response from top Hill Republicans leaders is similar to the ones they have had in recent mass shootings -- in Las Vegas, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in Orlando, Florida. Five years after the stunning murder of elementary school children and their teachers in Newtown, Connecticut, Congress returns to the same debate over and over.  The wide gulf in ideological views of the two parties has not changed, and the cautious response from GOP leaders continue to reflect that dynamic. The only force that might be able to change it is Trump himself. If the President decides to fully embrace the reforms he is touting, he might be able to get congressional Republicans to buy in.

                              "text": "This is a rush transcript from \"Special Report with Bret Baier,\" May 8, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When I make promises, I keep them. I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.  The fact is this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.  In the meantime, powerful sanctions will go into full effect. If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. Swift reaction. European allies releasing a statement together. \"It is with regret and concern that we, the leaders of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, take note of President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States of America from the JCPOA. Together we emphasize our continuing commitment to that agreement. This agreement remains important for our shared security. We urge the U.S. to ensure that the structures that the JCPOA can remain intact, and to taking action which obstructs it full implementation by all other parties to the deal,\" saying essentially they are negotiating further.  Not all countries sharing that. Saudi Arabia tweeting out, \"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia fully supports the measures taken by the president of the United States with regards to the JCPOA. We always had reservations with regards to sunset clauses, ballistic missiles program, and Iran's support for terrorism in the region.\" Similar statements coming from the UAE, Bahrain, the Gulf allies, and of course Israel.  Let's bring in our panel: Matt Schlapp, contributor with The Hill; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics and host of \"No Labels Radio\" on Sirius XM, and Eli Lake, columnist for Bloomberg View.  Eli, looking at looking at across the board the world reaction, your take on this and the hopes that, perhaps, you heard the secretary of treasury say there may be a renegotiation in the offing?  ELI LAKE, BLOOMBERG VIEW: There is also the period of 90 and180 days for the re-imposition of the sanctions. There are now negotiations that I guess have been announced between Iran and the European allies. And so far there has not been any kind of clear statements from the Iranians as to saying that they are going to begin enriching beyond the limits on uranium or building up their program, or kicking out inspectors.  All of that is pretty good. And I think in some ways it could be a continuation of the strategy that Trump has pursued really since the beginning of his presidency, which is to try to renegotiate a better deal.  But there is a paradox also in what he said today which is that he really made a very clear statement of solidarity with the Iranian people. And the question is, if Trump negotiates a bargain with the Iranian regime, where does that leave the Iranian people? I think now is a perfect opportunity for Trump to begin thinking about ways to support the democracy movement which has been gaining momentum really since late December in Iran.  BAIER: Right, exactly, those protests in December and January essentially about the weakening economy in Iran. Here is the president of Iran reacting to this announcement after President Trump spoke.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HASSAN ROUHANI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Tonight we witness an important historic experience. The same thing that we have said and repeated for 40 years has happened. Iran is a country that is loyal to its commitments, and the U.S. is a country that never sticks to its commitments.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  BAIER: Matt, your thought on that? And you hear it not only obviously from the Iranians but other opponents of this action, saying if the U.S. can't keep its international deals, how does any country believe that the U.S. can keep agreements?  MATT SCHLAPP, THE HILL: Right. And of course there is no future between an American bilateral relationship with the Mullahs in Iran. We have to look past the Mullahs in Iran to the future. And I agree with Eli completely. It's about the Iranian people who in many ways are aligned like no other country in the region to actually be in a position where they could be allied with us on several key issues. So it's about looking past the Mullahs. It's about weakening the Mullahs. Unfortunately we will never get the billions of dollars back that they got at the beginning of this arrangement with President Obama, but this does knock the second big pillar out of the Obama legacy. The Iran nuclear agreement is dead.  Now it can be negotiated, there are ways in which it transitions, but the fundamental premise of it is dead. And I'd have to say one other thing. When you have John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in there staffing the president to fulfill his promises, great things can happen.  BAIER: A.B., you hear some Democrats out there saying this was the wrong move because the next step is not set in stone yet. We don't know the way frankly. And they are comparing it to Obamacare and repeal and replace where there wasn't that next step. But here are some Democrats about this deal as it came to pass.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)  SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: We should not go forward with this agreement.  SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D-N.J.: The whole purpose of our negotiation was to ensure that there would be no pathway for Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability. And this deal doesn't achieve that.  REP. ELIOT ENGEL, D-N.Y.: I've said more times than I can count that I opposed the deal when it was announced. I voted against it on the House floor.  (END VIDEO CLIPS)  BAIER: Obviously, A.B., they are all saying different things now. What about this move today?  A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Bret, this was a flawed agreement from day one, and there were critics on both sides. That's perfectly clear. Right now there are senior members on Capitol Hill, House Armed Services Committee chairman, Republican senior members of the -- sorry, of the Foreign Affairs Committee, senior members of the House Armed Services Committee who are Republicans, very worried about the fact that you get out of this deal and you are left in a perilous place. Very difficult. It makes the challenge with North Korea much more difficult, and it creates a whole host of problems and consequences in the years to come.  It might have allowed for time for the kind of democracy-building and fighting for freedom that Eli Lake wrote so eloquently about today. It might have helped us keep our word with our allies, an area where we are really struggling because we actually don't have a new NAFTA deal. President Macron of France said getting out of this would be insane because there's really nothing left in its place.  I think that these next critical days and weeks are going to tell us whether or not he can actually keep Iran at the table, and whether our European allies can keep them from some kind of proliferation activity and keep them at the table. And if President Trump can end up renegotiating something, that will be a masterstroke. As of now we're just going to have to wait and see what they are willing to give.  BAIER: Part of this speech was to say, here's your opportunity, Iran. This deal was not working. You could still negotiation it. But Eli, very quickly, at the same time you have Secretary of State Pompeo on the ground in North Korea. Who knows, he could come home with three Americans as part of laying the groundwork for this, what is supposed to be a locked in meeting. Put the juxtaposition of those two things.  LAKE: I actually think what Trump did today could help in North Korea because it shows that he is willing to defy establishment, foreign policy Washington, and impose crippling sanctions over the objection of his closest allies and everything else.  I argued in columns that he should wait it out, and in some ways if the North Koreans are looking at that, I think they might say to themselves, we don't necessarily want to cross the sky. We are in good graces now. Imagine what happens if these negotiations don't work out. It could be perilous for us. That's one calculus. I think it's really hard to predict what Kim Jong-un will do. I don't think any intelligence agency really can get inside of his head. But I do think there could be this benefit of it which is that Trump is a disruptor, and he is willing to do things which other adversaries did not think was possible, and that could be a benefit in the context of North Korean negotiations.  BAIER: That's 100 percent true. Panel, thank you.  Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

                              "text": "Las Vegas, NV \u2014 For seven months, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has been caught lying, railroaded journalists, and done everything in their power to keep the facts on what happened on 1 October from ever reaching the public. The department\u2019s desire to keep the information secret was so overwhelming that they fought its release all the way to the Nevada Supreme Court. On Friday, the court rejected the police department\u2019s bid to keep the records secret and they are now forced to hand everything over.  On Wednesday, the department began releasing footage from the officers\u2019 body camera as they entered Stephen Paddock\u2019s suite in Mandalay Bay on the night of the shooting. Not surprisingly, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced on Tuesday that the first officer into the room that night, Levi Hancock, did not activate his camera.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how this footage will be played in the media, but I want to warn you, if you are a survivor or a family who lost a loved one, you should know the video from this concert is disturbing and graphic,\u201d he said.  take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the footage is just a slice of the many body camera clips and 911 calls the department has been ordered to release in response to a lawsuit brought by the Review-Journal and other media outlets.  \u201cWhat is seen on those videos in no way changes the facts that we were able to clarify for you shortly after the crime,\u201d Lombardo said at a Tuesday news conference, as he refused to answer any questions from reports.  Lombardo attempted to claim that his department didn\u2019t want to release the footage in an effort \u201cto protect the victims and their families of this incident,\u201d Lombardo said.  \u201cI want the community to know the release of the videos, 911 and documents will have a significant impact on the victims of this tragedy,\u201d he said.  However, the victims are the some of ones who are demanding the information be released as part of a massive lawsuit.  \u201cNow that it is facing having to follow the law and produce records, Metro is suggesting that the media is trying to victimize the community,\u201d Review-Journal attorney Maggie McLetchie said. \u201cThe truth is that the community still has many unanswered questions about the police response to 1 October, and it has a right to assess what happened for itself. The quest for transparency and accountability is about making sure we, as a community, do everything we can to uncover the truth and avoid future tragedies.\u201d  After shifting blame to the victims for not being transparent, Lombardo then claimed that they simply didn\u2019t have the manpower to release the records.  \u201cTransparency is not a burden for government agencies,\u201d Review-Journal Executive Editor Glenn Cook said, negating that claim. \u201cIt is a legal obligation that is essential to the preservation of the public\u2019s trust.\u201d  Indeed it is.  The video was released and the Associated Press issued the following statement:  Las Vegas police have released some officer body-camera video from the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Videos made public Wednesday are expected to show what two officers found entering a 32nd-floor hotel room where Stephen Paddock unleashed gunfire on a concert last October. Police say he killed 58 people and injured hundreds more before killing himself as authorities closed in. The footage represents a sample of hundreds of hours of body-camera recordings that police say don\u2019t answer why Paddock opened fire. The Associated Press and other media outlets sued to obtain videos, 911 recordings, evidence logs and interview reports. Authorities say more will be released in coming weeks.  As the video shows, officers appear to be outside Paddock\u2019s suite and a loud bang or gunshot is heard.  \u201cRifles up, move up\u201d an officer can be heard saying at one point in the video.  \u201cCheck under the bed,\u201d another officer orders later in the video.  According to the Review-Journal, the clips come from two different canine officers, Sgt. Joshua Bitsko and David Newton, police said.

                              "text": "On Tuesday's \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Fox News with Laura Ingraham, the host said what many of us have been thinking should have been done a long time ago and that is the Republicans should put their money where their mouths are and stand on the principles they claim to believe in, yet consistently and cowardly cave to political pressure and fund them.  Among some of those things they claim to be against are Obamacare, abortion and illegal immigration. Yet, every single one of those things and more are being funded in the Republican omnibus bill.  By the way, all of those things are unconstitutional spending under our Constitution.  Titling her commentary, \"Washington's real March Madness,\" Ingraham said that people's eyes glaze over because they are sick and tired of hearing about such nonsense.  \"What you need to know, it is a legislative scan because it involves packaging a lot of the federal government\u2019s smaller spending bills into one gargantuan bill,\" she told her audience. \"Then the whole thing can be passed with only a single vote in both the House and the Senate. So long gone are the days of the so-called regular order when appropriations were done the sensible way. Department by department, a lot more transparent that way with each bill being considered separately.\"  \"Under that scenario, Congress and the voters who elected them have more opportunities to either strip out the waste and fund only essential priorities,\" she added. \"It makes sense, right? For years, we have heard leaders in both parties pledged to return to regular order, yet nothing ever happens.\"  \"And it is backed to these mind-numbing continuing resolutions, omnibus nightmares, and shutdown threats, and the result is usually a last-minute budget-busting cramdown,\" Ingraham continued. \"Sure enough, as spring kicks off, here they go again, and it\u2019s really ugly.\"  Of course, establishment Republicans continue spending like there is no tomorrow due to the political pressure brought by the media and Democrats. In some sense, a lot of us would rather they just took their jersey off and join the other team in the open rather than in the shadows to be honest.  That's not going to happen because they give the appearance that they are on our side. In other words, RINOs are controlled opposition, and yes, they are controlled.  Ingraham then rolled several clips of what she was talking about. Here's the transcript.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: They insist on poison pills and the rest. Hopefully, they will get serious, and we can get this done before it is the 23rd of March. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This budget had to be finished. They wanted to add 160, 170 poison pill amendments, none of which would ever survive a vote on their own on the floor. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Democrats and Republicans have worked together to reject many of the poison bill pill riders from President Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Meanwhile, conservatives are in revolt, because they are free of all the old sequestration cap and big shocker, it increases spending. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This idea that all the bills come together in one big, what we call an omnibus \u2014 ominous might be a better word. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are looking at a trillion plus dollar deficit perhaps as early as this October when the numbers come out. You know that is under a Republican administration. We need to do better. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have gotten this bad habit of thinking money here is free. It falls from the heavens and money is free. It is not. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I love that. This means Republicans will need, of course, Democratic votes to pass my pass the measure in both chambers and this means more add-ons, more giveaways, more junk. It is a total mess. Do you remember what Trump promised? He promised to cut spending, to defund boondoggles, and, yes, to drain the swamp. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s two illegal executive amnesties and when he defied federal law and the Constitution. The Trump administration will cancel all federal funding for sanctuary cities. We will end illegal immigration, keep the drugs from pouring into our communities. We are not going to allow them to are not going to fund as long as we have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But as of tonight, it looks like the stuff that should be funded by the Republican majority won\u2019t be touched at all. Planned Parenthood, sanctuary cities, Obama\u2019s executive amnesties, and this is my favorite, almost a billion dollars for a tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey. It is a disguised earmark for Chuck Schumer. Nice going, Chuck and two of the most liberal states in America benefit. And that is the short list. It passes for a law. This Freddy Krueger-like omnibus bill will include over a trillion dollars in spending, $1.3 trillion.  She then concluded that the bill will most assuredly pass with little if no debate or scrutiny.  \"My friends, this is just sheer madness,\" Ingraham said. \"It is time to stand on principle without fear of a government shutdown. It is time to educate the public about how both parties got off-board.\"  \"Yes, you have to compromise if necessary, but with full transparency, and, if possible, not on the core issues,\" she concluded. \"You are the majority, after all. Start really helping President Trump drain the swamp. Don\u2019t add to it. You\u2019ll do the country good, and you just might surprise all experts in November.\"  On that last part, I would like to ask Ms. Ingraham exactly what those core issues that can't be compromised are because I don't see any appeal to limited constitutional spending which would eliminate a lot more spending than that which is most controversial and apparently unconstitutional. It would eliminate all spending that supports the unconstitutional agencies and programs of the central government along with the welfare programs and empire building that we have been engaged in keeping up for decades.  The fact that these politicians keep their power by indebting the American people through unconstitutional spending just demonstrates how corrupt DC has become and if we cannot clean it up, then we need to start petitioning the states to abolish it, just like Jefferson said, and start anew. And make no mistake, Republicans are just as much a part of the problem of unconstitutional spending as the Democrats.  The only people who truly fear a government shutdown are the politicians in DC, not the people.",
