Later this evening, we expect the House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. I\u2019m grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses. At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll. You see states are starting to open up now, and it\u2019s very exciting to see. I think it\u2019s very awe-inspiring. We\u2019re coming out of it, and we\u2019re coming out of it well. And we\u2019re \u2014 really, I\u2019m very happy the governors have been \u2014 the governors, really, have been doing a really good job working with us, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s, really, pretty impressive to see. I\u2019ve spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying we\u2019re leading the way. We\u2019re really leading the way in so many different ways. I\u2019m also very pleased that Harvard \u2014 as you know, it\u2019s Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and colleges, and also large businesses have sent funds back to us. And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at. And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it\u2019s about $350 million, and they\u2019ve either not gone out or we\u2019ve renegotiated it and they\u2019re not getting them. So \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 in a couple of cases, they\u2019re sending them back and sending them back immediately. So I think it was very nice. I want to thank Harvard in particular. They acted very quickly and decisively. And they agreed, when they heard the facts, that they should not be getting it. So we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and other institutions. The bill also includes $30 billion to support small lending institutions serving distressed communities, helping countless African American and Hispanic American small businesses. As we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggest that we\u2019re making great progress. In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak \u2014 week. Forty percent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases. Forty-six states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms. That\u2019s a big number. To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance. And we all understand that very well; we\u2019ve gone over it many, many times. This includes practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering. A safe and phased reopening of our economy \u2014 it\u2019s very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all, in any way. On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work, to take our country back. We\u2019re winning this, and we\u2019re going to win it, and we\u2019re going to keep watching. We\u2019re going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy. With each passing day, we\u2019re learning more and more about this enemy. The scientists at DHS have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates, and surfaces. The findings confirm that the virus survives better in cold or in drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments. I have to say that, very excitingly, we\u2019re going to have somebody up; Bill will be up in just a little while. It was a great report you gave. And he\u2019s going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight. Wait until you hear the numbers. You won\u2019t even believe them. U.S. trials of the COVID-19 have been going on and have been approved in the United States, Germany, UK, and China. That\u2019s big news. And we\u2019re \u2014 a lot of trials are going on. We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this, both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutics. We must be careful in all conditions, but we will \u2014 we will get this done. We\u2019re very close to a vaccine. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not very close to testing because when the testing starts, it takes a period of time. But we\u2019ll get it done. And I want to thank the head of DHS Science and Technology, Bill Bryan, for what he\u2019s going to be doing and what he\u2019s going to be saying and the report that he\u2019s about to give. I think it\u2019s going to be something that nobody has ever heard. It\u2019ll be brand-new information and very important information. My administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacture and delivery of critical medical supplies. We finalized three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days. And as you know, we\u2019re also using a sterilization process. Some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well. We just want the hospitals and the institutions, where it is, to use it. A lot of people don\u2019t use it. They\u2019re so used to getting a new mask, they don\u2019t want to use it. They want to go and immediately get a new one. We\u2019re asking them to use the sterilization process. Every bit as good \u2014 up to 20 times. Think of that. In addition to ramping up our domestic assembly lines, we also have airlifted nearly 750 million pieces of personal protective equipment into the United States through our Project Airbridge, which has been an incredible thing to watch. It\u2019s really a military operation. The Vice President is now providing each governor with an exhaustive count[y]-by-county breakdown of the privately distributed personal protection. And this is equipment and things that are incredible. It\u2019s personal protective equipment. It\u2019s incredible, and it\u2019s all brand new and at the highest level. We\u2019re getting only the highest level. And also, we\u2019re looking at essential gear within their states, and it\u2019s being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak. This way, the governor should know exactly what\u2019s being delivered through a private-sector supply chain within their states, as well as through the Project Airbridge. We\u2019re trying to get it immediately from the plane to the state. When we can\u2019t do that, we bring it into our facilities and get it to the governors. And we\u2019re getting them fast, and we\u2019re notifying them very strongly so they know it\u2019s there. Governors can use this information to quickly ensure that they get materials where and when they are needed. Today, I also want to extend my special thanks to our nation\u2019s incredible county emergency management teams who have been working relentlessly for weeks around the clock, end on end, to serve their communities, help distribute critical supplies, and save countless American lives. We salute these heroic officials on the frontlines. As we continue to develop potential therapies, the FDA has recently begun a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donated from the blood of those who have recovered from the virus. The blood of these donors contains antibodies that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who are sick \u2014 and frankly, those that are very sick. Nearly 3,000 patients are now enrolled in the Expanded Access Program, receiving transfusions nationwide. And I want to thank all of the people that recovered, for what they\u2019ve done. They \u2014 as I said yesterday, they raise their hand when they barely can walk, and they\u2019re saying, \u201cI want to donate blood. I want to donate whatever it is that you want, because we want to help people.\u201d It\u2019s really quite incredible. Convalescent plasma will also be used to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that does not have to be matched with a particular blood type. This concentrated antibody treatment could be used as a preventative measure to keep healthcare workers and other high-risk populations from contracting the virus in the first place. A very big deal. Clinical trials of these products are slated to begin within weeks, and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution. I urge Americans to get in there and keep doing what you\u2019re doing, because again, we want those people recovering or recovered from coronavirus to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help. And they\u2019ve been so great, and I just appreciate it. My administration has also partnered with leading \u2014 and we have really been establishing some great partnerships with leading technology companies and scientific journals to create a database of 52,000 scholarly articles on the virus that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. Top AI experts are now using this wealth of data to gain insights into potential therapies. And we\u2019re collaborating with tech firms, universities, and our national labs to harness American supercomputers in the search for treatments and vaccines. That search is going on, and it\u2019s being \u2014 I think you\u2019ll see in the future \u2014 you\u2019ll see it\u2019s very successful. Ultimately, it\u2019ll be a tremendous success. Great progress is being made at a rapid pace \u2014 a pace like no other. We have every hope that with the full might and resources of American science and technology, and with the courage and devotion of the American people who have been so incredible, we will end this plague, and together we will restore the full measure of American strength and power and prosperity. Our country is going to do fantastically well. You see what\u2019s going on. There is a pent-up demand in our country to get it back right where it was and maybe even better, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. So with that, I\u2019d like to ask Mike Pence to come up \u2014 Vice President. Say a few words please, Mike. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. And good afternoon. Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force met. And while our hearts are with the families of those who have lost their life to the coronavirus and those who are struggling with serious illness today, our team, led by Dr. Deborah Birx, informs us that the data continues to show promising signs of progress. The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans all appear to be past their peak. And we are seeing consistent declines in hospitalization and cases in regions across the country. Our only conclusion is that we\u2019re getting there, America, because the American people have put into practice the President\u2019s guidelines of social distancing because you\u2019ve been listening and adhering to the guidance of state and local officials. We are \u2014 we\u2019re making \u2014 we\u2019re making meaningful progress. In a very real sense, sparing Americans to be exposed to the coronavirus and, no less extent, saving lives. Our task force actually believes, Mr. President, that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead \u2014 as states implement their policies, including phased reopening \u2014 that we\u2019ll preserve those gains. We do believe, by early summer, we could be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us. Earlier today, we also had a conference call led by Secretary Ben Carson and leaders from HUD about the President\u2019s announcement yesterday that he is repurposing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council to focus on the impact of the coronavirus on minority communities. Secretary Carson will convene the council tomorrow, and we\u2019ll be reporting tomorrow afternoon on their progress. We want to thank the more than 270 leaders of organizations dedicated to housing, homelessness, and improving the lives of people across our urban communities \u2014 not only for being with us today, for the way they have partnered with our administration and partnered with state and local officials to put the health of all of their constituencies first. As the President mentioned, we\u2019ll \u2014 you\u2019ll receive a report that our task force received formally this week from Bill Bryan of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. He will outline, as the President said, encouraging news about the impact that heat and sunlight have on the coronavirus, which will increase the confidence that we feel about the coming summer. On the subject of testing: At the present moment, we have reports of 4.93 million tests having been performed across America. And encouraging news: As states have been engaging commercial labs at a higher level across the country, yesterday our commercial lab system did more than 100,000 tests in a single day. So we\u2019re beginning to activate all of the capacity. And tomorrow, at the President\u2019s direction, our task force will convene a conference call with all of the nation\u2019s governors to talk about the progress that they are making on testing. And we\u2019re going to hear from governors about the practices that \u2014 and methods that they are employing to significantly increase testing following our briefing about capacity in laboratories this past Monday. For instance, Governor Mike DeWine just announced that Ohio\u2019s testing has been greatly expanded after the FDA approved Thermo Fisher\u2019s new extraction reagent, saying, in his words, that the action, quote, \u201cprobably doubled, maybe even tripled testing in Ohio virtually overnight.\u201d Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota announced, along with the state\u2019s healthcare system, the Mayo Clinic, and the University of Minnesota, what he described as a breakthrough for rapid, widespread testing \u2014 able to test more than 20,000 people using a molecular test per day. Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa launched the Test Iowa Initiative that will triple testing capacity by partnering with Nomi Health and DOMO. She also worked with the University of Iowa Hospitals to leverage further capacity. And Governor Eric Holcomb and Governor Andy Beshear, of Indiana and Kentucky respectively, both announced additional drive-through testing locations. Our priority has always been to focus first on those impacted by the coronavirus and then on those extraordinary healthcare workers ministering to their needs every day. And I know, Mr. President, how proud you are that our men and women in uniform have come alongside our healthcare workers in communities most impacted, and I know the American people are proud as well. As of today, FEMA reports that 35,000 National Guard have been deployed across the country to aid in our coronavirus response. Governor Kevin Stitt of Ohio [Oklahoma] actually deployed the National Guard to hospitals across the state to evaluate protective equipment and hospital capacity and report it in to state emergency management and FEMA. And Governor Greg Abbott of Texas actually mobilized more than 1,200 National Guard and 45 teams to provide greater access to testing. Along with the National Guard, at the President\u2019s direction today, more than 4,500 active duty military doctors, nurses, and medical assistants have been deployed across the country. Yesterday, 1,013 medical professionals in our military were actually deployed to 19 hospitals in 7 states to support those amazing healthcare workers. And with 4.4 million more Americans filing for unemployment in the past week, I joined the President in welcoming passage in the House today of the Paycheck Protection Program. It\u2019ll support working families. It\u2019ll allow small businesses to keep people on the payroll for a period of two months. But it also, as the President requested, included $75 billion to assist hospitals across the country. And in that spirit, the President and I will continue to urge states across the country: Given the unique burden on hospitals, we are now encouraging states to restart elective surgeries, wherever possible \u2014 either statewide or on a county-by-county basis. We recognize the role elective surgeries play in finances for local hospitals and we\u2019ll be working with states to enable that. In that vein, Governor Doug Ducey exec- \u2014 issued an executive order not long ago, allowing elective surgeries beginning May 1 for hospitals that meet certain preparedness criteria. And Indiana\u2019s governor, Eric Holcomb, is allowing elective clinical procedures to begin on April 21st. Finally, Mr. President, the task force received today our first report on state reopening plans. At the present moment, 16 states have released formal reopening plans. Thirteen of those were actually released since you unveiled the Opening Up America Guidelines to our governors and to the nation last week. And to your point, Mr. President, states are beginning to make those plans. And we\u2019re encouraged to see so many states embracing the phased approach to reopening their economies that\u2019s contemplated in our Guidelines for Opening Up America Again. For instance, Governor Mike Parson of Missouri announced the \u201cShow Me Strong\u201d Recovery Plan as two initial phases intended to protect the most at-risk. Governor Tom Wolf announced the Plan for Pennsylvania that would begin May 8th \u2014 will end a stay-at-home order for just portions of Pennsylvania. But the plan, again, requires regions to have fewer than 50 new positive cases per 100,000 for a period of 14 days, and it also lays out a phased reopening roadmap. Governor Kate Brown of Oregon updated their framework for reopening, doing three phases \u2014 again, on a county-by-county basis. And Governor Brad Little of Idaho released \u201cRebound Idaho\u201d in just the last few days that will consist of four phases and require specific criteria that Idaho and businesses need to meet to begin to reopen. Mr. President, with the \u2014 with the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, states are making plans. And at your direction, our task force will continue to work very closely, providing them with the data, providing them with the resources to be able to implement those plans in a safe and responsible way. So, with that, let me just end where I began, and to say thank you to the American people. The progress that we are seeing is a testament to what all of you have done; to our extraordinary healthcare workers; to a partnership between the federal government and to state and local official. And I\u2019m confident it\u2019s also owing to the prayers of millions of Americans each and every day. All of that combined, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re slowing the spread. We\u2019re protecting the most vulnerable. We\u2019re saving lives. And every single day, we are one day closer to opening up America again. With that, Mr. President, I\u2019d be pleased to call Bill forward. Bill Bryan leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security and now will make a presentation on their recent study. ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you, Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Bill. ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: \u2014 for this opportunity to do this today. Good afternoon everybody. My name is Bill Bryan and I lead the Science and Technology Directorate at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Over the last several months, we\u2019ve intensified the Department\u2019s R&D efforts to identify and deliver information that informs our response to COVID-19. S&T is working to identify, develop, deploy, and deploy the tools and information to support our response to this crisis. As part of our efforts, we\u2019re leveraging the unique capabilities of S&T\u2019s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center to study the biology of the COVID-19 virus. This center is a high-biocontainment laboratory located in Frederick, Maryland. It was established in the early 2000s, in response to the Amerithrax attacks, and where we study, characterize, analyze, and develop countermeasures for biological threats to the homeland. We work closely with the CDC, FDA, HHS, and also our Department of Defense colleagues and many others. Yesterday, I shared the emerging results of our work that we\u2019re doing now with the Coronavirus Task Force. And today, I would like to share certain trends that we believe are important. If I may have the first slide, please. And while that\u2019s coming up, our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus \u2014 both surfaces and in the air. We\u2019ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favorable to the virus. So let me illustrate with this first slide. If you look to the right, you\u2019ll see that term \u201chalf-life,\u201d with a bunch of timestamps on there. First, let me tell you what a \u201chalf-life\u201d is. We don\u2019t measure the virus as far as how long we live on the surface; we have to measure the decay of the virus in terms of its half-life, because we don\u2019t know certain elements. We don\u2019t know how much a person expectorates when he \u2014 when he spits \u2014 right? \u2014 when he sneezes, whatever the case may be. We don\u2019t know how much virus is in there. So it\u2019s \u2014 that has a long \u2014 a bearing on how long the virus is going to be alive and active. So we measure it in half life because half-life doesn\u2019t change. So if you look at an 18-hour half-life, what you\u2019re basically saying is that every 18 hours, the virus \u2014 it\u2019s the life of the virus is cut in half. So if you start with 1,000 particles of the virus, in 18 hours, you\u2019re down to 500. And 18 hours after that, you\u2019re down to 250, and so on and so forth. That\u2019s important, as I explain in the rest of the chart. If you look at the first three lines, when you see the word \u201csurface,\u201d we\u2019re talking about nonporous surfaces: door handles, stainless steel. And if you look at the \u2014 as the temperature increases, as the humidity increases, with no sun involved, you can see how drastically the half-life goes down on that virus. So the virus is dying at a much more rapid pace, just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity. If you look at the fourth line, you inject summer \u2014 the sunlight into that. You inject UV rays into that. The same effects on line two \u2014 as 70 to 35 degrees with 80 percent humidity on the surface. And look at line four, but now you inject the sun. The half-life goes from six hours to two minutes. That\u2019s how much of an impact UV rays has on the virus. The last two lines are aerosols. What does it do in the air? We have a very unique capability \u2014 I was discussing this with the President prior to coming out; he wanted me to convey it to you \u2014 on how we do this. I believe we\u2019re the only lab in the country that has this capability. But if you can imagine a Home Depot bucket \u2014 a five-gallon Home Depot bucket \u2014 we\u2019re able to take a particle \u2014 and this was developed and designed by our folks at the NBACC. We\u2019re able to take a particle of a virus and suspend it in the air inside of this drum and hit it with various temperatures, various humidity levels, multiple different kinds of environmental conditions, to include sunlight. And we\u2019re able to measure the decay of that virus while it\u2019s suspended in the air. This is how we do our aerosol testing. We worked with John Hopkin Applied Physics Lab, and we actually developed a larger drum to do actually more testing. And it\u2019s four times the size of that. So this is the capability that we bring to this effort. So, in summary, within the conditions we\u2019ve tested to date, the virus in droplets of saliva survives best in indoors and dry conditions. The virus does not survive as well in droplets of saliva. And that\u2019s important because a lot of testing being done is not necessarily being done, number one, with the COVID-19 virus, and number two, in saliva or respiratory fluids. And thirdly, the virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions. And when you \u2014 when you look at that chart, look at the aerosol as you breathe it; you put it in a room, 70 to 75 degrees, 20 percent humidity, low humidity, it lasts \u2014 the half-life is about an hour. But you get outside, and it cuts down to a minute and a half. A very significant difference when it gets hit with UV rays. And, Mr. President, while there are many unknown links in the COVID-19 transmission chain, we believe these trends can support practical decision making to lower the risks associated with the virus. If I can have my next slide. And when that \u2014 while that comes up, you\u2019ll see a number of some practical applications. For example, increasing the temperature and humidity of potentially contaminated indoor spaces appears to reduce the stability of the virus. And extra care may be warranted for dry environments that do not have exposure to solar light. We\u2019re also testing disinfectants readily available. We\u2019ve tested bleach, we\u2019ve tested isopropyl alcohol on the virus, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids. And I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds, and that\u2019s with no manipulation, no rubbing \u2014 just spraying it on and letting it go. You rub it and it goes away even faster. We\u2019re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the COVID-19 virus in saliva. This is not the end of our work as we continue to characterize this virus and integrate our findings into practical applications to mitigate exposure and transmission. I would like to thank the President and thank the Vice President for their ongoing support and leadership to the department and for their work in addressing this pandemic. I would also like to thank the scientists, not only in S&T and the NBACC, but to the larger scientific and R&D community. Thank you very much. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Bill. Q Mr. Bryan \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. So I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you\u2019re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous \u2014 whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light \u2014 and I think you said that that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you\u2019re going to test that too. It sounds interesting. ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: We\u2019ll get to the right folks who could. THE PRESIDENT: Right. And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds \u2014 it sounds interesting to me. So we\u2019ll see. But the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s pretty powerful. Steve, please. Q You\u2019re saying that the country will be in a better place by early summer. Does that mean you\u2019re going to need to extend the social distancing guidelines until then? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we may, and we may go beyond that. We\u2019re going to have to see where it is. And I think people are going to know. You\u2019re going to know. I\u2019m going to know. I think people are going to know just out of common sense. At some point, we won\u2019t have to do that. But until we feel it\u2019s safe, we\u2019re going to be extending. Q You said you have 23 cases where new cases \u2014 23 states where new cases are on decline. What does that mean about when the country can be safely reopened to a more normal point? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, but it means we\u2019re going to watch those cases very carefully. I think we\u2019ve all gotten very good at it. We\u2019ve gotten good at tracing. We see where the cases are, where they\u2019re going, and we\u2019re going to be watching it. And it\u2019s called \u201ccontainment.\u201d At a certain point, we\u2019re going to be able to contain. And, you know, when you see this, a lot of people have been talking about summer. Maybe this is one of the reasons. We\u2019ve \u2014 I once mentioned that maybe it does go away with heat and light. And people didn\u2019t like that statement very much. The \u2014 the fake news didn\u2019t like it at all. And I just threw it out as a suggestion, but it seems like that\u2019s the case, because when it\u2019s on a surface that would last for a long time, when that surface is outside, it goes away very quickly. It dies very quickly with the sun. Yeah, go ahead. Q You said yesterday that you\u2019re going to look into Senator McConnell\u2019s suggestion for allowing states to declare bankruptcy versus the aid \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we\u2019ll look into it, and I have been looking into it. I\u2019ve been talking to a lot of the different senators, but I don\u2019t want to talk about it now. That was a very interesting presentation. Go ahead, Jon. Q Well, I wanted to talk about McConnell\u2019s suggestion that aid to the states amounts to a blue \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I just told you I\u2019m not talking about it now. Q \u2014 to a blue-state (inaudible). THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll talk about it later. Q Okay. THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019d like to talk about something that, right now, is of more interest to people. Q Could I ask Mr. Bryan a question? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Sure. Q Thank you. When you started your presentation, you described this as an emerging result. Does this mean your study is conclusive? Is there more work to do? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: We\u2019re continuing with that. For example, on the aerosol side, you notice the figures were 20 percent humidity. We\u2019re looking at higher humidity levels. We would expect that would even have a greater impact on the virus. We\u2019re looking at other types of disinfectants. And \u2014 and so we\u2019re \u2014 this is a \u2014 as a scientific community, we\u2019re continuing to study the virus to understand its characteristics. Q Mr. Bryan, can you explain why some hotspots we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. are hot and humid, like New Orleans, for example? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: Let me explain \u2014 if you look at the coronavirus as a chain with many links, what we\u2019ve done through our study is we\u2019ve identified some of the weak links in that chain, that the virus \u2014 the transmission of the virus depends upon. We identified that heat and humidity is a weakness in that chain. We\u2019ve identified that sunlight, solar light, UV rays is a weakness in that chain. That doesn\u2019t take away the other activities \u2014 the guidance from the White House, the guidance from the CDC and others on the actions and steps that people need to take to protect themselves. This is just another \u2014 another tool in our tool belt, right? Another \u2014 another weapon in the fight that we can add to it and, in the summer, we know that summer-like conditions are going to create an environment where the transmission can be decreased. And that\u2019s an opportunity for us to get ahead. Q But I \u2014 just, can I ask about \u2014 the President mentioned the idea of cleaners, like bleach and isopropyl alcohol you mentioned. There\u2019s no scenario that that could be injected into a person, is there? I mean \u2014 ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: No, I\u2019m here to talk about the findings that we had in the study. We won\u2019t do that within that lab and our lab. So \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It wouldn\u2019t be through injection. We\u2019re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn\u2019t work. But it certainly has a big effect if it\u2019s on a stationary object. Q Mr. Bryant, are we simplifying it too much by saying that it\u2019d be better with the warmer weather and the sun coming out more and more, that people would be outside than staying inside their home, confined to the four walls of their house? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: It would be irresponsible for us to say that we feel that the summer is just going to totally kill the virus and that if it\u2019s a free-for-all and that people ignore those guidelines. That is not the case. We have an opportunity, though, to get ahead with what we know now and factor that into the decision making for what opens and what doesn\u2019t. THE PRESIDENT: But so are you saying, on surfaces, the heat, the hot summer, and whatever other conditions \u2014 humidity and lack of humidity \u2014 that that would have an impact so that on surfaces, where it can be picked up, it will die fairly quickly in the summer, whereas in the winter, it wouldn\u2019t die so quickly? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: Yes, Mr. President. When it\u2019s exposed to UV rays \u2014 take playground equipment, for example: The UV rays hitting a piece of playground equipment will kill the virus when it hits that \u2014 when it hits on the playground equipment. But underneath, where the sun does not get, if someone touched that and had it on their hands, it could still be there, right? Because it has to be in direct light of the UV rays. THE PRESIDENT: If it\u2019s on somebody\u2019s hands, right? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: Yes. THE PRESIDENT: And they haven\u2019t touched their face and all of the things that we\u2019ve all been \u2014 ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: If it\u2019s exposed to the sun, it\u2019ll \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I know, but if they\u2019re outside \u2014 right \u2014 and their hands are exposed to the sun, will that kill it as though it were on a piece of metal or something else? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: Not \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say it will at the same rate, because it\u2019s a non-porous surface. But what we do know \u2014 what we do know is that we looked at the worst-case scenario, and the virus lives longer on non-porous surfaces. So porous surfaces, it doesn\u2019t look quite as long. So, in theory, what you said is correct. THE PRESIDENT: This is sort of semi-non-porous, right? This, right? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: That\u2019s true. Yes, Mr. President. Q Mr. Bryan, how can the governors \u2014 (Cross-talk.) THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, go ahead. Q One at a time. Mr. Bryan, how should governors who are opening their states, working on that, will incorporate the findings of this study into those guidelines? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: I would leave that up to the governors. This is a \u2014 Q What was your advice? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: This is a decision \u2014 this factors into their decision process. As I mentioned, with knowing this knowledge and having this knowledge, as we continue to study and further know what the virus does and how it reacts, it could impact the way a governor will look at when he opens in a state, how he opens it, in what environments these things are opened up. But I leave that up to the governors to make that decision. Q Obviously, at the moment, the advice is stay at home. By the summer, could we be flipping that and saying you\u2019d be much better off being outside with UV rays or the humidity that Washington brings in August? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: I would not go contrary to the guidance that have been issued right now. I think, though, to tell you that if \u2014 if I\u2019m having an event with my family, I\u2019m doing it in the driveway or in the backyard, not inside the house with my children. THE PRESIDENT: In fact, I\u2019m thinking about moving outside to the Rose Garden. (Laughter.) No, it\u2019s a very interesting question, actually. Okay. Please, go ahead. In the back. Q Mr. Bryan, how much more research \u2014 how much more time would it take to have conclusive results that could be used here? You said these were emerging results? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: We \u2014 we first were able to receive the virus back in February, is when we started testing. And it is a science-based approach. Science is a process; the doctor can attest to that. It doesn\u2019t necessarily line up with goals and targets and other things. It is what it is. But we are now starting to get results. And \u2014 and we\u2019re \u2014 every week or two weeks, we\u2019re starting to find out something new and something different. And in talking to the task force and the Vice President, he\u2019s already asked us to come to him every time we come up with some new discoveries that we could be \u2014 that we could share to the public. THE PRESIDENT: Phil? Q Yeah, sir, have you compared notes with your counterparts and other foreign governments or in private industry who might have been studying the same thing? And do their findings show the same result that you found here? ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN: We have. We do have a very good partnership with a lot of our allies. We work closely with them on this particular topic. We actually authored a document called the Master Questions List. If you go to DHS S&T\u2019s website, we\u2019ve already had about 17,000 hits on this document. It actually outlines what all the countries in the world are doing to fill the certain gaps of knowledge that don\u2019t exist within the virus and what we do know. And that is really what targets and drives the science community to say, \u201cAll right, what don\u2019t we know now, so we don\u2019t duplicate what other people have done?\u201d So we\u2019ve championed that document, it\u2019s well referenced, and I would encourage you to look at that. THE PRESIDENT: And we are working with other countries on vaccines, as you know. Yeah. Go ahead. Please. Q Thanks, Mr. President. If there is a summer ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time? THE PRESIDENT: Say it? In the beginning \u2014 what? Q Oh, so if there is a summer, sort of, ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time to be better prepared for a possible resurgence in the fall than we were the first time? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019ll tell you one thing: I think a lot of people are going to go outside all of a sudden. People that didn\u2019t want to go outside, they\u2019ll be going. This was a \u2014 to me this is very \u2014 really, a very interesting meeting. We covered it in great detail. And these are incredible people at that \u2014 we could call it a laboratory, because that\u2019s essentially what it is. It\u2019s a super laboratory. It\u2019s a lot of things going on in that laboratory. Q Right, but what would you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: A lot of very interesting things going on in that laboratory. Yeah. Q What would you and other areas that the government need to do on testing, for example, or other things like that to be prepared if it came back in the fall? THE PRESIDENT: Sure, Mike. Go ahead. Go ahead. Q How would you take advantage of the summer? THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s actually a very good question. It\u2019s something the task force already has begun discussing. That we are \u2014 if \u2014 a combination of factors. Let me say again: As states put into practice the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, implement safe and responsible plans to open up their economies along the lines that the President unveiled a week ago today; as people continue to properly exercise social distancing, as is recommended in each phase, that, in combination with some of these findings, could well give us a summer respite from the coronavirus. And our team is already speaking about working on a continuous basis through this summer. Every single day we\u2019re increasing testing. Every single day, air bridge flights are coming into the country. There are \u2014 I can promise you, at the President\u2019s direction, there will be no letting up on \u2014 on making sure that our hospitals have the equipment, have the personal protective supplies for medical personnel. There\u2019ll be no letting up on the development of therapeutics by our great pharmaceutical companies that are driving toward a vaccine as soon as it is possible to make available to the public. And there\u2019ll be no letting up on continuing to scale testing \u2014 already, more than anyone in the world. But by next fall, we\u2019ll have a broad range of testing, a variety of different means. And that\u2019s why we say with confidence that should the coronavirus reemerge at any point next fall or next winter, we will be prepared to deal with it, identify it, do the contact tracing and isolation to ensure that \u2014 that we \u2014 we deal with this epidemic in the manner that we \u2014 that we deal with infectious diseases. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Yeah. Go ahead. Q Mr. President, on the subject of medical research: Why have you stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine as a cure? THE PRESIDENT: I haven\u2019t at all. I haven\u2019t at all. What are you say- \u2014 we\u2019ll see what happens. Q You haven\u2019t talked about it in several days. THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ve had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps aren\u2019t so good. I don\u2019t know. I just read about one, but I also read many times good. So I haven\u2019t at all. And it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a great \u2014 for malaria, for lupus, for other things. And we\u2019ll see what it is. But, I guess, Deborah, they have many, many studies going on on that. So we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll be able to learn. Q Have you looked at the veteran study that shows that \u2014 that the death rate is higher \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I have not. I haven\u2019t seen it. I have not seen it. Go ahead, please. Q Mr. President, we\u2019re now over 26 million new jobless claims over five weeks. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Yeah. Q How \u2014 the Vice President talked about this summer getting better. But how \u2014 what do your economists tell you about the time it\u2019s going to take to you and the U.S. to create the jobs back? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I know a lot about economists. Q August? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q September? THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Q October? THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me go. We \u2014 we know the rest of the question, right? So I \u2014 I know a lot about economists, and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good an idea as anybody, and I think our economy will start to pick up very substantially, as soon as the states get open. And that\u2019s happening as we speak, and it\u2019s actually very exciting, and people are just \u2014 just thrilled to see it, because our country has to get back to work. They want to get back to work. You see that, whether it\u2019s a demonstration or just in talking to people. They\u2019re going to get back to work, and they\u2019re going to get back to work very fast. States are advanced. I look at Gavin Newson \u2014 was \u2014 Newsom was very nice today. He wrote a beautiful statement about \u2014 we sent him a lot of \u2014 a lot of things that he needed. Okay? Things \u2014 different things that he needed. We got \u2014 we got it taken care of. They\u2019ve done very well in California, as you know. They\u2019re doing really well in Florida. They\u2019re doing well in a lot of places. New York and New Jersey got hit very hard. They\u2019re doing very well. I spoke again with Governor Cuomo, with Governor Murphy. They\u2019re doing \u2014 they\u2019re doing a great job. And here\u2019s the thing: We have to see. They got hit hard. Everyone close together \u2014 tight in. People don\u2019t realize New Jersey is very tight. You realize that because you\u2019ve been covering it for a long time, but very tight. New York obviously is very tight. They\u2019re doing a terrific job. I \u2014 I think for the most part \u2014 I\u2019ll be able to tell you when it\u2019s all over, but a lot of the governors have done a really terrific job. Some I don\u2019t think have, to be honest. But we\u2019ll be talking about that in future. Yes, go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. In a new interview today with Time Magazine, Dr. Fauci said that the U.S. is not in a situation where we can say we are where we want to be, with regard to testing capacity. He said we need much more testing capacity, as well as tests. So why do you keep saying we have a tremendous testing capacity? And do we have a national strategy that goes beyond tracking just what the states are doing? THE PRESIDENT: The answer is yes. And the answer is \u2014 as you know, and as I\u2019ve said many times \u2014 we\u2019re very advanced in testing. Other countries are calling us to find out what are we doing. And, by the way, within two weeks, you\u2019ll see numbers and you\u2019ll see different forms of testing \u2014 just like we came up with the Abbott Laboratories machine, which gives it to you in five minutes \u2014 that everybody wants. Everybody is asking, \u201cCan we get that?\u201d But you can only make them so fast. But, as you know, we\u2019ve done more testing than every other nation combined, and that\u2019s a big statement. And, you know, when they talk about different tests and different things, we\u2019re also a bigger nation than most. And so, when they look at statistics \u2014 because, statistically, we\u2019re doing phenomenally, in terms of mortality, in terms of all of the different elements that you can judge. When you look, Germany and ourselves are doing very well. We are very accurate in the reporting of numbers. In fact, I\u2019ll go a step further. As you know, in New York, they actually added quite a few deaths to a list that was done in New York. And they added a number of deaths. We\u2019re very, very \u2014 highly accurate. And then you\u2019ll look at certain lists of other countries. Some are so obvious just to look at, where obviously the number is ridiculous, in the form of low, because they\u2019re not accurate counts. They\u2019re not even close to accurate counts. In fact, they\u2019re insulting to look at them. So we\u2019ve done very well. Again, testing \u2014 we\u2019re doing very well on testing. We\u2019ve tested far more than anybody else anywhere in the world. And within a short period of time, you\u2019ll be hearing about new tests that are coming out that are going to be incredible. Steve, go ahead. Q Do you agree with Dr. Fauci that we\u2019re just not there yet? THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t agree with him on that. No, I think we\u2019re doing a great job in testing. I don\u2019t agree. If he said that, I don\u2019t agree with him. Yes. Q Are you considering ways to get \u2014 to ramp up production of that Abbott rapid test? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well, they\u2019re doing it. I\u2019ll tell you, Steve, they \u2014 they\u2019re doing it at a level that they\u2019ve never done it before. Abbott is a great company. It\u2019s a very big, highly respected company. They came up with this machine where you do it \u2014 I\u2019ve done it both ways. I\u2019ve done it this way and I didn\u2019t like it. And I\u2019ve done it the Abbott way, where you literally just touch and, five minutes later, you know the answer. And we use them in the White House. I think you folks have been given that opportunity, which is much more pleasant than the first way that they looked at you. Right? We\u2019re making them \u2014 hundreds of thousands of machines. The advantage to the other tests and the laboratory tests is we can get millions and millions of those tests done. It takes a day or two days. But \u2014 you know, because it\u2019s really a delivery situation, more than anything else. The test itself goes quickly once it gets to the laboratory. But as we have found and as we have, I think, shown everybody in the room, we have many laboratories. We have thou- \u2014 we have so many laboratories. Nobody \u2014 nobody \u2014 a lot of the governors did not know that we have this capacity, but we have many laboratories all over our country. Every state has laboratories and some have a lot of them. So I think we will \u2014 we will come up with things as time goes by. Again, when I started, we ended up \u2014 we \u2014 we started with nothing, essentially. What \u2014 we started with a broken test, a test that didn\u2019t work. We started with a test that did very few people, not millions of people. The problem is, if we did 350- \u2014 if we did 350 million tests, one for each person, the media would say, \u201cOh, you should have done two for each person.\u201d No matter what you do, it doesn\u2019t make any difference. It\u2019s just like the ventilators. I talk about it all the time. Nobody ever mentions ventilators. One of the hardest things are ventilators. And now we\u2019re making thousands a week \u2014 thousands of ventilators. And they\u2019re calling from Mexico; they\u2019re calling from many countries. I\u2019ve received today four calls. \u201cWould it be possible to send ventilators?\u201d Right? I got four calls today. I got three calls yesterday. No country is equipped like we are. We have 11 \u2014 we have 11 different places making ventilators. Our country, as you know, doesn\u2019t need them now. Our governors are very happy. But that\u2019s different than test, because with a test you can always say, \u201cOh, we \u2014 we need more.\u201d No, I think we\u2019ve done incredibly well with \u2014 obviously, with ventilators. We\u2019re \u2014 we also have 500 million masks \u2014 500 million masks that are very shortly going to be here. We\u2019ve made millions of masks. We have ordered millions of masks that have arrived and been distributed. We gave one hospital in New York City 300,000 masks. Before the virus, they were using 10,000. And now we got them 300,000, and they got rid of them very quick, which I \u2014 quickly \u2014 which I sort of say, \u201cHow did that happen? Why?\u201d Because they became very valuable \u2014 the masks. I say, \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d But we got \u2014 we have \u2014 we\u2019ve done an amazing job, and we\u2019ve worked with the governors. And when the governors weren\u2019t able \u2014 again, they\u2019re the first line \u2014 when they weren\u2019t able to get something \u2014 like ventilators, they couldn\u2019t get ventilators. They could\u2019ve bought them. You could have bought them, but most of them \u2014 many of them chose not to. So they all needed ventilators. We got the job done. We have \u2014 I\u2019ll be introducing the team when we\u2019re finished with this whole nightmare, this whole curse, this whole plague. But the team that worked on the ventilators was incredible. And the team that work \u2014 and it\u2019s a little bit interchangeable, but the team that\u2019s working on the testing is truly an incredible team. These are brilliant people. And they\u2019re doing it for the country; they\u2019re not doing it for other reasons. Some have been very successful. They\u2019re doing it for the country. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q The House has now passed, since you were here, the relief bill. THE PRESIDENT: Great. Q As you know \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll be signing it probably tonight. Q As you know, there\u2019s no aid to states and localities in that bill. Mitch McConnell, of course, has talked about states seeking bankruptcy protection. He\u2019s also \u2014 his office referred to this as a \u2014 the idea of aiding states as a \u201cblue state\u201d bailout. What do you \u2014 what do say to that? Do you agree with that? Or do you agree with Governor Cuomo that that is a vicious attack on these states that have been hit by \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know if it was a vicious attack, but certainly some people do look at it that way. I\u2019ve spoken to Mitch about it; I\u2019ve spoken to numerous senators about it. And we\u2019re working with senators that are on the other side of the issue, and we\u2019ll see what happens. But we\u2019re looking to do what\u2019s right for the people of this country. We\u2019re looking to do what\u2019s right for a particular state. And we\u2019ll see what happens. But it\u2019s certainly the next thing we\u2019re going to be discussing because some states have \u2014 in all fairness, Jon, some states have not done very well for many years, long before the virus came. You know, you can\u2019t blame the plague \u2014 this horrible plague that came in and, all of a sudden \u2014 you know, they can\u2019t blame that. You look at Illinois \u2014 he\u2019s got a lot of problems long before the virus came in. And so we\u2019ll be talking about it. It\u2019ll be a subject for a period of time. And right now, we\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019ve made this incredible deal for the workers and for small business. And I\u2019m very happy that Harvard didn\u2019t get covered. We actually never sent them the check. But they were very nice about it. We never sent them the money. The old-fashioned way is the check; the new way is send them the money. And we didn\u2019t send them the money. And \u2014 but they were very understanding and they were very nice about it. So was Princeton, so was Stanford, so were a number of other schools that you just don\u2019t associate with this money. So were big companies, as you know. You know, many of them. It was a relatively small amount of money compared to the whole. A very small amount of money compared. But we want it to be fair. We want it to go to the people that it\u2019s supposed to go to. Q But are you open to this idea of state and local \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m open. I\u2019m open. Q I mean, are these \u2014 are these \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m open to ideas that are going to be great for the people of this country. Q Specifically that idea? THE PRESIDENT: And if we can help states, we\u2019re always going to help states. Now, there\u2019s different ways of helping states. Some ways are better than others. So we\u2019re looking. It is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue. It is interesting, you know, if you look around. I mean, the states that seem to have the problem happen to be Democrat. Q Well, New York and New Jersey got hit by this, you know, by this virus really hard, and Massachusetts \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, but New York and New Jersey were in a lot of trouble long before the plague came. I mean, they were \u2014 you know, they had a lot of problems long before the plague came. I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it, spoke to Governor Murphy about it. I spoke with Gavin Newsom about it. And we \u2014 I\u2019m speaking to a lot of people about it, because it\u2019s probably going to be the next thing on the list. A lot of people understand very well what Mitch is saying, and they also understand the other side of the \u2014 the problem. And I\u2019ll be speaking about it. We\u2019re going to do the right thing for our country. The right thing for our country and the right thing for a lot of great people. Okay? Yeah, please. Q Yes, Mr. President, after the presentation we just saw about the heat and the humidity, is it dangerous for you to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people are dying in Florida, considering that this virus has had an outbreak in Singapore, places that are hot and \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, here we go. Q \u2014 are humid? THE PRESIDENT: Here we go. The new \u2014 the new headline is: \u201cTrump Asks People to go Outside. That\u2019s Dangerous.\u201d Here we go. Same old group. You ready? I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m just hearing this \u2014 not really for the first time. I mean, there\u2019s been a rumor that \u2014 you know, a very nice rumor \u2014 that you go outside in the sun, or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses. But now we get it from one of the great laboratories of the world. I have to say, it covers a lot more territory than just this. This is \u2014 this is probably an easy thing, relatively speaking, for you. I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there\u2019s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure. You know \u2014 but if you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. I\u2019m not a doctor. But I\u2019m like a person that has a good you know what. Q But, sir, you\u2019re the President. THE PRESIDENT: Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus? DR. BIRX: Not as a treatment. I mean, certainly fever \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. DR. BIRX: \u2014 is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as \u2014 I\u2019ve not seen heat or (inaudible). THE PRESIDENT: I think it\u2019s a great thing to look at. I mean, you know. Okay? Q But respectfully, sir, you\u2019re the President. And people tuning into these briefings, they want to get information and guidance and want to know what to do. THE PRESIDENT: Hey \u2014 hey, Phil. Q They\u2019re not looking for a rumor. THE PRESIDENT: Hey, Phil. I\u2019m the President and you\u2019re fake news. And you know what I\u2019ll say to you? I\u2019ll say it very nicely. I know you well. Q Why do you say that? THE PRESIDENT: I know you well. Because I know the guy; I see what he writes. He\u2019s a total faker. Q He\u2019s a good reporter. THE PRESIDENT: So, are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? It\u2019s just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant, man. He\u2019s talking about sun. He\u2019s talking about heat. And you see the numbers. So that\u2019s it; that\u2019s all I have. I\u2019m just here to present talent. I\u2019m here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good and if sunlight is good, that\u2019s a great thing as far as I\u2019m concerned. Go ahead. Q Mr. President, you talked a moment ago about vaccines and that we\u2019re close. How close, do you think? The Oxford University study says they could have one by September. Do you think the pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: They could have one of what? Q They could \u2014 they could have a vaccine ready \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 for testing by September. THE PRESIDENT: Oxford is one. Johnson & Johnson is working. They\u2019re also working together. You have many companies working together on a vaccine. Q But then, do you think they\u2019ll scale \u2014 they can scale up production and the pharmaceutical companies will be able to do that quickly? THE PRESIDENT: Oh, we\u2019ll scale it up. If we had a vaccine, it\u2019ll be scaled up very quickly. In fact, some of the companies \u2014 Johnson & Johnson is one \u2014 is scaling up already, before they have the final answer. A number of companies are doing that. You\u2019ll save a lot of time. The normal is you scale up after. I have to say, the FDA has been fantastic. Stephen Hahn \u2014 Dr. Hahn \u2014 has been fantastic. They\u2019re moving along rapidly. Rapidly. Q Would you say \u2014 would you put a timescale on when you think this will \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t want to put a timescale because then the \u2014 the media, the so-called \u2014 so-called \u201cmedia\u201d \u2014 \u201clamestream\u201d media will say, \u201cHe said a time.\u201d I don\u2019t want to say times, because every time I say a time, if you don\u2019t hit it, they\u2019ll say \u2014 so I don\u2019t want to talk about time. But I will say that there\u2019s been tremendous progress made over the last month. Q Could I just ask a very quick question? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q You spoke to Boris Johnson this week. I just wonder how \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I did. Q \u2014 how he sounded, how he was. THE PRESIDENT: I did. Q When do you think he\u2019ll be back at work? THE PRESIDENT: He called me a few days ago. I will tell you, he sounded incredible. I was actually surprised. I thought he\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, Donald, how are you\u2026\u201d He was ready to go. I could \u2014 I\u2019m very surprised to tell you this: It\u2019s like the old Boris. Tremendous energy. Tremendous drive. I was very surprised, because he called me almost, you know, pretty close to when he got out of the hospital. I think he\u2019s doing great. I think he\u2019s doing great. He was so sharp and energetic. Pretty incredible. He\u2019s an incredible guy. He\u2019s a friend of ours and \u2014 and a friend of mine. He loves our country. He loves his country a lot. But he loves our country. He respects our country. And they\u2019re lucky to have him over there. Please. Q Mr. President, you, a couple days ago, said that you might reach out to Kim Jong Un directly, but also that you were working to find out if those reports about him being in possible medical trouble were true. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve either \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I hope he\u2019s not in medical trouble. Q Well \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I hope he\u2019s \u2014 Q \u2014 have you heard anything from North Korea or \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ve gotten along very well with him. And you know, here we are. You would have been in a war with North Korea if I didn\u2019t get elected President. Remember, I was going to be the one that took us into war, with my first day in office. Okay? Here we are. Look at what\u2019s happened. Withdrawal. We\u2019re bringing people home. We\u2019re not going to serve as policemen all over the world. I don\u2019t want to be policemen all over the world. Q But have you been able to leverage that relationship? THE PRESIDENT: And yet I\u2019ve rebuilt our military to a level that it\u2019s never been built at before. Q Have you been able to get more information? THE PRESIDENT: But it\u2019s never recognized by the fake news. Go ahead. Q Have you been able to use that relationship to get more information about his status? THE PRESIDENT: Uh, I think the report was incorrect. Let me just put it that way. I think the report was done by a network that was incorrect. Q So you blame \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m hearing they used old documents. But I \u2014 that\u2019s what I hear. I hear the report was an incorrect report. I hope it was an incorrect report. Q When was the last time you heard from him? THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t want to say. Yeah. Q Since you pointed to me, just a quick question about that. So you haven\u2019t made any contact, though? Just to make sure. THE PRESIDENT: With who? Q The North Koreans. THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t want to say. I won\u2019t say that. Q Okay, so \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: We have a good relationship with North Korea \u2014 as good as you can have. I mean, we have a good relationship with North Korea. I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, and I hope he\u2019s okay. And somebody would say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s terrible.\u201d No, it\u2019s not terrible. I hope he\u2019s okay. And I think it was a fake report done by CNN. Q So can I ask you a question? THE PRESIDENT: What do you have? Go ahead. Q No, I would like \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, that\u2019s enough. Go ahead. Q Can I ask \u2014 Q But that wasn\u2019t my question. THE PRESIDENT: The problem is you don\u2019t write the truth, so, you know, as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2014 Q What are you referencing? THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 I want to go \u2014 I want to go to the next question. Q But can I ask you a question about Rick Bright? THE PRESIDENT: No, not CNN, please. Go ahead. Q The White House has not responded \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: You don\u2019t \u2014 Q \u2014 to these allegations \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I told you \u2014 Q \u2014 to Rick Bright. THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 CNN is fake news. Don\u2019t talk to me. Go ahead, please. Q He says he was \u2014 but he says he was retaliated against and that\u2019s why he was removed from his job. Do you have a response to that? THE PRESIDENT: Okay, next question. Q Mr. President, I have two questions. One on behalf of a colleague who is not here because of social distancing. THE PRESIDENT: Just ask one, please. Q First one: Could you talk about your decision-making process on \u2014 with the governor of Georgia? THE PRESIDENT: About what? Q You, yesterday, said \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: The controversy? Q Well, you know, you \u2014 no. You said yesterday that you told the governor of Georgia \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I did. Q \u2014 you were concerned about \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I had a good talk with the governor of Georgia. Q But there are reports that, earlier in the week, you spoke and you did not convey this kind of message. Was there a change in your thinking? THE PRESIDENT: I did convey the message. I didn\u2019t like the fact that he\u2019s leaving certain things \u2014 I want the states to open more than he does \u2014 much more than he does. But I didn\u2019t like to see spas at this early stage, nor did the doctors. Is that a correct statement, Deborah? I didn\u2019t like to see spas opening, frankly. I didn\u2019t like to see a lot of things happening. And I wasn\u2019t happy with it. And I wasn\u2019t happy with Brian Kemp. I wasn\u2019t at all happy, because \u2014 and I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I\u2019m saying let the governors do it. But I wasn\u2019t happy with Brian Kemp. Spas, beauty parlors, tattoo parlors \u2014 no, that\u2019s \u2014 that \u2014 Q But did your thinking change after \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And, by the way, I want them to open \u2014 excuse me. Q \u2014 a conversation with your medical experts? THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. I want them to open, and I want him to open as soon as possible. And I want the state to open. But I wasn\u2019t happy with Brian Kemp. I will tell you that right now. Yeah, go ahead. Q Sir, are you surprised he defied you on that? Because you made it clear \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, he didn\u2019t. No, he didn\u2019t defy me at all. That\u2019s your language. He didn\u2019t defy me. Q Well, I mean, he\u2019s not \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: You know what happened? I said, \u201cYou make your own decision.\u201d I told him that. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not in the guidelines, but I\u2019m letting you make your own decision. But I want people to be safe, and I want the people in Georgia to be safe, and I don\u2019t want this thing to flare up because you\u2019re deciding to do something that is not in the guidelines.\u201d And I went to Deborah and Dr. Fauci and other people, and they weren\u2019t thrilled about it. And I could have stopped him, but I decided \u2014 and we all agreed \u2014 they got to watch it closely. So we\u2019ll see what happens. I told him very distinctly \u2014 I said \u2014 Mike was there \u2014 I said, \u201cYou do what you think is best.\u201d But if you ask me, am I happy about it? I\u2019m not happy about it, and I\u2019m not happy about Brian Kemp. Go ahead. Q A question for Dr. Birx, if I may, Mr. President, about the rate and the decline of the curve in the U.S. You and the Vice President tonight talking about meaningful progress, promising progress. Could you speak to the rate of decline of cases of in the U.S.? THE PRESIDENT: If we do it quickly, that would be great. Q And just \u2014 if you\u2019re satisfied with \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Because you see it in the charts. I mean, you have to ask the question, but you do see it in the charts. Q And if you have information from other countries that would inform us about the decline. DR. BIRX: Yeah, so, many of you \u2014 and I\u2019ve spoken to all of you from this podium about there\u2019s weekends\u2019 difference in reporting, often a spike on Monday. If you look at Mondays over Mondays, if you look at seven-day reporting, we are starting to go down. We have a long \u2014 we had a long, flat peak, largely driven, of course, by New York, which is about 45 or so percent of the cases. As New York goes down, so will the rest of the country have a decline, even more accelerated. I want to say, though, we have had outbreaks. We\u2019ve had outbreaks in specific prisons. We\u2019ve had outbreaks in specific nursing homes. We\u2019ve had outbreaks in specific plants. And when that happens, that adds two, three hundred, four hundred cases on that single date. So we track, very carefully, not only what the country is doing, but what each state is doing, each county is doing. And we look at delta changes across all of the counties so that we find early warning signals for these types of outbreaks, because we want to \u2014 we want the whole country to go down, but we also want to prevent the outbreaks before they occur. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Please. Q Yes. Thank you. Looking forward to November, to the election, given the risk that the flu and the coronavirus are coming back \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, that\u2019s a \u2014 that\u2019s a problem. Q Yeah \u2014 there could be a problem. Do you think there is a risk that there\u2019ll be \u2014 there will be some \u2014 there will be lack of agreement, lack of legitimacy to the results in a very close election, and people start saying, \u201cWell, a whole bunch of people couldn\u2019t go and vote because they were scared\u201d? THE PRESIDENT: Look, I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen in an election. Q Is there a risk for legitimate elections? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Great question. I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen. We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to who doesn\u2019t want to do debates because of COVID. And lots of things are happening. Right? And I watched a couple of interviews, and I say, \u201cOh, I look forward to this.\u201d But they\u2019re keeping him sheltered because of the coronavirus. And he\u2019s not moving around; he\u2019s not moving too much. And then I watch what the press does to the Republican Party \u2014 and to me, in particular. We had the greatest economy ever put together. We were doing \u2014 this is a month and a half ago. We were doing numbers, the like \u2014 the likes of which we\u2019ve never done. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American \u2014 best employment numbers ever in the history of our country. Our employment numbers, the best in the history of our country: almost 160 million people. The stock market: record numbers, many, many times during my tenure. Many, many times. But now we have a country that we had to close because of this. And, frankly, if we didn\u2019t close it, we would have lost millions of people possibly, but certainly we would have lost a million people. You take the high number and cut it in half, cut it in half again. But whether it would have been 600, 700, 800, you take a look at the travesty that there is. You take a look at this horrible, horrible scene of hospitals with bodies in black body bags, right? Multiply that times 10, 15, or even 20, because that would have happened. So we did the right thing. So far, we did the right thing. So far, we\u2019ve called it right. We\u2019ve mobilized like it was a military operation. And it was largely a militarily operation, between ventilators and testing and so many other things. And we\u2019ve had a lot of good partners. Not all good partners, but we had a lot of good partners. Gavin Newsom today thanked us very much. Gavin Newsom \u2014 California \u2014 thanked us so much for getting him all the things that he needed so he can keep going and keep doing a good job. We got it to him today. Tomorrow, we\u2019re getting him even more. It would\u2019ve been harder for him to get it than us. We agreed to get it. We got it on time. He said, \u201cPromises made, promises kept.\u201d He actually said that in a statement today. We\u2019ve done a good job. We\u2019ve gotten very little credit for the great job we\u2019ve done because of the media. Because the media is not an honest media, in my opinion. Much of it, not all of it. We have some great reporters that I have tremendous respect, but much of the media is not honest. So I can\u2019t tell you about the election. You have a Democrat Party and you have a large portion of the media automatically giving the guy a pass. He\u2019s been given a pass. Whether or not he\u2019s going to be the nominee, I have no idea, but he\u2019s getting a pass. And the media isn\u2019t covering the great job that we\u2019ve done, whether it\u2019s Mike\u2019s task force, which has been incredible; whether it\u2019s the way we mobilized in a war-like operation to build these incredibly complex and very expensive ventilators. They\u2019re very expensive to build and very complex. The job we\u2019ve done has been an amazing job. And I\u2019m not talking about me; I\u2019m talking about everybody. I\u2019m talking about the generals, the admirals, Deborah and Tony, and \u2014 and now Bill. I mean, something we hadn\u2019t heard today. So I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen with the election. I think that had we not gone through a fake Russia, Russia, Russia deal; an impeachment hoax \u2014 it was a total hoax. From the day I got elected \u2014 but, you know, it wasn\u2019t the day; it was many months before I got elected \u2014 this has been a witch hunt that was illegal. It was an illegal witch hunt. It was illegal. And with all of that, I\u2019m doing fine, because the people see we\u2019re doing a great job. And you know what? We\u2019ll continue to do a great job. If we had an honest press, this country would be even greater. Thank you. Thank you very much. END 6:52 P.M. EDT",

The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide. Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing. The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what\u2019s going on. And they\u2019re going down; they\u2019re going in the right direction. Cases in the Boston area are now declining. The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific. And Detroit is past its peak. These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen. It\u2019s very exciting. It was very exciting, even today, watching and seeing what\u2019s happening. And people are getting ready and they\u2019re all excited. I do want to mention a man who\u2019s done a very good job for us: Dr. Robert Redfield. He was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus. Totally misquoted. I spoke to him. He said it was ridiculous. He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time. And corona could be just some little flare-ups that we\u2019ll take care of. We\u2019re going to knock it out. We\u2019ll knock it out fast. But that\u2019s what he was referring to: coming together at the same time. And I think rather than waiting, I\u2019d ask Dr. Redfield to come up, say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn\u2019t say it was a big \u2014 a big explosion. The headline in the Washington Post was totally inaccurate. The statement wasn\u2019t bad in the Post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is \u2014 as I say, that\u2019s fake news. And CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew. They were asked to change it, and they wouldn\u2019t do that. And it was false. So I\u2019ll ask Dr. Redfield, who is, you know, a real professional, to come up and explain. Please. Thank you, Doctor. DR. REDFIELD: Thank you, Mr. President. I really do think it\u2019s important to clarify this as we build the confidence of the American people. When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of the fall, winter \u2014 next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time: influenza and the coronavirus-19. But I think it\u2019s really important to emphasize what I didn\u2019t say. I didn\u2019t say that this was going to be worse. I said it was going to be more complic- \u2014 or more difficult and potentially complicated because we\u2019ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time. I want to emphasize that we continue to build the nation\u2019s public health infrastructure to ensure that we have the capacity to sustain the containment mode. Those of you who heard me talk before, I\u2019ve told you that in January and February \u2014 up to February 27, 28, this nation had 14 cases. We were in the containment mode. And then, unfortunately, the virus overwhelmed where we got into this extreme mitigation. We are building that public health capacity now to make sure that we stay in the containment mode for the upcoming fall and winter season so we will not need to resort to the kind of mitigation that we had to this spring. I have confidence that our public health response of early case recognition that we\u2019ve talked about, isolation, and contact tracing, combined with our plans for increased surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable, will be an effective public health strategy so our nation will be able to maintain itself in the containment mode. Again, that will be supported by the American public\u2019s continued cooperation, obviously in the areas of personal hygiene and the types of social distancing strategies that may be appropriate. The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence. One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we\u2019re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront. Thank you very much. Q Could I just ask a follow-up on that, Dr. Redfield? Q Sir, just to clarify your comments \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: But I don\u2019t know what\u2019s to follow up. Q Well \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: He was misquoted. Totally misquoted. He said they could come together. They didn\u2019t talk about that. And his whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot, so that next fall we don\u2019t have such a big season of flu \u2014 and we possibly won\u2019t. But, as you said, there\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s possible, if the corona even comes back \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to and neither do I. We spoke a great length. And I think the doctor will speak, if you\u2019d like to continue. But we may have some embers \u2014 and we\u2019re going to put them out \u2014 of corona. But we may have a big flu season. But that\u2019s different. Flu is very different from corona. Q Can I just ask him a follow-up question? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, go ahead. Sure. Q Okay. So, Dr. Redfield, the Washington Post \u2014 which, you did the interview with them \u2014 they quoted you as saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be much \u2014 even more difficult than the one we just went through. And when I\u2019ve said this to others, they\u2019ve kind of put their head back, they don\u2019t understand what I mean. We\u2019re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.\u201d Is that what you said to the Washington Post? DR. REDFIELD: Yeah, that\u2019s what I was trying to say to you just a minute ago \u2014 that the issue that I was talking about, about being more difficult, is that we\u2019re going to have two viruses circulating the same time. This spring that we just went through \u2014 February \u2014 we had a benefit of having the flu season ended, so we could use all our flu surveillance systems to say, \u201cWhoops, this is coronavirus. We need to focus.\u201d Next fall and winter, we\u2019re going to have two viruses circulating, and we\u2019re going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus. And so the comment that I made: It\u2019s more difficult. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be more impossible. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be more, as some people have said, \u201cworse.\u201d It just means it\u2019s going to be difficult because we have to distinguish between the two. And what I was wanting to do and what I want to do again here is appeal to the American public to recognize they can really help, like they did with mitigation, which they really helped. I need them to help now to best prepare us by getting the flu vaccine and taking flu out of the picture. Q But that quote \u2014 but that quote \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And you may not even have corona coming back, just so you understand. Doctor, would you like to explain that. Q No, but \u2014 but, I\u2019m sorry, but that quote that I just read was accurate \u2014 right, sir? Because that\u2019s the quote from the Washington Post. You were accurately quoted, correct? DR. REDFIELD: I\u2019m accurately quoted in the Washington Post as \u201cdifficult.\u201d But the headline was inappropriate. THE PRESIDENT: What does the headline say? What does the headline say? Go ahead, read the headline. Q The headline says, \u201cCDC Director Warns Second Wave of Coronavirus is Likely to be Even More Devastating.\u201d And isn\u2019t that correct? Because \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s not what he says. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not what he said. THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not what he said. Q But if you have the two things happening \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: The headline doesn\u2019t correspond to the story. DR. REDFIELD: No. I actually think it\u2019s actually going to be \u2014 I think the American public is going to heed the request to relook at their vaccine hesitancy, to vaccine with confidence for flu. And I\u2019m confident that the public health infrastructure that we\u2019re putting together now across this country so that we can early-case diagnose, isolate, and contact trace \u2014 as I say, block and tackle, block and tackle \u2014 that system is going to be there, and we\u2019re going to be able to contain this virus. Q Why did you retweet the article if it was inaccurate? Doctor, why did you retweet it? THE PRESIDENT: You weren\u2019t called. DR. BIRX: So, I just \u2014 we talked about this yesterday when you asked me this question. And someone, I think, used the word \u201cdevastating.\u201d And I want to really, again, emphasize to the American public that when we first interacted with this virus for the first time in the February and March timeframe, we didn\u2019t have an understanding of its transmissibility, all of its symptoms. We do now. And I think what we are building together, and the \u2014 when we talk about the public health infrastructure, it is very much working on the surveillance piece. But I think we also know the strength of the American people and their ability to immediately understand how to protect themselves with not touching their face, making sure that they\u2019re washing their hands. But the other piece I wanted just to talk about, and we mentioned yesterday also: that we have the summer \u2014 while we have flu surveillance that we can utilize and syndromic management that we can utilize \u2014 we have all of that time to prepare clearly the testing algorithm that you would need in a flu, potentially, if COVID came back. Potentially. And so we are preparing for that potential right now. And I think we spoke to you all about that and talked about how we\u2019re not only preparing for today and tomorrow, but we\u2019re preparing for six months from now, three months from now, and making sure that all of these pieces are in place. I think what Dr. Redfield clearly was asking for \u2014 just like we asked for every American to follow the guidelines, he\u2019s saying: Please add to that guidelines getting your flu shot and making sure you\u2019re protected. THE PRESIDENT: And, Doctor, wouldn\u2019t you say there\u2019s a good chance that COVID will not come back? DR. BIRX: We don\u2019t know \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And if it does comes back, it\u2019s in a very small, confined area that we put out. Go ahead. DR. BIRX: Well, the great thing is we\u2019ll be able to find it earlier this time. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ll find those cases earlier. So what Dr. Redfield said: We would be able to stay in containment phase. And what we\u2019re also hoping \u2014 and we talked about this about four or five weeks ago \u2014 that we\u2019re hoping that the flu infections also go down because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves. We want you to get your vaccine, but we also want to also protect individuals from getting the flu because of the vulnerability, we know, in certain populations to flu and the devastating outcomes to flu. We could prevent and decrease both of those things. So I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if, potentially, the virus comes back. THE PRESIDENT: And if it comes back, though, it won\u2019t be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. But what the doctor was saying \u2014 and I spoke to him a great length \u2014 he was saying, if it should come back \u201ctogether.\u201d Now you have a flu and you have the embers of corona. But, in my opinion, from everything I\u2019ve seen, it can never be like anything that we\u2019ve witnessed right now. Would you say that\u2019s a correct statement? DR. REDFIELD: Absolutely. I think \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s nothing like what we\u2019re talking \u2014 what we\u2019ve just gone though, we will not go through. You could have some embers of corona, and you could have a big flu system. And if they combine, if they come together \u2014 if they come together, it\u2019s not great. But we will not go through what we went through for the last two months. Yeah, Jeff. Q Mr. President, I \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Is that a correct statement? DR. REDFIELD: Correct. Q I understand that the United States will certainly be more prepared in the fall, but how can you say that you know it won\u2019t come back in the same level that it has today? THE PRESIDENT: What \u2014 it is estimated it might not come back at all, Jeff. It may not come back at all. Q But how \u2014 how can you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s talking about a worst-case scenario where you have a big flu and you have some corona. And if it does come back, it\u2019s not going to come back \u2014 and I\u2019ve spoken to 10 different people \u2014 it\u2019s not going to be like it was. Also, we have much better containment now. Before, nobody knew about it. Nobody knew anything about it. We understand it. Now, if we have pockets \u2014 a little pocket here or there \u2014 we\u2019re going to have to put out. It goes out and it\u2019s going to go out fast. We\u2019re going to be watching for it. But it\u2019s all possible. It\u2019s also possible it doesn\u2019t come back at all. Q I understand the containment, but I don\u2019t understand how you know it won\u2019t come back on a big scale. THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s not. I said if it does, it\u2019s not going to come back on anything near what we went through. But you could have a mess, where they come at the same time. And if they come at the same time \u2014 the flu is not the greatest thing in the world, Jeff. It\u2019s not the greatest thing either. If they come at the same time, you have them both. But if we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that\u2019s not going to be pleasant, but it\u2019s not going to be what we\u2019ve gone through in any way, shape, or form. Yeah. Q If you don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to come back at the same severity it is right now, why are you still directing that taxpayer dollars be spent on emergency procurement of ventilators? Tens of thousands of \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Because we have to have them for other reasons. Something else could come. I mean, we didn\u2019t know about corona; now we know about corona. But look at what happened. And now, we did have the H1N1 swine flu. We had that. We have other things that have happened. We had various forms of flu, but nothing like what we\u2019ve had here. Nothing at all like what we\u2019ve had here with the virus. But something could happen. I think that the stockpiles \u2014 we\u2019re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators right now. Nobody writes about that. You know, at the one time, all they talked about was ventilators, right? Because you didn\u2019t think it was possible for me to solve that problem. And I solved it and nobody can believe it. I just spoke to world leaders today who desperately need ventilators. They said, \u201cThe job you\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d And we\u2019re sending 500 to Mexico, then another 500 to France. We\u2019re sending some to Spain. We\u2019re sending some to Italy. We have them \u2014 they\u2019re being made by the thousands. And world leaders \u2014 I spoke to Prime Minister \u2014 I mean, I went through a lot of different calls today. I won\u2019t even tell you. But I went through \u2014 I can give you a list if you want \u2014 but I went through a lot of calls to a lot of leaders. Spoke with Pakistan; they would like to have some ventilators. We\u2019re going to get them some ventilators. But they all said to me one thing: It was incredible that you solved the ventilator problem because that was a big problem. The testing problem. We\u2019ve done more than any other nation in the world. Go a step further: If you added up the testing of every nation in the world, put them together, we\u2019ve done substantially more than that. You people aren\u2019t satisfied. So let\u2019s say we had 350 million people in the United States, right? Let\u2019s say. And if we gave every one of those people a test 10 times \u2014 so we give 350 people a test 10 times \u2014 the fake news media would say, \u201cWhere\u2019s the 11th time? He didn\u2019t do his job. Trump didn\u2019t do his job.\u201d Because you have a lot of bad reporting out there. It\u2019s very sad. And it\u2019s so bad \u2014 Q But that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s not true. That wouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: But you\u2019re one of \u2014 you\u2019re one of the leaders of the bad reporting. You know? Q No, but that\u2019s not true. I mean, this is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Okay, let\u2019s get onto another subject. I wanted that to be \u2014 Q Mr. President, can I just follow up on this real quick? THE PRESIDENT: I wanted that to be cleared up. If you want, we can get on to it later, but I want the Vice President to speak. But you ought to get the news accurately. You ought to write it \u2014 if you \u2014 if you take a look at what you wrote about the ventilators \u2014 and when we became the king of ventilators \u2014 we\u2019re making different factories all over. Ventilators by the thousands. In fact, Mike got back from Wisconsin. The first thing he did, he called up. I said, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe.\u201d He just saw a plant, a factory where they\u2019re making ventilators. I think I can say, the words were \u201cunbelievable.\u201d He said it was unbelievable what he saw \u2014 the quality of the equipment, the professionalism. THE VICE PRESIDENT: They doubled production. THE PRESIDENT: A tremendous number of \u2014 how many workers would you say were there? THE VICE PRESIDENT: It was over 550. They doubled production and are about to triple production. THE PRESIDENT: Nobody thought this could be done. The fake news was very unhappy that it was done. But you guys don\u2019t ask me about ventilators anymore. Q Well, who\u2019s unhappy \u2014 who\u2019s unhappy that ventilators are being made, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: Everybody. Everybody. Because you never mention it. You never mention it. There\u2019s no story that\u2019s what a great job we\u2019ve done with ventilators. We\u2019re now supplying ventilators all over the world. Because no other country could have done what we did. And you should say that\u2019s a great story. Instead you say, \u201cTrump was slow\u201d or \u2014 slow? We were so fast. Plus, we put the ban on so much earlier. When Nancy Pelosi, as an example \u2014 you don\u2019t say this \u2014 when she\u2019s having her rally in San Francisco \u2014 in Chinatown, in San Francisco. Nobody wants to say that. If we didn\u2019t \u2014 and Dr. Fauci said this \u2014 if we didn\u2019t close our country to China, we would have been so infected, like nobody\u2019s ever seen. When you saw the chart \u2014 and we were at the top of the list, in terms of success \u2014 nobody wrote it. I said, \u201cWhere \u2014 is anybody going to use that chart?\u201d Nobody wrote it. In terms of mortality. You saw that. Nobody wrote it. Germany and our country: the most successful, in terms of mortality. Nobody wrote it. It would be great if you wrote the truth, but let\u2019s get on with it because I want Mike to speak. And then we\u2019ll take some more questions, on the assumption you\u2019d like to and I think you probably will. It\u2019s been encouraging to watch states begin to open up as \u2014 and it really has been; it\u2019s a beautiful thing to see \u2014 as restrictions are lifted. We must maintain vigilance and continue practicing social distancing. I encourage governors to follow a careful, phased approach. And I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines. Very important. The governors are going to adhere, hopefully, or they\u2019re going to do what they think is best. I want them to do what they think is best, but ideally they\u2019ll adhere. Wash your hands, avoid close physical contact as much as possible, and wear a face covering when distancing is impractical. There were cases. We\u2019ve flattened the curve and really made tremendous progress, but we must guard against a dangerous rebound. We don\u2019t want to rebound. That\u2019s so important. This is what we were just talking about. We don\u2019t want a rebound. The doctor doesn\u2019t want to rebound. These people definitely don\u2019t want to rebound. I don\u2019t think you want one, do you, huh? You especially. We don\u2019t want to rebounds after all this death \u2014 death \u2014 that we\u2019ve suffered. Not work \u2014 I don\u2019t view it \u201cwork\u201d; I view it \u201cdeath\u201d that was unnecessary. It should have never happened. It should have never left that little area where it started. You know it and I know it and they know it. In our all-out war against the virus, we continue to make great strides on testing. Famous testing. Doing more than anybody else anywhere in the world. Nothing funny about that, Jon. Most of the governors have never faced a situation like this before, but we\u2019re helping them find unused testing capacity within their states \u2014 tremendous testing capacity that the governors, in many cases, didn\u2019t know they had. And additional capabilities are coming on line every day. We\u2019re coming up with new equipment, like the Abbott Laboratories equipment \u2014 on site, five minutes. Great success. Everybody wants it. But you can only make so many of those machines, so we have many other forms of testing. We have many other machines that do it very quickly and by the millions \u2014 by the millions. Our task force issued its reopening guidelines earlier than April 30th to give governors the time that they needed to develop testing capability and capacity and customized plans for their states, which many of them did. We\u2019ve had some governors do a fantastic job on testing and on a lot of other things. I spoke \u2014 as you know, Governor Cuomo was here. He had a \u2014 we had a great conversation on testing yesterday, and they\u2019re doing a really good job in New York. We\u2019re working very closely with each of the states to help them succeed. I spoke earlier today with Governor Newsom, California. And that was all about testing, that conversation. He has been scaling up really well. Really good job. And I agreed to help him get some of the critical supplies that California needs to make use of the tremendous capacity that they\u2019ve found. This is a tremendous testing capacity. And I\u2019m going to do it very quickly. He needs certain things. I\u2019m going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to get that to him very quickly. Now, could he get it himself? Yes. But I can get it faster. He understands that. And he\u2019s done a great job. And we\u2019re going to have it to him \u2014 we\u2019re going to have a lot of it to him over the next two days. And we\u2019re going to beef it up the following week, get him a lot of additional. He\u2019s done a really terrific job in California. Some of the governors have done a fantastic job, working with us. I told the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia. They\u2019re incredible people. I love those people. They are \u2014 they\u2019re great. They\u2019ve been strong, resolute. But, at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right. I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he\u2019s doing. But I want to let the governors do \u2014 now, if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I\u2019ll do. But I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barbershops in phase one \u2014 we\u2019re going to have phase two very soon \u2014 is just too soon. I think it\u2019s too soon. And I love the people. I love \u2014 I love those people that use all of those things: the spas and the beauty parlors and barbershops, tattoo parlors. I love them. But they can wait a little bit longer. Just a little bit. Not \u2014 not much. Because safety has to predominate. We have to have that. So I told the governor, very simply, that I disagree with his decision, but he has to do what he thinks is right. I\u2019m excited to announce that, in the coming weeks, the Air Force Thunderbirds \u2014 they\u2019re incredible \u2014 and the Navy Blue Angels \u2014 equally incredible \u2014 will be performing air shows over America\u2019s major cities and some of the cities that aren\u2019t major cities. They\u2019re going to be doing a lot of work \u2014 a lot of very dangerous flying. It\u2019s dangerous, you know \u2014 the odds when you start going at massive speeds and you\u2019re 18 inches away from each other. That\u2019s dangerous work. Your son is a great pilot. And I don\u2019t know if he could be \u2014 could he be a \u2014 could he be a Thunderbird? I don\u2019t know. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ll see. THE PRESIDENT: I think \u2014 I think he probably could, from what I hear. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want him to be, because it is \u2014 it\u2019s incredible what they\u2019re able to do. And to sacrifice our frontline \u2014 what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re paying tribute to our frontline healthcare workers confronting COVID. And it\u2019s really a signal to all Americans to remain vigilant during the outbreak. This is a \u2014 a tribute to them, to our warriors. Because they are equal warriors to those incredible pilots and all of the fighters that we have for the more traditional fights that we win. And we win. If we want to win, we always win. Sometimes we don\u2019t want to win, so we just go to a standstill. But that\u2019s always \u2014 that\u2019s not the way this country works. Operation America Strong was the idea of our great military men and women \u2014 the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels crews who wanted to show support to the American medical workers who, just like military members in a time of war, are fiercely running torward the fight. It\u2019s going to be great. I want to see those shows. I\u2019ve seen them many times and I can\u2019t get enough of them. And on July 4th, we\u2019ll be doing what we had at the Mall, as you know. We\u2019re going to be doing it. Last year was a tremendous success and I would imagine we\u2019ll do it \u2014 hopefully, I can use the term \u201cforever.\u201d That was a great success as you remember, even though it was pouring. It was raining so hard. It was raining at \u2014 that was about as hard as I\u2019ve seen in a while, but it was an amazing success. Didn\u2019t bother the pilots. It didn\u2019t bother the military. It didn\u2019t bother the crews that we had there. So we\u2019re going to be doing that again on July 4th. Our great military is operating at 100 percent during this crisis and thousands of troops are deployed alongside of civilians in the COVID hotspots, as you know. You see them all over. I spoke \u2014 when I spoke with Governor Cuomo, and when I spoke to Gavin Newsom, and many of the other governors, they wanted to know if we could have some military help with the medical, and we \u2014 we gave it to them. And in every case, they said, \u201cFantastic.\u201d I mean, just fantastic. In New York City, Mayor de Blasio called me to say it was inspiring to watch. He was there when the military came in. He said it gave everybody spirit when he saw the professionalism and the spirit that they had. They walked in and they helped a lot of \u2014 a lot of people: doctors, nurses, respiratory technicians, and professionals. It was an incredible thing. But they all \u2014 everybody that saw them going to work said that was something special. So we\u2019re going to have some tremendous air shows all throughout our country. And that\u2019s in honor of what we\u2019re all going through together, and the people that are helping us so much, and, unfortunately, the people who have passed away from something that should never have been allowed to happen. Following around-the-clock negotiations yesterday, the Senate answered my call to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program so that millions of additional American workers can keep getting a paycheck. We just increased it by $310 billion dollars. I urged the House to pass the bill without delay. In our first round of funding, we\u2019ve provided nearly $350 billion dollars, and it went at record speed to American workers and small businesses. And it\u2019s really been an incredible, incredible success. I want to thank the banks. We have the big banks, the little banks, the commercial banks of all kinds. We had the community banks \u2014 who were fantastic, by the way. Community banks. And as you know \u2014 this was an interesting story in recent days \u2014 I\u2019ve called for Harvard \u2014 that\u2019s Harvard University, which has a $40 billion endowment fund \u2014 to return the money that it was allocated under the CARES Act. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds, nor will Stanford University or many of the others that were involved both on a university level. Also on company level, some of the companies were bigger than people had represented or bigger than people had thought and strong enough that they didn\u2019t need the money. So there\u2019s a certain amount of money that we are not sending. As soon as I heard it, I said, \u201cStop funds.\u201d And for the most part, I guess, they stopped it, Mike, right? They stopped it. But we\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not accepting the money, and that\u2019s great. And so I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford, and I want to thank the other companies in the case. It\u2019s broken differently between colleges and companies, but I want to thank the companies and the other great universities. And there\u2019s some great ones. The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday also reserves $30 billion in loans for small financial institutions that serve minority and distressed communities. This is very important. We\u2019re determined to protect our African American, Hispanic American, and minority workers who have been hit so hard by this hidden enemy. My administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to address the full spectrum of needs in these communities, supporting both health and economic revitalization. First, my administration is committed to providing the testing that is needed to fight the virus in distressed communities. In the last month alone, we\u2019ve already sent over $1.4 billion to our nation\u2019s 13,000 community healthcare centers \u2014 think of that, 13,000 \u2014 to increase testing and treatment in the underserved areas. We\u2019re also expanding access to telehealth. Telehealth has become a big deal. You know, I\u2019ve been reading about it for years, and all of a sudden, because of this, it\u2019s become a big \u2014 a big thing. People can\u2019t leave their houses. They didn\u2019t want to leave their houses for various reasons, including they wanted to follow the guidelines. The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday \u2014 and I want to thank everybody. A great, great vote. Great. It\u2019s \u2014 as you know, it was a unanimous vote. How often do you see that? But the legislation passed by the Senate yesterday includes an additional $25 billion to further expand testing, and provides even more funding for community health centers and various forms of epidemics and pandemics. And we\u2019ll be working on that because, you know, as per a couple of your statements and questions before, we want to work on that for the future. We hope this doesn\u2019t happen again for \u2014 again, ever. But, you know, last time it was of this magnitude: 1917. That\u2019s a long time ago. So we want to be prepared. And we are prepared. And, as I told you, we\u2019re building up hospital \u2014 not only our stockpile, which is being up greatly \u2014 being built up greatly \u2014 but also hospital stockpiles. We\u2019re getting them what they need. We\u2019re working out cost arrangements with them. And we\u2019re getting them a lot of the ventilators, which are the hardest thing for them to get, both from a cost standpoint and a technical standpoint. At the same time, we\u2019re also supporting the establishment of new testing sites focused on these communities. Forty sites have launched so far, and there are plans to launch dozens more in the next three weeks. We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re coming up with testing apparatus and testing plans that are incredible when you look at the numbers. And some people are very, very big on testing. I\u2019m big on testing, but some people are much less big than I am, I will tell you, and they\u2019re professionals. But we want to have it so that nobody can talk about, \u201cGee whiz, I wish we had more testing.\u201d Nobody has done it like we\u2019ve done it, and nobody will. And we\u2019re getting very much stronger. We have incredible professionals doing it. So many different tests have now evolved, people are finding it even hard to believe. My administration is working closely with governors to ensure that they have the testing infrastructure in place to reduce further spread of the virus if they\u2019re so inclined to use the testing apparatus, including strategies for older individuals, low-income Americans, minorities, and Native Americans. As part of the effort, the White House Task Force, headed up by Mike, who has done incredible \u2014 I\u2019ll say it every time. I\u2019ll say it to anybody that wants to listen: Mike Pence has done an incredible job. Really, an incredible job. Thank you. Is providing technical assistance to all 50 states through one-on-one phone calls as they develop and implement their plans. In addition, my administration is committed to restoring black and Hispanic communities to full economic health. They want to be healthy, economically and physically, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. To that end, today I\u2019m directing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, led by Secretary Ben Carson, to focus its effort on supporting underserved communities impacted by the coronavirus. And so Ben Carson is working on that with Mike and myself and a lot of other people. I\u2019m going to ask Tim Scott, who was so helpful with the Opportunity Zones. That\u2019s an economic answer to a lot of problems. And Tim Scott was fantastic, and so I\u2019m going to ask him to get involved with you. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be willing to do it from South Carolina. I also asked the council to identify what additional funding will be required from Congress beyond what has already been provided. We\u2019re really building ourself a strong base and we\u2019re building ourself a wall that\u2019s very different from the kind of walls that you\u2019ve been hearing me talking about. But it nevertheless, in many ways, performs the same function. And hopefully it\u2019s going to perform it equally as well. Furthermore, the council will seek input from the private sector and community leaders on how we can best support minority and distressed communities. As President, I\u2019m absolutely determined to deliver a great future for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Before our nation was attacked by this horrible enemy, our African American and Hispanic American citizens were prospering like never before. Best employment numbers ever. Not only African American, Asian American, Hispanic American \u2014 every American. We were breaking records at every level. We had almost 160 million people employed. We were never even close to that number. And we\u2019re also breaking them economically \u2014 highest stock market numbers, highest numbers of every kind. And I think we\u2019re going to be back there, and I think it\u2019s going to be much sooner rather than later. And I think we\u2019ll surpass those numbers, including our employment numbers. But I\u2019ll not rest until that prosperity has been fully restored. And, again, I really believe that we\u2019re going to lift those numbers higher than ever before. And it won\u2019t be as long as people might think. A lot of very smart people are looking at that and they\u2019re betting. You just have to look at what\u2019s going on with the stock market. In order to protect our great American workers, I\u2019ve just signed an executive order temporarily suspending immigration into the United States. This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens. Crucially, it will also preserve our healthcare resources for American patients. We have to take care of our patients, we have to take care of our great American workers, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So I\u2019ve just signed it, just before coming into the room. And very important, very important. And as to amending it or extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time. But it\u2019s now signed. Earlier today, the First Lady and I planted a tree on the South Lawn of the White House in recognition of the 50th annual Earth Day. I was glad to announce that we will begin to reopen our national parks and public lands. We want Americans to be able to satisfy and be really safe. We want them to satisfy their family that safety is going to happen. And it will happen, and maybe even at a level like never before. We\u2019ve learned so much. But we want them to enjoy these great national treasures as we continue to take reasonable precautions. And hopefully, it\u2019ll be just reasonable. My administration has directed more than $7 billion in federal funding to support the development of treatments, diagnostics, and therapies. And that\u2019s something, Doctors, I hope you can really work on. It\u2019s something so powerful and so important. The FDA, the NIH, and industry leaders are establishing master clinical trial protocols to test multiple promising new drugs at the same time. And they\u2019re doing a lot of \u2014 we\u2019re doing a lot of testing right now. More than 1,600 locations across the country have signed up to administer convalescent plasma to patients, infusing them with antibodies of those who have recovered. And when they recover \u2014 I said it last time \u2014 practically, the first thing they say is, \u201cI want to give my blood so that I can help other people.\u201d They want to give their blood. It\u2019s incredible. They\u2019re laying in bed, they\u2019re still in pretty weakened conditions, and they say, \u201cI want to give my blood.\u201d And that\u2019s happening all the time, isn\u2019t it? If you recovered from the coronavirus, I ask you to consider contacting your local blood or plasma donation center to arrange a donation that could potentially save many lives. With love for our nation and loyalty for our fellow citizens, we will safeguard our families, care for our neighbors, heal the sick, protect our workers, and build a future for a country that is the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we\u2019re only going to get greater. Thank you very much. Mike Pence, please. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today and, despite the fact that there have been more than 843,000 Americans who contracted the coronavirus and we grieve the loss of more than 47,000 of our countrymen, according to Dr. Birx and her team, we continue to see encouraging signs because the American people have been putting into practice the guidance that\u2019s been issued by the President and this task force and they\u2019ve been taking to heart the guidance of state and local officials. And, Mr. President, as we learned today, we are continuing to see declines in all the major metro areas around the country that have been most impacted. Numbers remain low and steady on the West Coast \u2014 in Washington State and in California. The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut all appear to be past their peak. And as \u2014 as our scientists may reflect in a few moments, we also are seeing the positive rate going down, which is actually even as encouraging as the declining cases. The Detroit metro area appears to be past its peak. The Seattle metro area, as I mentioned, remain stable. The New Orleans metro area is the most stable of all the large metro outbreaks. We also are continuing to see a stabilization and even declines in \u2014 in Houston and Atlanta and Nashville and Baltimore and Indianapolis and elsewhere. This is a tribute to the American people, to the fact that the American people have taken to heart the guidelines \u2014 the social distancing; the personal hygiene; the recommendation that you use the drive-through at a restaurant, rather than going in a restaurant; and avoiding groups of more than 10. On the President\u2019s behalf, on behalf of our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, we just want to urge all of the American people to continue onward. We all want to reopen America. And we want to reopen our states and our communities as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so. But I want to say to my countrymen: the fastest way to reopen America is to continue to do what you\u2019ve been doing. That\u2019s the fastest way, as President Trump has said many times, to get our country working again \u2014 is to put the coronavirus in the past. And we are on our way to doing just that. You know, from early on, the President called forth not only the full power of the federal government, but he called forth the full weight of the American economy. And I had the privilege yesterday to travel to Madison, Wisconsin, and see American industry and American workers at their very best. And I want to thank the GE Healthcare team in Wisconsin, as well as the union machinists that I spent time with all day yesterday. It was extraordinary, Mr. President. And earlier this month, you used the Defense Production Act to ensure that supplies could flow to GE and General Motors and Ford and other companies that \u2014 that were prepared to repurpose manufacturing lines and hire new workers to construct ventilators. And, at this particular plant, they literally have \u2014 the union sat down \u2014 the machinists\u2019 union sat down and, in less than one week, negotiated a new contract with GE Healthcare that allowed them to begin to bring in workers from around the country. They doubled \u2014 they doubled their \u2014 their work line in one week. They\u2019re about to triple it. They\u2019ve been going 24 hours a day, 3 shifts, 7 days a week. And the President promised that, by harnessing the power of the American economy, we would have 100,000 ventilators in 100 days. But thanks to the ingenuity and the hardworking Americans that I was with yesterday and other companies, we\u2019re actually going to have 110,000 ventilators in 100 days. They were all wearing t-shirts, Mr. President \u2014 I brought one back for you \u2014 that simply read, \u201cUnion Machinists Save Lives.\u201d And to that great team of GE Healthcare, I want to just say all of America is proud of you and grateful for you. We\u2019re also grateful to all of our healthcare workers at every level and all the work that they\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re proud that our National Guard and our American military are at their side. As our task force learned today, more than 31,000 National Guard stood up around the country. And the President, in the last day, extended what\u2019s called Title 32 authorizations for all National Guard personnel through May 31. So we\u2019re going to continue to partner with states, as the National Guard plays a vital role in testing, and in cleaning nursing homes, and in standing up states\u2019 response. Military personnel: Mr. President, we have more than 5,500 active duty military personnel, including, as of yesterday, 964 medical professionals in the uniform of the United States, working in 17 hospitals in 7 states around the country. We\u2019re also very proud of our team at the VA. The VA has \u2014 has addressed its capacity issues. It\u2019s not seeing cases among the veterans in its facilities increase, so they\u2019re deploying teams to focus on nursing homes. In Massachusetts, the VA personnel have disinfected two different nursing homes in New Jersey. They\u2019ve literally taken over two state nursing homes and deployed 90 doctors and nurses. And, in Florida, we\u2019re sending 16 teams to assist in nursing home operations. As the President also mentioned, in addition to what I saw yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to \u2014 we continue to build our Strategic National Stockpile. It\u2019s growing, again, with ventilators \u2014 nearly 11,000 in supply. Nine hundred and one new ventilators will be added, transitioned in the near term. And every American, I think, can \u2014 can be confident that, should the need arise for your family member, facing serious consequences from the coronavirus to need that equipment to help them breathe, that equipment will be there. As we said yesterday in Wisconsin and you\u2019ve said, Mr. President, I think it should be a great source of comfort to every American that no American who has required a ventilator in the United States has been denied a ventilator. And that\u2019s a testament to our healthcare workers, it\u2019s a testament to every American putting mitigation principles into practice, and it\u2019s a testament to all these great companies. Speaking of great companies, American businesses are stepping up. It was on April 1st that I traveled to Walmart distribution center and the President reached out to the \u2014 to the president and CEO of Walmart to ask Walmart to get in the gowns business. And, Mr. President, I\u2019m glad to report to you that we heard today at the task force that Walmart is producing 8.4 million gowns, and they will be delivered into our commercial supply to healthcare facilities around the country by the end of June. They\u2019re hardly alone. Honda is producing 500,000 face shields. New Balance is making 100,000 masks a week. In a very real sense, the American people have stepped up to make the sacrifices and endure the hardship that social distancing has required, but American businesses, at every size and every means, have come together to respond to the President\u2019s call. It really has been a whole-of-America approach. And our message from the President\u2019s White House Coronavirus Task Force is to tell the American people it\u2019s working. We\u2019re getting there. We can see light at the end of the tunnel. We can see the day that we can reopen and put America back to work. But it\u2019s going to take all of us, continuing to make the sacrifices necessary to practice those disciplines, to get us to a place where we can reopen safely and confidently. And with that, Mr. President, I\u2019ll call Dr. Fauci up for his reflections and \u2014 and we\u2019ll move on. THE PRESIDENT: Great. DR. FAUCI: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. So I\u2019m going to just take off from when I was at this podium a few days ago, to kind of reiterate some of the things that the Vice President said, but to kind of connect the dots from where we were, where we are now, and where I think we\u2019re going to be. So, you remember a couple of weeks ago, when we talked about the fact that we were going to have a really bad week because the deaths, particularly driven by the situation in New York, were going to get worse and worse. But yet, as that was happening, we were starting to see some turnaround, some flattening, and some coming down. As you\u2019ve heard from Dr. Birx and will likely hear more, that that is continuing. So what has happened is that the mitigation that we put in with the first 15 days and then the 30-day mitigation program of physical distancing worked. So it got us to where we are today. It is a successful formula. It is the basis for our being able to say that we can now think seriously about reopening America. And for that reason, we put together a carefully thought out and, I believe, well-delineated and described program for Opening Up America Again. And you know what it is; it\u2019s the guidelines that we announced a few days ago. Those very guidelines are based on a version of the successful formula that got us to where we are. So what I\u2019m trying to say is that the program is not one that is going to be: \u201cTurn the lights on in America. We\u2019re finished.\u201d We\u2019re not. We have to proceed in a very careful, measured way. And if you look at the guidelines, they are careful and they are measured. There are certain checkpoints before you can even think about going into a phase one, and then things relax a little as you go into phase two, and relax a little and you go into phase three. Now, we live in a big country and it\u2019s heterogeneous, and there are different dynamics of outbreaks in different parts of the country. So the speed with which one can go from one to another, at the point at which you can even begin to think about the phase, is going to differ. So the one thing that I know: The urge we all have to get out there and get it over with \u2014 let\u2019s get back to normal \u2014 for a lot of good reasons because there\u2019s a lot of suffering, economic and otherwise, in this country because of that. But again, as I\u2019ve pleaded early on, weeks ago, I plead with the American public, with the governors, with the mayors, for the people with responsibility: Although I know one has the need to leapfrog over things, don\u2019t do that. Do it in a measured way. This is a successful formula. The problem is if we don\u2019t do that, there is a likelihood that we\u2019ll have a rebound. And the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we can\u2019t take care of. So, please, again, let me just close by pleading with the American public in general and those who are responsible leaders to carefully consider how we get back to normal. Thank you. Q Dr. Fauci, could you talk a little about your expectations for the fall? We heard from Dr. Redfield and Dr. Birx. What do you see for the fall? Is it going to be embers or possibly no return of the virus at all? DR. FAUCI: You know, as I\u2019ve said before here, when you look at an outbreak, it\u2019s two dynamic forces opposing each other. If you leave the virus to its own devices, it will take off if you do nothing to stop it. If you put into place the kinds of things that we talk about, first, containment \u2014 and then hopefully you never get to mitigation \u2014 but containment is important. Those two forces are going to determine whether you\u2019re going to have a big outbreak. So, what Dr. Redfield was saying, first of all, is that we will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that because of the degree of \u2014 of transmissibility that it has, the global nature. What happens with that will depend on how we\u2019re able to contain it when it occurs. And what we\u2019re saying is that, in the fall, we will be much, much better prepared to do the kind of containment compared to what happened to us this winter. Now, the complicating issue is that, unlike the syndromic and influenza-like observances that we have, that you could pick it up by clinically what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s going to get complicated by influenza season. And I believe that\u2019s what Dr. Redfield was saying, that it is going to be complicated. So whether or not it\u2019s going to be big or small is going to depend on our response. And \u2014 and that\u2019s what I think people sometimes have misunderstanding. Nobody can predict what is going to happen with an outbreak, but you can predict how you\u2019re going to respond to it. And that\u2019s really very important. Q So you would caution against people thinking that, in the fall, there\u2019s not going to be coronavirus anymore and we won\u2019t have to worry about it? DR. FAUCI: No. No. Q Or if it is, it\u2019ll be spotty and it won\u2019t be a big problem we have to worry about? DR. FAUCI: No. There will be coronavirus in the fall. If we do \u2014 which we won\u2019t, but let\u2019s take an imaginary period. We say, \u201cOkay, coronavirus, forget about it. We\u2019re not going to do anything about it.\u201d It will take off. That\u2019s what viruses do, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re going to respond to it to not allow it to do that. Q Dr. Fauci, what happens when governors like Governor Kemp are not following this careful, measured plan and moving forward even without meeting the gating criteria? What do you do about that? DR. FAUCI: Well \u2014 well, you know, if I were advising the governor, I would tell him that he should be careful. And I would advise him not to just turn the switch on and go. Because there is a danger of a rebound. And I know there\u2019s the desire to move ahead quickly \u2014 that\u2019s a natural, human nature desire \u2014 but going ahead and leapfrogging into phases where you should not be, I would advise him, as a health official and as a physician, not to do that. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Go ahead, please. Q Thank you, Mr. President. Can you please give some details about the executive order? I know that the White House has just released a document. I haven\u2019t had a chance to review it. THE PRESIDENT: Well, we could talk about that later. It\u2019s an executive order on immigration. We want Americans to have the jobs. We want Americans to have the healthcare. We want to take care of our citizens first. We have to. And it\u2019s a very powerful order. It\u2019s for 60 days. At the end of 60 days, or maybe even during 60 days, I\u2019ll extend it or not. And I\u2019ll maybe change it. I might modify it. Yes. Q (Inaudible) for immigrants who are already here, Mr. President? Q Mr. President, I wanted to ask you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, go ahead, please. Q Immigrants who are already here in the country or immigrants abroad who already effectively have a green card, trying to get into the country, and healthcare workers? THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re talking about immigrants that are trying to get in, and we\u2019re talking about people and \u2014 also, by the way, people that are coming in illegally. Now, as you know, because you\u2019ve seen the numbers, our border \u2014 our southern border \u2014 is very, very tight. It hasn\u2019t been this tight in years. It\u2019s being helped by 160 \u2014 more than that \u2014 miles of wall that are going up. I\u2019m trying to get to 450 by the end of the year \u2014 450 miles. And we\u2019ll have 530 miles early next year, and that\u2019s really great. It\u2019s fully funded. We have all the funds. And the Army Corps of Engineers is doing a fantastic job. Same people that did Javits Center, as you know. They\u2019re doing a fantastic job. So our \u2014 our southern border is very, very tight, for good reason \u2014 for very good reason. We\u2019re also being helped by 27,000 very good soldiers from Mexico, and I want to thank the President of Mexico. He\u2019s been terrific in many ways, including on what we\u2019re doing with COVID. And, as you know, we have a very good trade arrangement with Mexico now, which we didn\u2019t have before. So I want to thank the President of Mexico, in particular for the 27,000 soldiers. Q Do you want to talk about the exemptions for the healthcare workers, sir? THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re doing \u2014 they\u2019re doing a fantastic job. Q Do you want to talk about the exemptions for healthcare workers? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we want to protect our healthcare workers, and that\u2019s one of the other reasons we\u2019re doing this. Yes, Jon. Q Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about Rick Bright. He\u2019s the head of the federal agency in charge of getting a vaccine out to \u2014 to Americans once it\u2019s ready. He says he has been pushed out of his job because he raised questions about hydroxychloroquine and some of your directives on that. Was he pushed out of that job? THE PRESIDENT: I \u2014 I\u2019ve never heard of him. You just mentioned the name. I never heard of him. When did this happen? Q This happened today. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019ve never heard of him. If the guy says he was pushed out of a job, maybe he was, maybe he wasn\u2019t. I \u2014 you\u2019d have to hear the other side. I don\u2019t know who he is. Please. Q And on the hydroxychloroquine \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Hold on one second, please. Q I just wanted to \u2014 you said by Fourth of July you expect people be on the National Mall and we\u2019ll be having a celebration like we did \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Hope so. Q \u2014 last year. Given what the doctors are just saying \u2014 that, you know, coronavirus is still going to be out there \u2014 might not be as bad as it is now, but it\u2019s still going to be circulating \u2014 is that \u2014 is that going to be safe to have that many people on the Mall for July Fourth? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re going to probably have 25 percent of what we had last year. Last year, as you know, it was maxed out \u2014 maxed out. I saw a magnificent picture of Dr. Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year, and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful. Very similar. This year, most likely, we\u2019ll be standing six feet apart. We\u2019ll have to do that in a very, very interesting way. And maybe we\u2019ll even do it greater, so we\u2019ll leave a little extra distance. But if we do that, we\u2019d certainly do that. I \u2014 I don\u2019t see, maybe, the purpose if we can\u2019t do that. We have to have people. Thousands \u2014 we had tens of thousands \u2014 most of you were there \u2014 tens of thousands of people last year. It was incredible. And it was, to an extent, an air show of all the different aircraft flying over. We even had Air Force One flying over. So ideally, it would be wonderful if we could actually have it as it was last year. But \u2014 and, eventually, we\u2019ll \u2014 we will have that. I think it\u2019s important to know: Eventually, we are going to have that. Your stadiums are going to be the way \u2014 Q You think by July you\u2019d be able to have \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 they\u2019ve been for the last hundred years. Q By July, you\u2019d be able to have a \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, I know. But your stadiums \u2014 as an example, sports \u2014 are going to be the way they used to be. I mean, I told one of the owners. He said, \u201cDo you think I should take out seats?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t take out seats.\u201d We\u2019re going to have it the way it was. We\u2019re going to be back. This virus will eventually be gone. And if it should show up in the fall, we\u2019re going to put it out very fast. We have great people. We\u2019re going to put it out very fast, because we\u2019ve learned a lot. We\u2019ve learned a lot about how to deal with this, and we\u2019ll put it out very fast. Yeah, please. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Nice \u2014 just nice and easy. Just \u2014 good. Q You talk a lot about testing capacity. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q And governors agree that that exists. But it\u2019s very different from testing implementation. And they are still begging for you to use your full authority to help them get reagents and other things. As you would like to say, what do you have to lose by helping them do that \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Well, I am doing that. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are doing that. Q \u2014 and becoming the king of testing? THE PRESIDENT: And \u2014 and let me just say, we are the king of testing already. There\u2019s no country in the world that\u2019s done more. Not even \u2014 not even close. Q Well, only 1.2 percent of the population has been tested. Is that good enough? THE PRESIDENT: I just said there\u2019s no country in the world that\u2019s done more. And we have tests that have already come out that are going to be introduced very shortly that will do it more. My problem is this: It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s very much of media trap. Whether we did 2 percent, 5 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent, it\u2019ll never be enough, no matter what. Q But it\u2019s 1.2 percent. THE PRESIDENT: Now, with the \u2014 with the expertise and with what we did \u2014 because of our expertise and tremendous talent at manufacturing \u2014 what we did with the ventilators, that wasn\u2019t a trap. Because we got them done, shockingly to everybody, because of the incredible talent \u2014 like Mike Pence saw yesterday in Wisconsin. But we have numerous of those sites all over the country doing the same thing. So that when the governors were complaining \u2014 some of the governors, I must say. And it was very much along party lines, for the most part, but when they \u2014 except for one. When the governors were complaining, we said, \u201cNo, no. How many do you need?\u201d \u201cWe need 50.\u201d \u201cWe need 100.\u201d One governor asked for many, many, many thousands, and it turned out they didn\u2019t need that, and that\u2019s good. We got them and nobody that needed a ventilator \u2014 you know this, and we went through this with the governors \u2014 that needed a ventilator didn\u2019t get a ventilator. That was an incredible achievement. With testing, it\u2019s a little different. It\u2019s much easier than ventilators. It\u2019s like 2 percent. But \u2014 for instance, the swabs are coming in by the millions. They\u2019re coming in \u2014 literally coming in by the millions. Totally ordered. We wanted the highest quality. We could have gotten a much lesser quality. We didn\u2019t want to do that. We got the highest quality. But, testing \u2014 it\u2019s like no matter how well you do, you can always say more. With the ventilators, they either have them or they don\u2019t. In fact, we went to one meeting \u2014 \u201cWho wants a ventilator?\u201d One governor \u2014 one governor said, \u201cWe\u2019d like 25.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five. You got them. Who else?\u201d Nobody spoke up. That was four weeks ago. So that was great. The problem with the testing is, as I said, if we test \u2014 if we tested 350 million people, you\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, we want them to have a second test or a third test or a fourth test.\u201d Not everybody believes as strongly as some people in testing. Some people want to do testing because they think it\u2019s impossible for us to fulfill that goal. That\u2019s easy compared to ventilators, as I\u2019ve said. But we have a tremendous testing capability \u2014 better than anybody in the world right now. And every day, it\u2019s growing. And it\u2019s growing very substantial. I mean, these doctors are very talented people. They\u2019ve seen testing all their lives. They\u2019ve never seen anything like we\u2019ve been able to do. So, we\u2019re going to give everybody what they want with the testing. But again, testing \u2014 and I\u2019ve said it from the beginning: The actual test has to be administered locally. You can\u2019t do from Washington or faraway locations \u2014 federal testing \u2014 nearly as well as you can, where you have a governor, he has mayors, and they have representatives, and \u2014 and they know the back of a Walmart \u2014 put it in the parking lot in the back of a Walmart or put it in a certain location in different states. They\u2019re doing it beautifully. It\u2019s working beautifully. The relationship I have with the governors, and Mike has, and we all have with the governors, I would say, other than one or two \u2014 but even them, they don\u2019t complain. They\u2019re not complaining. So we\u2019re doing tremendous testing. And ultimately, we\u2019re doing more testing, I think, than probably any of the governors even want. Okay. Please, Jennifer. Q Back on the immigration EO \u2014 can you say, is it just for green cards \u2014 for green card holders or is it \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s green cards for \u2014 subject \u2014 Q Is it also for people seeking temporary work visas? THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s subject to change. We have some people coming in, for instance, helping the farmers. We want to have the farmers take care \u2014 they\u2019ve been coming for years and years, and they\u2019re helping our farmers, and they\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve been coming in for years. We don\u2019t want to do \u2014 you know, the border has been turned off a number of times over the years. And you know what happened? Our farmers all went out of business. They were out of business. They couldn\u2019t farm. We\u2019re taking care of our farmers. Nobody ever took care of farmers like I take care of farmers. Q Subject to change because some \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Including the $19 billion that we\u2019re dispersing to farmers because of some very good things that happened. Q Subject to change because some of your advisors are saying there could be a problem with it, or subject to change because you want to extend it? THE PRESIDENT: No, no. Just it might be modified. It could be modified next week, in two weeks. It could be modified in two months. No, we may modify it as we go along. But right now, we have a very powerful immigration ban, but it could be modified \u2014 meaning made tougher or made less tough. We don\u2019t want to hurt our businesses, and we don\u2019t want to hurt our farmers. Very important. Q Mr. President, can I ask you about your conversation with Governor Kemp? What did he say to you when you said you strongly disagreed with him? And, of course, for gym owners and tattoo parlor artists and barbers in Atlanta \u2014 I mean, Georgia, generally \u2014 would you advise them to listen to you and not to their governor? THE PRESIDENT: Look, I\u2019d like them to listen to their governors. All of their governors. I have the right to do, if I wanted to clamp it down, but I have respect for our governors. They know what they\u2019re doing, I think. And, as you know, Brian Kemp, governor of Georgia, I worked very hard for his election. He beat their superstar. He beat the superstar of their party. I think you can say, I helped a lot. Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey \u2014 they all went in. They campaigned for him very, very hard, and he lost. He also was way down in a primary, and he ended up winning a primary after I came out and endorsed him. So, a lot of good things and there\u2019s a lot of good feeling between myself and Brian Kemp. I like him a lot. I happen to disagree with him only on time and timing. I disagree. When you have spas, beauty parlors \u2014 and I love these people \u2014 I know the people from spas and beauty parlors, tattoo parlors. Bikers for Trump \u2014 a lot of tattoos. I love them. I love these people. And barbershops. These are great people. But you know what? Maybe you wait a little bit longer until you get into a phase two. So do I agree with him? No. But I respect him, and I will let him make his decision. Would I do that? No. I\u2019d keep them a little longer. I want to protect people\u2019s lives. But I\u2019m going to let him make his decision. But I told him: I totally disagree. Okay. Q Thank you, Mr. President. The Vice President, in his remarks, was talking about the federal efforts that have been undertaken as it relates to nursing facilities. And, as you both know, they\u2019ve been just so incredibly hard hit \u2014 just tragic \u2014 over 10,000 COVID-19 deaths so far. The industry says that they\u2019re struggling as it relates to testing. Can you commit to increasing testing at the nursing facilities across the country? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Well, we\u2019re doing that automatically. I mean, that\u2019s almost common sense. But we\u2019re doing that automat- \u2014 I mean, you look at the State of Washington. That was our first glimpse of it. They got hit so horribly in that nursing home. It seems \u2014 it seemed like everybody was from a particular nursing home. So we knew immediately that was going to be a problem. And we\u2019re doing that, 100 percent. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I can speak to \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re taking very special care of our nursing homes and our seniors, other than me. Other than me. Nobody wants to take care of me. But other than me, we\u2019re taking care of our seniors. Q Another \u2014 another \u2014 THE VICE PRESIDENT: I can speak to that as well. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, please, Mike. Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. Vice President. THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, it\u2019s just an enormously important question. And we want to thank the American people who have been putting off visits to their grandmothers and grandfathers and moms and dads. It\u2019s tough. I\u2019m going to be in Indiana next week, and I\u2019m not going to go see my mom. She lives in her own home, but people get it that the risk of serious illness for a healthy American of the coronavirus is fairly low. You\u2019ll either have flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. But as we\u2019ve said so many times at this podium and the American people get it: A healthy American could inadvertently convey the coronavirus to a senior with an underlying health condition and have the kind of heartbreaking results that we\u2019ve seen in nursing homes around the country. It\u2019s the reason why, from early on, the President took decisive action to raise the infectious disease standards at every nursing home in America. He deployed all 8,000 of our inspectors at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to dedicate all of their time to ensuring compliance with those new higher standards. And we\u2019ve spoken about \u2014 about nursing home issues with governors around the country. And frankly, there are governors around the country that have done remarkable work with nursing homes. You mentioned Governor Brian Kemp. He actually used the National Guard. In Georgia, he deployed them to nursing homes to do cleaning and to disinfect areas of those nursing homes. And it\u2019s a tremendous service. But to your point about testing, if you look carefully at the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, you will see that in phase one, the level of testing that we contemplate is first that we want to be able to test anyone who has the symptoms that may be coronavirus, and be able to test them quickly. Secondly, we want to do the kind of contact tracing \u2014 and Dr. Redfield and his team are deploying CDC teams in every state in America \u2014 to be able to find out everyone that that person has been in contact with and test them. But if you look right underneath that, what we\u2019re directing states to do is be prepared to deploy testing resources first and foremost to nursing homes and long-term care facilities so that we can monitor any potential outbreak of the coronavirus among the most vulnerable population. Thanks to the leadership of our Surgeon General, as the President announced today, we\u2019re also going to be deploying testing resources to vulnerable communities, to underserved communities. The CDC released new preliminary data on the impact, particularly, on African American communities in this country. And it\u2019s the reason why part of our phase-one recommendation is that we deploy testing resources into those communities that are described by the doctors as socially vulnerable. And, even as we speak, we\u2019ll announce next week that we\u2019re already in the process of deploying testing. And so it\u2019s a good opportunity to remind every American to be especially careful around our seniors and to heed the guidance about avoiding visitations to protect the health of those who are most vulnerable. But the American people can be assured that from phase one forward, all the way through phase three and reopening, we\u2019re going to be helping to guide the states to focus on the most vulnerable, beginning with our seniors with serious underlying health conditions. Q Mr. Vice President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: How about right behind Jennifer? Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ll get back \u2014 we\u2019ll get back to you. Q Commercial labs say that they need to buy new diagnostic machines to be able to double their testing capacity. Your administration has said that there is enough testing capacity to double overnight. How do you, kind of, square that difference? THE PRESIDENT: Very easy. They can get new machines if they want, but even if they didn\u2019t, we have tremendous testing capability. You take a look at what\u2019s happening in California and New York. Governor Cuomo told us very strongly \u2014 he said, \u201cWow, we have a lot of labs.\u201d You know, that\u2019s a research center of the world. They have tremendous \u2014 in California, too. Long conversations. They have tremendous testing capability there too. Now, if they want to increase it, they can increase it, but they have plenty right now. You saw the maps the other day, when we put up the different sites in various states, and virtually all states are like that. How about you with the mask? Nice that you wear a mask. Q Yes. Mr. President, may I actually follow up on those maps from the other day? On Monday, a reporter for a local television station in Miami sent me a question asking if it was possible to get the information on those maps distributed to the media so that local TV stations and newspapers can check on that information. So if that could that be done \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Who did the maps? Do you \u2014 do you want do that? Do you want to say something? DR. BIRX: Thank you for talking about testing and testing capacity because we have been talking about that for several weeks, because we could see \u2014 and we did a full inventory of every single state and every single laboratory. And I also appreciate you talking about the implementation piece of the testing capacity. And it\u2019s complicated, so we have been \u2014 we have a team calling every lab and working through the American Society of Microbiology, as I mentioned before, to really work with every lab director to see what the issues are in each laboratory. And I just want to thank Administrator Verma, who really worked on increasing the funding for this test and uniquely doubling the funding for the coronavirus nucleic acid test from $50 to $100 to really address some of the issues about laboratory technicians. Because sometimes we think these tests run themselves; they don\u2019t. They actually need people to help with the machines. So we were talking about purchasing more machines; we actually need to have additional laboratory technicians to really be able to work all of those machines. And so it\u2019s lab by lab, state by state, and that\u2019s the dialogue that\u2019s going on now to unlock the full potential of the United States. Maybe the testing would not be needed at this moment, and maybe it is, but we want it also totally available in the fall if it comes to an issue where we have to distinguish between flu and COVID-19. So we\u2019re building infrastructure and capacity not only for today, but for tomorrow, and really showing a new way to really deal with pandemics and bring testing to scale. Because the country has never had to do this before. I mean, if you look at some of the other countries, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re struggling with some of the issues, from PPE to testing. And so this is a universal issue, but we\u2019re working on it as a collective to really have a very innovative and integrated way to approach testing. THE PRESIDENT: But without building new, they have tremendous capability. And \u2014 DR. BIRX: And the maps are \u2014 I will ask the companies, because, obviously, it\u2019s proprietary where every single machine is. And, you know, if you have that machine and five others, maybe you don\u2019t want to know \u2014 let that person know you have five others. It\u2019s kind of like Coke and Pepsi. So I think we\u2019re working very deliberately to really be able to share those maps. The governors, I can tell you that they \u2014 all of the state and local gover- \u2014 state governors and the mayors have those maps and the addresses and the type of machine for every single laboratory in their jurisdiction so know who they\u2019re testing. THE PRESIDENT: And many of the governors were not aware that those laboratories were available. Q One more for Dr. Birx, before you leave, on the \u2014 the state of California has now partially broken with CDC restrictions on who will get guidance and who should get testing because they want to test people without any symptoms at all in high-risk environments, like a nursing home. Do you agree with this? Vice President Pence, do you agree with this? DR. BIRX: Well, not only do we agree with it; it was in our guidelines. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s in our guidelines. DR. BIRX: That was fundamental to our guidelines, and I think we were the first group that said testing asymptomatics will be key. We\u2019ve always said that we think that\u2019s a significant contribution to infections. And we went to the places where we thought it was most critical to find cases the earliest. And so that is where we have asked states in the guidelines to start with nursing home, indigenous peoples, and people in underserved areas and cities to really ensure that we\u2019re monitoring for any type, because we know the asymptomatic piece may be the tip of the iceberg. In fact, it\u2019d be the iceberg underneath the surface. And so if you\u2019re only seeing cases and maybe this. But in parallel, we\u2019re working with states and local governments to really define what that population is by doing \u2014 in collaboration with states, working with them together, to really reinforce this antibody testing but in a careful way where you do two antibody testing to increase your sensitivity and specificity into the 99-plus percent range, because we think it\u2019s really important that you have a very high-quality test, but a high-quality test that you can really tell someone that they\u2019ve had this before. And so we\u2019re waiting to have those two tests that we can do in series to really assure people. But that is \u2014 that was in the guidelines from the very beginning, and we think it\u2019s fundamental, both for right now and going through the fall, because that will be our early alert if any of the COVID virus reappears. Q So how much more testing are we going to need? How much \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Jon, you didn\u2019t know that was in the guidelines? Q The CDC criteria says that (inaudible) \u2014 Q Well, it\u2019s currently in the CDC guidelines. You\u2019re saying that \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, but it\u2019s right \u2014 but it\u2019s right in the guidelines. Q Dr. Birx \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m surprised at you. Q \u2014 while you\u2019re there, can I just \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Jerome, would you like to say something on that, please? Please. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: Thank you, Mr. President. And I just want to reiterate to everyone that the task force and the administration have a commitment to protecting vulnerable people, and that includes in the area of testing. We\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk to many different groups, and we hear that testing is absolutely a concern. And we\u2019ll be giving you more details in the coming days, but I just want you to know that we\u2019re building on the public-private partnership that the President rolled out with pharmacy and retail companies like CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Walmart, and Kroger to accelerate testing for more Americans and more communities across the nation. We\u2019re going to be increasing access to testing for under-tested, underserved, and minority communities. And we\u2019re working closely with partners and states to establish sites in areas most in need of increased access to testing. We\u2019re using data \u2014 CDC-provided data \u2014 to locate sites and counties that are under-tested and socially vulnerable, especially with high populations of black, Hispanic, rural, and Native Americans. We\u2019re using the CDC\u2019s Vulnerability Index, as you heard about \u2014 heard about earlier to select sites. And this measures the resilience of communities when confronted by external stressors along four main themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status, and housing type. Our goal \u2014 our goal is to have about two-thirds of these initial sites located in counties with moderate to high social vulnerability and about a quarter of these sites and counties with high social vulnerability. So again, I want communities that are vulnerable to understand that we are strategically and intentionally making sure we\u2019re deploying testing in those areas so that people can get identified if they have symptoms, can get identified if they are asymptomatic, and that we will be able to deploy resources appropriately. Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jerome. Thank you. And I have to say our Surgeon General is doing a great job. Thank you. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Really good. OAN, in the back, please. Q Mr. President, thank you. Can we talk about Iran? You put out a message this morning making a rather big announcement for our military when it comes to Iranians\u2019 \u2014 Iranian aggression. Are you going to change, formally, rules of engagement for our U.S. military so that they can engage? THE PRESIDENT: No. We\u2019re covered \u2014 we\u2019re covered 100 percent. We don\u2019t want their gunboats surrounding our boats and traveling around our boats and having a good time. We don\u2019t want them anywhere near our boats. And \u2014 so you know the order I gave. I don\u2019t think I have to say it again, but I\u2019ve given that order. Under the Obama administration, it was taking place all the time. Under my administration, I gave this order early on and nothing happened. They were very nice; they were no problem. But then I noticed yesterday, they did that in a much lighter form, but they did that again. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to \u2014 we\u2019re not going to stand for it.\u201d So if they do that, that\u2019s putting our ships at danger and our great crews and sailors at \u2014 in danger. I\u2019m not going to let that happen. And we will \u2014 they\u2019ll shoot them out of the water. Q So the U.S. military does not have to change its rules of engagement in order to follow your directive? THE PRESIDENT: No, that\u2019s not rules of engagement; that\u2019s a threat when they get that close to our boat. And they have guns. They have very substantial weapons on those boats. But we\u2019ll shoot them out of the water. Okay? Please. Q Thank you, President Trump. If possible, I\u2019d like to ask a question to Dr. Fauci and then a very different one to you. To Dr. Fauci, today the CDC and the USDA said that the first pets in America had tested positive for coronavirus. What does that mean, and what should the public know about that? DR. FAUCI: Pets? Q Pets. Two pets. THE PRESIDENT: Pets. DR. FAUCI: So that question was asked before, but I\u2019d be happy to answer it again. Certainly, animals, pets can get infected. Big cats in zoos have been reported to be infected with coronavirus. There is no evidence that the virus is transmitted from a pet to a human. Now, obviously, is that impossible? I mean, biologically, you know, anything is possible, but there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that we\u2019ve seen, from an epidemiological standpoint, that pets can be transmitters within the household. So, it\u2019s not surprising. I mean, we \u2014 when you have viruses that can infect multiple species, isolating it from an animal doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it. THE PRESIDENT: What about the lion in the New York Zoo? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, well, you know, that\u2019s the lion in the New York \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: How did that \u2014 how did that happen? DR. FAUCI: You know what probably happened? I don\u2019t know, Mr. President, but I would imagine that one of the \u2014 one of the zookeepers probably had an asymptomatic infection, took care of the animal, gave him some food, touched him or whatever, and that\u2019s how he got it. Q A question for you, President Trump. My question for you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q \u2014 is: Earlier in these briefings, you talked a lot about giving Americans hope and you wanted to focus on that. But now that the crisis seems to perhaps be lessening, I wanted to ask you about accountability. And, of course, million \u2014 millions of Americans became familiar with you as the tough boss who fired people for doing a poor job. I wanted to ask you about two specific things. There was a report from Reuters today that the HHS Secretary put a former dog breeder in charge of day-to-day coronavirus efforts, to begin with. And also on \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: He did what? What? Q Reuters reported today that Alex Azar, the Secretary of HHS, put a former dog breeder \u2014 that was his most recently former job \u2014 in charge of day-to-day operations of the coronavirus. THE PRESIDENT: That, I don\u2019t know. But I \u2014 you\u2019re just telling me something. And what\u2019s the second? Q And the second one is on face masks. Taiwan has a bigger population than New York State. Early on, they had universal wearing of face masks. Here \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No problem with face masks, if the governors want to do that. You know, we ordered \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you know \u2014 500 million face masks. We have hundreds of millions right now. And if people want to wear them, it\u2019s up to the governors. If the governors want that, it\u2019s absolutely \u2014 now, it\u2019s more appropriate in some states, obviously, than others. You have the big plains and you have certain states where it\u2019s much less necessary. But, no, that\u2019s up to the governors. And we have that very well covered, I think, face masks. But we have \u2014 Q Here, people aren\u2019t wearing masks. THE PRESIDENT: We have hundreds of millions of face masks, and we have at least 500 million. That\u2019s a lot. We\u2019ll have them very shortly. Q And lots of people are wearing face masks now that the federal government advised. It was almost overnight. But less than a month ago, our Surgeon General said that \u2014 and I\u2019m quoting \u2014 they\u2019re, quote, \u201cnot effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus.\u201d I mean, is \u2014 should there be accountability there and also from HHS Secretary? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. Would anybody like to speak about it? I don\u2019t \u2014 I think, if \u2014 for \u2014 as \u2014 just so you understand, if somebody wants to wear them, I\u2019m all for it. Would somebody like to discuss that? THE VICE PRESIDENT: Bob Redfield. Bob. DR. FAUCI: Go \u2014 go for it, Bob. DR. REDFIELD: I think the comments that we made when we came into face masks \u2014 and I think it\u2019s important when we came out with the CDC guidance about face masks, or what we called \u201cface coverings\u201d \u2014 was, in recognition of the growing understanding of asymptomatic infection or pre-symptomatic infection, was the recognition that we could use a barrier. And the reason \u2014 you know, and I have mine when I\u2019m in public, right here, that I use \u2014 you know, that this barrier, in case I was, in fact, infected if I didn\u2019t know, is a barrier to prevent me to protect you in case I happened to be asymptomatically infected. There\u2019s very good data to show that the ability of viral particles to go through a barrier is substantially dishmininished [sic] \u2014 diminished. And that\u2019s why we recommended these face coverings. I think if you go back to when CDC came out with that recommendation, some people may think, intuitively, it\u2019s to protect them from getting infected. No, it was to protect you from potentially getting infected by me when I go out in public. Jerome, do you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Jerome, please. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: I actually appreciate you asking that question because it\u2019s one that \u2014 that we\u2019ve had to clarify several times, and I understand why the American public has been confused over time. As Dr. Redfield mentioned, initially we said, based on CDC, World Health Organization, and most other major public health organizations that the public needed to know that these masks are not effective or shown to be effective in preventing you, if you wear a mask, from catching coronavirus. Another important thing to remember is the context of those statements was a run on medical masks, on N95 masks, and our healthcare workers were at risk. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: What\u2019s changed? What\u2019s changed is, we found out that, unlike past viruses that are spread through the respiratory route, a significant proportion of coronavirus cases can be traced back to asymptomatic spread. So the task force deliberated this. We\u2019ve always told you that we will look at the facts and we will give people recommendations based on the best available evidence at the time. And once we saw that asymptomatic spread, we said, \u201cWell, masks still aren\u2019t effective, from our point of view, at preventing you from catching coronavirus in a significant way.\u201d But we\u2019ve always told people that they should wear masks, if they know they have symptoms, to prevent them from spreading to other people. Well, now that we know about 25 to 50 percent of people are spreading asymptomatically, we suggested people wear cloth facial coverings to prevent asymptomatic spread. You wear your mask to protect me. I wear my mask \u2014 and Dr. Redfield mentioned it \u2014 I\u2019ve got my mask \u2014 I believe I have mine on me, Bob. I carry mine around with me too. I wear my mask to protect you. We\u2019re six feet away, which is why I\u2019m not wearing my mask to protect you now, and we also all have been tested. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m not wearing mine now. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, but I\u2019m right next to you, so. (Laughter.) SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: Well, I\u2019ll put mine on if you want me to, sir. But \u2014 but again, important to note that if you\u2019re going to wear a mask, it\u2019s not a substitute for social distancing. Still, social distancing is the number one thing you can do. Number two, it\u2019s important to know that you should practice good hand hygiene and not touch your face, because you still can touch a surface and bring disease to your face. And number three \u2014 this is the most important \u2014 well, it\u2019s just as important: Please, save the medical masks, the N95s for the healthcare workers, because the cloth facial coverings are effective, as far as we know right now, based on the best available evidence, at preventing you from spreading disease to other people. So no inconsistency there. It\u2019s just the recommendation changed because the information changed, and that\u2019s what you want from your public health leaders. Q There\u2019s been the now argument made that you knew about the asymptomatic transmission at the time that you said that and that you were essentially misleading the public? THE PRESIDENT: No, I think it\u2019s (inaudible). SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: Well, I made \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s answered that question. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: The honest answer to you is: No, we did not. That was a recommendation of the World Health Organization and the CDC, and we gave you the best information we could at the time. So I actually, a little bit, resent that implication because I work hard to try to protect the American people, and we are always going to give the American people the best information we have available at the time. And we don\u2019t \u2014 and we have \u2014 we\u2019re humble enough to say, \u201cLook, if we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re going to change. We\u2019re going to change our recommendations.\u201d THE PRESIDENT: Just a wise-guy question, that\u2019s all. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Please, go ahead. Q Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the launch of the military satellite by Iran. I wanted to get your response to that. Do you see this an advancement of the missile program? THE PRESIDENT: You mean the shot they took? Well, they say no. Okay? They say all sorts. \u201cIt was for television\u201d. Does anybody really believe that? They want to have better television in Iran, so they say. No, we\u2019re watching Iran very closely. Very closely. Q Are you concerned \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: We know more about Iran than they do. Right now, we know more than they do. So we know all about it. We watched it; we knew it was going up. We followed it very closely. They say it was for television. Yes, please. Q Are you concerned, though, Mr. President? Q Mr. President, I have a question for Dr. Fauci. THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Finish up there, please. Q Yeah, very quickly. Are you concerned that they see this as a potential vulnerability on the part of the United States? There is the outbreak \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: See what? What is vulnerable? Q Military readiness. The outbreak on the Roosevelt, the fact that you\u2019re consumed with dealing with coronavirus here in the United States. THE PRESIDENT: Her, I read where various navies have had outbreaks of COVID. Look, we\u2019re in 184 different \u2014 different nations right now. A hundred and eight-four \u2014 the COVID. No, we have a problem on \u2014 that just shows you how rapidly it spreads. It started off with two sailors and then 10 sailors and 20, and now I hear it\u2019s 540, of which one has died and a few are very sick. But most of them are back in \u2014 you know, in great shape. But we did \u2014 we did lose one, and it attacked the lungs of that young person. And then we also had a number of that were quite sick, but they\u2019re all either better or getting better. But most of them are better for a long time already. Okay, please. Q Mr. President, can I \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, just one second. Q Thanks, Mr. President. As you know, over the course of the past few weeks, there have been the closures of several meat-processing companies across the country in several states. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q Is this a concern to you? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q Are you going to increase testing in these facilities because the workforce is getting sick? THE PRESIDENT: Look at South Dakota, how well the governor is \u2014 yeah, look at South Dakota, how well the governor has done there. And, all of a sudden, you have a big spike in one location. And she\u2019s got that very much under control, as you know. But nevertheless, that was surprising. And they had a big one right near where you were yesterday, as I understand it. And \u2014 so yeah, we\u2019re concerned about that. Q Is the food supply \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re closing one or two of the plants, actually. Q Is the food supply secure? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, totally secure. It\u2019s in great shape. Yeah, in the back. You didn\u2019t go. Q Thank you, Mr. President. The Attorney General in the State of Missouri filed a law \u2014 a law case against China \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Against China. Q \u2014 accusing it of lying and covering up about the origin of the virus. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q Do support that? And do you call for international \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Well, I haven\u2019t seen the case. I know about the case. He filed a case against China. I love Missouri, as you know. It\u2019s great. But I\u2019m going to take a look at it. I actually know about it very much. I have to take a look at it. I have not seen the case, in terms of reading it, but I will be doing that. Q But would you call for international investigation? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re going to have to take a look. Oh, we\u2019re doing investigations. We\u2019re doing our own. But I do want to see and review that lawsuit. I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t be the last one. Yeah. Q Mr. President, yes, I just had a follow \u2014 a question for Dr. Fauci, if you don\u2019t mind. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure. Q And I\u2019m happy to ask you one after. So Jon had asked the President about Rick Bright, and he said he wasn\u2019t sure who that was, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar who he is since he was the head of BARDA. So this concern or an accusation he\u2019s raised that he was removed from his job because he protested widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, are you familiar with the situation? And do you feel like public health experts feel they are able to speak publicly or to speak out in opposition to the things? DR. FAUCI: Here I am. Q Yeah. DR. FAUCI: So you don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any concern among \u2014 DR. FAUCI: No. No. Q \u2014 people at the NIH right now or in the public health community? DR. FAUCI: At the NIH, absolutely not. Q Dr. Fauci, knowing Dr. Bright and knowing what his gifts are as one of the country\u2019s leading experts on vaccines, are those gifts best suited at NIH rather than BARDA? What\u2019s he going to be doing with you? DR. FAUCI: What is he going to be doing at the NIH? Q So, first of all, are his gifts best suited to work with you rather than BARDA? DR. FAUCI: No, I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t really think I can comment on somebody\u2019s relative gifts. I mean, he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s going to be at the NIH, and he\u2019s going to be responsible, from what I hear \u2014 again, this is what I\u2019ve heard \u2014 that he\u2019s going to be responsible for the development of diagnostics, which is very, very important. The NIH is going to be involved in trying to develop new-generation diagnostics, which we feel is going to be very important for the future of being able to facilitate the kinds of things that now are sometimes problematic. Q Are you concerned at all that he \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And why did you say that he has great gifts or gifts? What, do you know him? Q Well, that\u2019s his expertise. I mean, I\u2019m just looking at his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but have you reviewed him? Have you \u2014 have you studied him? Have you reported on him? You said, \u201chis gifts.\u201d His gifts. I mean \u2014 Q He\u2019s worked his entire career developing vaccines, including the \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Well, that doesn\u2019t mean you have gifts. I know a lot of people, they play baseball, but they can\u2019t hit 150 in the Major Leagues. Q Well, he helped develop the flu vaccine last year. THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but you talk about his great gifts. Go ahead, please. Q Mr. President, thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Please, go ahead. You can go. Please. Q Thank you, sir. I have two questions, one for myself and then one for a colleague of ours who cannot be here today because of social distancing. THE PRESIDENT: From where? From where? Q I\u2019m with USA Today. First, the executive director of the National Association of Counties said today that the White House did not want to see money for local \u2014 state and local governments in the latest COVID assistance package. THE PRESIDENT: And they didn\u2019t want to say what? What does that mean? Tell me. Q I\u2019m sorry? THE PRESIDENT: What does it mean? Repeat it. Say it a little differently. Q The executive director of the National Association of Counties said today that the White House objected to putting funding for state and local governments into the latest COVID assistance package. THE PRESIDENT: Oh, really? That\u2019s interest- \u2014 is he a Democrat? Q I do not know, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Well, check it. How can you ask that questions without knowing? Q Okay. Well \u2014 but what \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Check it out. You\u2019ll find out. Q I\u2019ll check it out. But he says \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Okay, what\u2019s the next question? Q His question was \u2014 THE President: You know, the numbers \u2014 you know, the money we put into states, local governments, everything else? And they have to be responsible for their own finances. But you check it out. Go ahead. What\u2019s the next \u2014 Q Well, his point was \u2014 he said that you felt like that this would somehow be a disincentive for states to open their economies. Is he correct about that? THE PRESIDENT: How would he know what I felt? I never spoke to him. I don\u2019t even know who he is. Q I\u2019m asking you, sir. THE PRESIDENT: You don\u2019t know who he is either. Q Yes, his name is Matthew Chase, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Okay, it doesn\u2019t help me, and it doesn\u2019t help you. Okay, go ahead, Jeff. Q Mr. President, also a follow-up \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Do we want to keep going a little while longer or no? Q Yes. Yes. THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re not going to say, \u201cOh, he took questions all night long\u201d? Q No, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Okay? Right? Q Yes, please. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Okay, well, good. How many questions can you ask? Go ahead. Q Also \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: We \u2014 we all have fun, because we\u2019re talking about something very important. The main thing is I think we\u2019re getting to a lot of solutions. We never want this to happen again. We never want this to happen again \u2014 what happened. And if it should come back in some form, we want to snuff it out very quickly before anything can happen. And I personally hope it doesn\u2019t come back in the fall as a combination of the flu or not as a combination of the flu. But I think we learned a lot. And, you know, some of these questions are good. Some of them are ridiculous, frankly, but some of them are very \u2014 I think some of them are very important questions. Very important. You know, when you asked Dr. Fauci about the right to speak \u2014 if I let him speak, I\u2019ll let anybody speak. And we love him. Let\u2019s go. Q Mr. President, Senator \u2014 Senator McConnell said today that he would prefer to see states that have high public pensions declare bankruptcy, rather than taking on more \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I \u2014 I heard he said that. Q \u2014 federal bailout money. THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know what he said. I\u2019ll have to call him and ask him. Q That\u2019s what he said. THE PRESIDENT: Well, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to have to look at it directly. Q Would you agree with him on that? Or \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I can\u2019t tell you that. I have to see \u2014 I want to base it on fact and reason. I want to see what he said \u2014 you know, why he said it and how he said it. I\u2019d have to watch him say it. But some of the states are not doing well, let\u2019s face it. And some are doing phenomenally well. A state where Mike was governor, Indiana \u2014 I looked at their numbers. They have \u2014 it\u2019s incredible what they\u2019re doing. Some states are doing fantastically well. Iowa is doing great. You have \u2014 you have states doing well, and you have some states that aren\u2019t doing well. We know the ones. I don\u2019t have to mention the ones that aren\u2019t doing well, but you do have states that are in trouble. And certainly they\u2019re coming back to talk to us. We\u2019ll see what happens. Q Are you concerned \u2014 are you concerned, sir, about the growing U.S. national debt as a result of these stimulus packages? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we have a choice. Do we have a choice? Yeah. I\u2019m always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem. This was \u2014 we were attacked. This was an attack. This wasn\u2019t just, \u201cOh, gee.\u201d And this wasn\u2019t the flu, by the way. You know, they like to say the flu. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. 1917 was the last time. We were attacked. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy \u2014 better than China, better than any place. They will tell you that. I dealt with them for a long time, and they will tell \u2014 we have the greatest economy and we built it in the last three years, three and a half years we built it. And then one day, they came and they said, \u201cYou have to close it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got to be\u2026\u201d \u201cThese people right here, they said you have to\u2026\u201d They came into my office \u2014 into the Oval Office, and they said, \u201cWe have to close the economy.\u201d I said, \u201cLet\u2019s explain this. Explain this to me.\u201d The greatest ever in history and we had to close it. Now we\u2019re going to open it again, and we\u2019re going to be just as strong or stronger. But you have to spend some money to get",

                              "text": "Rose Garden March 29, 2020 5:43 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody being here. Beautiful day in the Rose Garden. Tremendous distance between chairs. Social distancing. You practice it very well. We appreciate it. That\u2019s great. I want to start today by highlighting several critical developments on both the testing and treatment that will help us win our war against the coronavirus. On Friday, the FDA authorized a new test developed by Abbott Labs that delivers lightning-fast results in as little as five minutes. That\u2019s a whole new ballgame. I want to thank Abbott Labs for the incredible work they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve been working around the clock. Normally, this approval process from the FDA would take 10 months, and even longer, but we did it in four weeks. Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week. And as you know, even before this development, we\u2019ve been doing more test \u2014 tests than any other country anywhere in the world. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we\u2019ve been testing. It\u2019s also one of the reasons that we\u2019re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we\u2019ve been doing more testing. So we have bigger numbers to look at. I want to also thank General Semonite, of the Army Corps of Engineers, and General Polowczyk, who\u2019s here with us, who\u2019s going to say a few words in a little while. What the Army Corps of Engineers did, along with FEMA, in New York was incredible. They built 2,900 beds\u2019 worth of hospital. An incredible hospital in the Javits Center, which I know well. And I just want to say that was unreal. They did it in less than four days. People have never seen anything like that. And it\u2019s an incredible, complex, top-of-the-line hospital. They did it so quickly. Everyone is trying to figure out how they did it, including me \u2014 and I was a good builder. But they did it very quickly, Mike. So we\u2019re very \u2014 we\u2019re very happy. So I want to thank Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA \u2014 the incredible job they have done. Now they\u2019re moving to other locations throughout the country where they already have people building hospitals. We\u2019re doing them in Louisiana and New Jersey \u2014 many, many other places. But these are incredible men and women, and they worked around the clock. And the people of New York are very happy. Governor Cuomo expressed his thanks, which we appreciate. But these are \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s nobody could have done a job like that. Most people have never seen anything like it. The deployment of rapid testing will vastly accelerate our ability to monitor, track, contain, and ultimately defeat the virus. We will defeat the virus. It will also allow us to test doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers immediately and enable us to act quickly and aggressively to shut down the spread of the virus \u2014 so important \u2014 in critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes. And we will ensure that we can give cities and states the best information to guide local decision makers and making. I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients \u2014 people in New York \u2014 along with the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin. And it\u2019s very early yet; it\u2019s only \u2014 it started two days ago. But we will see what happens. I want to thank Stephen Hahn, who\u2019s a great doctor \u2014 left one of the best jobs in our country running an incredible Hospital in Texas. And he\u2019s the head of the FDA. And Stephen got approval for that so fast. Let\u2019s see how it works. It may, it may not. But we may have some incredible results. We\u2019re going to know soon. So it\u2019s tested \u2014 it\u2019s being tested on 1,100 people in New York. The FDA is also allowing the emergency use of a blood-related therapy called convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for seriously ill patients. This treatment involves taking blood plasma from patients who have already recovered from the virus. So they\u2019ve recovered; they\u2019re strong. Something was good in them that worked. And so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well \u2014 meaning, their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus \u2014 and transfusing it into six [six] patients \u2014 sick patients, very \u2014 very, very powerfully. So, sick patients will be transfused with the blood taken to boost their immune system. We\u2019ll see what happens. And we\u2019re having some early results that are good, but we will see. And that\u2019s going, I think, very rapidly. Again, we got approvals in, really, very quick time. We\u2019re also looking at an approval for the sterilization of masks. I kept saying to myself \u2014 I\u2019d see some of the masks are very complex. We\u2019re delivering millions, by the way. Millions. But I kept saying, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they able to use that mask a second, third, fourth time?\u201d And Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, called me. They have a company that is in the final process of getting approval for the sterilization of masks, and in some cases, depending on the mask \u2014 some of these masks are very, very strong, very powerful, very strong material \u2014 they\u2019re able to sterilize the mask up to 20 times. So that\u2019s, I guess, like getting 20 masks. And so we worked on that. As soon as I heard from Mike today, I got involved, and the FDA is now involved. And we\u2019re trying to get a fast approval for the sterilization of masks. That would be a tremendous difference. That would be really helpful. While much of the research has to be done \u2014 we have a lot of research left to do, obviously \u2014 this treatment on plasma has shown promising results in other countries. We\u2019re in communication with other countries, and very strong communications. And they\u2019re very reliant on us in just about all cases. We have the greatest people in the world. They\u2019re very, very anxious to find out how we\u2019re doing on our different things, whether it\u2019s a cure or whether it\u2019s really anything having to do with getting people better. We have some interesting things will be announced, I think over the next few weeks, but we\u2019ll see what happens. They\u2019re being tested right now. The vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer, but I\u2019d like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick. And we\u2019re working on that at a level that people would be amazed. These are incredible people. They don\u2019t stop. This method also has been used for more than a century \u2014 and that\u2019s the blood-related therapy \u2014 you know, more than a century to fight off infectious diseases. So it\u2019s not unusual. Our level of complexity has changed, but it\u2019s a concept that\u2019s been used for a long time, including during the Spanish Flu epidemic. And that was really a pandemic of proportions like, frankly, nobody has seen until what we\u2019re facing now. That was in 1918. You know what the result of that was; probably from 75 to 100 million people were killed. And also, other viruses, like the one in this outbreak \u2014 this is a very tough one. This is a tough one because it spreads so quickly, like nothing we\u2019ve seen. It spreads so easily, so quickly. We\u2019re unleashing every tool in our nation\u2019s vast arsenal \u2014 economic, medal [sic] \u2014 medical. If you look, medical, and scientific, military. Homeland Security is working very, very hard with all of them in order to vanquish the virus. As you know, every level of government \u2014 state, local, and federal \u2014 is working nonstop to obtain more personal protective equipment for frontline workers. We\u2019re delivering vast orders of this material. I\u2019m going to ask a couple of the people here to join me that both make it and deliver it. Joining us today are the leaders of America\u2019s largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, including McKesson, Cardinal Health, Henry Schein, Owens & Minor, Medline, FedEx, and UPS. We just concluded a very productive meeting about ways to keep our supply chains and delivery systems moving at top speed. And maybe I\u2019d like to just ask for a couple of minutes for Mike Kaufmann to come up, and maybe Ed Pesicka. Mike is with Cardinal and Ed is Owen & Minor. But I \u2014 and I appreciate. And if anybody else has anything, please come up. But if you could come up, Mike, for a second and, Ed, for a second. Just, if you could maybe say what you told me before when we had the meeting. Thank you. MR. KAUFMANN: Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks for your leadership on this. Because of that leadership, we have really seen the government agencies working with industry like no time before. We have seen HHS, FEMA, the CDC work incredibly effectively with all of the distributors, and all of the distributors working together for the good of the people. And all of us have been so focused on making sure that we take care of our customers because our customers are the ones that are taking care of the patients every day. And we need to do everything we can to make things good for them. And so it\u2019s been great to see how well all these government agencies have been coordinating together with us. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. MR. KAUFMANN: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it. Please. MR.PESICKA: Thank you, Mr. President. Let me first start by thanking the administration for all the support you have provided to the industry. And one of the things we did \u2014 we did hear the challenge. And starting in January, we\u2019ve ramped up our production in the Americas, including our facility in North Carolina, where we are now manufacturing an additional 40 to 50 million masks per month to get into the U.S. healthcare system. And we talked a little about this in the pre-meeting: One of the issues we\u2019re struggling with is the demand increase. You know, used an anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly ten- to twenty thousand masks a week are now using two- to three hundred thousand masks a week. So you multiply that times the entire pop- \u2014 the entire U.S., let alone the same demand outside of the U.S. That\u2019s part of the issue we\u2019re running into: Is even with a significant ramp-up in supply, you know, there\u2019s still that demand that is \u2014 that is much greater than that supply. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. MR.PESICKA: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: And I bring that up because when we discussed, back in a room \u2014 we were in a conference room \u2014 a very nice one, actually; it\u2019s called the Cabinet Room \u2014 that statement was made that they\u2019ve been delivering for years, 10- to 20,000 masks. Okay, it\u2019s a New York hospital. Very \u2014 it\u2019s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20, to 300,000? 10- to 20,000 masks to 300,000? Even though this is different, something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So, somebody should probably look into that, because I just don\u2019t see, from a practical standpoint, how that\u2019s possible to go from that to that. And we have that happening in numerous places \u2014 not to that extent; that was the highest number I\u2019ve heard. That\u2019s the highest number you\u2019ve seen, I would imagine, right? But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals. He knows the system better than anybody. And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number. So thank you very much. I hope I didn\u2019t get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York. FEMA is working with these companies to launch Project Airbridge to expedite the movement of critical supplies from other countries to the United States. The first flight arrived at JFK Airport, New York, this morning, filled with 80 tons of personal protective equipment, including 130,000 N95 respirators \u2014 those are the ones that we were talking about before \u2014 1.8 million face masks and gowns, 10.3 million gloves, and many other things. Millions and millions of different items. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights and is adding more daily. We hope to have about 50 flights. We\u2019re going to have \u2014 I think including the one that came in today, we\u2019re up at 51 flights with these massive planes from the different companies. That was so nice to be here today. Would you like to say something on behalf? Please, come up. Thank you. MS. LANE: Thank you, Mr President, for the incredible leadership. I will share with you that UPS is really proud to be part of this effort. Vice President Pence and I had the opportunity to speak before, and the way we\u2019re going to win this war is with great logistics, and UPS is going to be part of that effort. We have a Big Brown army \u2014 495,000 UPSers across the country that are ready to deliver. We\u2019re bringing in the supplies from anywhere around the world as fast as we can so that they can serve the communities that need them most. We\u2019re proud to be partnering with the states as well, because we know that in partnership with those states, we can deliver what is needed everywhere. So thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Great job you\u2019re doing. Please. Thank you very much. MR. TYLER: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I would certainly like to echo my colleagues\u2019 comments that the collaboration amongst many of the government agencies and the private market and the distributors represented here today has been incredible. It has been increasing and ramping up over the past weeks. Today\u2019s first delivery of Operation Airbridge, I think, is the first evidence that it\u2019s working. The 51 flights you referenced we\u2019re excited about. We look to build upon that. So I would echo my thanks for your leadership, and certainly to the staffs, for the terrific partnership and the commitment to protect the people we think about most often, which are the people on the frontlines providing care. And maybe just a quick word of thanks, on behalf of all the CEOs here, to our teams that continue to show up in warehouses across the country, in pharmacies across the country, and do their jobs to keep the supply chain going. The supply chain is working. It\u2019s resilient. Supply is a challenge, and we\u2019re tackling that. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Great job. Please. MR. MILLS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And thanks to FEMA and HHS. I think great leadership, and it\u2019s really working well. The demand has skyrocketed, and we\u2019re doing a lot of things to bring in more masks, more \u2014 other protective apparel. We are involved in reprocessing masks, and we\u2019ve already started at about 100,000 masks per day, and we hope to expand from there. So we\u2019re quite optimistic about it. THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Yeah. MR. MILLS: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Fantastic job. Anybody else, if you want? Yes, please. You\u2019re doing such a great job, we have to \u2014 MR. CONNETT: Well, thanks. THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 have everybody if they want. MR. CONNETT: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. We appreciate the opportunity to work with your administration on a lot of collaborative fronts. Number one, we\u2019ve all talked about PPE products; that\u2019s critical. And it\u2019s not just to the hospitals \u2014 that\u2019s a must \u2014 but it\u2019s really to all healthcare providers out there working on the frontline. So our commitment is there to get it to the hotspots and get it to the care providers that are taking care of those patients. It\u2019s absolutely key. Second, we talked in there about buying in America and getting resources back here and manufacturing in America. That is critical. A lesson to be learned from where we are. And lastly, we\u2019re proud that we introduced a test. We need to get some more tests out there in a rapid form. We\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019ve worked with your administration very closely, and the FDA, and we\u2019re very grateful for that because it\u2019s a quick, rapid antibody test that is needed as well. So we\u2019re really proud to work with your administration. All going well. Thanks so much. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. So thank you all very much and for the great job you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s really incredible, frankly. Many of the states are stocked up. Some of them don\u2019t admit it, but they have \u2014 we have sent just so much \u2014 so many things to them and \u2014 including ventilators. You know, there\u2019s a question as to hoarding of ventilators. Some hospitals and independent hospitals \u2014 and some hospital chains, as we call them \u2014 they are holding ventilators; they don\u2019t want to let them up. We need them for certain areas where there\u2019s big problems. We can\u2019t hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road. So we\u2019ve delivered a lot, and this group has been really fantastic. We want to thank you. And UPS and FedEx, in particular, you\u2019ve gone absolutely out of your way, so we appreciate everything you\u2019ve done and delivered. The federal government continues to mobilize every resource to make sure our frontline doctors and nurses have the equipment needed to save American lives. Yesterday, I visited Naval Station Norfolk as the USNS Comfort departed from New York three weeks ahead of schedule, fully loaded with 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, and hundreds of the best doctors, nurses, and medical professionals anywhere in the United States Navy \u2014 anywhere, frankly, in the United States. It was an incredible thing to see. Mostly you saw that on television as it was leaving. It left literally three weeks early. It was under maintenance, and they got the maintenance done very quickly. They work round the clock as many of the people have. And it was a great sight. Additionally, two of the country\u2019s largest health insurers, Humana and Cigna, are announcing that they will waive co-pays \u2014 which is a big deal for anybody that understands insurance; they don\u2019t waive co-pays too easily, but we\u2019ve asked them to do it and they\u2019ve done it \u2014 coinsurance and deductibles for the coronavirus treatments to help ease the financial burden on American families during this pandemic. So they\u2019re waiving co -pays, coinsurance, and deductibles. Nobody has \u2014 I don\u2019t think anyone has heard of that one. Have you heard of that one before? I haven\u2019t heard. I want to thank them. Great companies. Today I spoke with Wolfgang Puck. Wolfgang Puck is a great restauranteur, as you know, as is Jean-Georges and Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud, and other leaders in the restaurant business, which has been probably one of the hardest-hit industries. I\u2019ve directed my staff to use any and all authority available to give restaurants, bars, clubs incentives to stay open. You\u2019re going to lose all these restaurants and they\u2019re not going to make it back. They have to get going. So what I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m going to tell Secretary Mnuchin and also our great Secretary of Labor, who you know very well, to immediately start looking into the restoring of the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations that set the restaurant business back a lot when it was done originally, and then done not so long ago. And we\u2019re going to go to deductibility so that companies can send people to restaurants. I think it\u2019ll have a tremendous impact and maybe keep them open. I mean, don\u2019t forget, some are closing right now, despite the fact that they could be open in the not-too-distant future, and we expect that. But there are some that aren\u2019t going to be able to get open, and we want to make sure they do. So we\u2019re going to look at the restoration \u2014 restoring the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations so that corporations can send people to restaurants and take a deduction on it like they did in the old days. That was when restaurants were doing really well. The financial relief bill I signed on Friday provided historic relief for American workers and small businesses, and it includes $350 billion in job restoration and retention. So if you look at job retention loans for small businesses, that\u2019s a big deal, with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying the worker. So it\u2019s $350 billion \u2014 job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying workers. I mean, how about that? Three hundred billion dollars in direct cash payments are being sent to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year; $3,400 for the typical family of four. So they\u2019ll be getting a check for $3,400 for the typical family of four. Approximately $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. Under this plan, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months. The bill provides for these unemployment checks to be delivered through the existing state unemployment systems, not us. State. And I was opposed to this method because many of the states have very antiquated computer systems that are 45 years old, and they\u2019re not prepared to handle this kind of distribution, this kind of money coming in so quickly. They\u2019re not set up for that. And I didn\u2019t want to do it but our opponents wanted it, so we did it. And if they don\u2019t get their money fast, I\u2019m going to ask that we convene the federal government \u2014 that we come back to Congress and we\u2019ll do something where we take care of it, because we can take care of it very easily and quickly \u2014 and I said that. But a lot of these systems, they\u2019re so old and so antiquated at the state level that they\u2019re going to \u2014 they have the money, and they\u2019re going to get the money very quickly, but they\u2019re not going to be able to distribute it. So remember what I said, and we will, if we have to, call Congress back or find some other way of delivery of the money. Throughout this great national struggle, the American people have embodied the unrivaled patriotism and willpower that has led America to conquer every challenge \u2014 every single one in our nation\u2019s history. More than 90 percent of Americans say they\u2019re staying home as much as possible, putting their lives, their careers, their educations, and their dreams on hold out of devotion to their fellow citizens and to their country. Social distancing: That\u2019s the way you win. These shared sacrifices are pulling our nation together like never before. Family bonds are strengthening. Neighbors are looking after neighbors. It\u2019s incredible. I\u2019m seeing, you\u2019re seeing, everybody is seeing what\u2019s happening. Communities are rallying for the cause, and all divisions are fading away. The Americans of every background are uniting to help our nation in this hour of need. It\u2019s up to 151 countries. So when we say \u201cour nation\u201d \u2014 our nation and the world, when you think. Think of it: 151 countries. Somebody said to me today that wasn\u2019t in this particular world \u2014 they didn\u2019t know that we had that many countries. A hundred and fifty-one countries. That\u2019s something. And some are struggling at a level that nobody would have believed possible. If you look at Italy, if you look at \u2014 France is having big problems. Spain is having incredible problems. Something we did very well is, when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level, that was a good thing to do, a great thing to do. We would have had thousands and thousands of more deaths. And we also stopped the inflow from Europe at a very early level. But those things were very important, especially the initial one, because we had never done anything like it, where we closed our borders to a country like that. The modeling put together by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and our other top healthcare ex- \u2014 I mean, we have \u2014 and these people are amazing \u2014 the healthcare experts who, in this country, are the best in the world. They demonstrate that the mitigation measures we are putting in place may significantly reduce the number of new infections and, ultimately, the number of fatalities. I want the American people to know that your selfless, inspiring, and valiant efforts are saving countless lives. You\u2019re making the difference. The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks. So, I\u2019ll say it again: The peak, the highest point of death rates \u2014 remember this \u2014 is likely to hit in two weeks. Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all. Therefore, the next two weeks, and during this period, it\u2019s very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines. Have to follow the guidelines that our great Vice President holds up a lot. He\u2019s holding that up a lot. He believes in it so strongly. The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end. Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30th to slow the spread. On Tuesday, we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings, supporting data, and strategy to the American people. So we\u2019ll be having lots of meetings in between, but we\u2019ll be having a very important statement made on Tuesday \u2014 probably Tuesday evening \u2014 on all of the findings, all of the data, and the reasons we\u2019re doing things the way we\u2019re doing them. We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery. We think, by June 1st, a lot of great things will be happening. I want every citizen in our country to take heart and confidence in the fact that we have the best medical minds in the world tackling this disease. We have the best science, the best researchers, and the best talent anywhere working night and day to protect your family and loved ones and to overcome this pandemic. With the grace of God, we are rising to the occasion. We are proving that no darkness can overshadow the eternal light of American courage. We will win. And when we do, we will rebound with astonishing force and speed. We will be stronger than ever, and we will have learned so much, where something like this can never hurt us to the extent it has \u2014 and the world \u2014 again. In our present crisis, the strength of our people is our single most important asset, and together we will defeat this invisible curse \u2014 this is invisible enemy \u2014 and rise to incredible new heights. So I just want to thank you all for being here. And we\u2019ll take some questions if you\u2019d like. Yeah, please. Kelly. Q Mr. President, Dr. Fauci said that we likely be in excess of a million cases in the United States, and deaths could exceed 100,000. Do you accept that assessment and has that formed your thinking about extending these guidelines? And you also talked about New York. Were you suggesting there has been inappropriate use of masks, or improper conduct with supplies? THE PRESIDENT: No, I want the people of New York to check \u2014 Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio \u2014 that when a hospital that\u2019s getting 10,000 masks goes to 300,000 masks during the same period \u2014 and that\u2019s a rapid period \u2014 I would like them to check that. Because I hear stories like that all the time. You know, we\u2019re develop- \u2014 we\u2019re delivering millions and millions of different products and all we do is hear that, \u201cCan you get some more?\u201d But when you hear that \u2014 and I heard that from one of the great companies of the world at doing this \u2014 it\u2019s a client. And they\u2019re going from \u2014 you heard it \u2014 10,000, 20,000, tops, to 300,000. And that\u2019s a hospital that\u2019s always full. So I think people should check that because there\u2019s something going on, whether \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding; I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out. Check it out. Q (Inaudible.) (Off-mic.) THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I think that\u2019s for other people to figure out. But you don\u2019t go from numbers like that. Now, other equipment likewise, because we\u2019re delivering a lot of ventilators, we\u2019re deve- \u2014 and we\u2019re building. By the way, we\u2019re building and buying, and we have a lot of ventilators that we\u2019re going to be sending out very soon. We also have, right now, in the stockpile, almost 10,000 ventilators that we have to hold in case of emergency. We don\u2019t want them going out and then Louisiana has a tremendous problem, which we now know they do. You know, all of a sudden, it came very quickly. It came \u2014 I mean, Louisiana was doing so fantastically well. Then, all of a sudden, there was a big rash of cases. So, we have to be prepared to move the ventilators. They\u2019re very important pieces of equipment. They\u2019re very expensive and they\u2019re very complex. They\u2019re very \u2014 it\u2019s like building a car. You know, these are expensive, complicated \u2014 very complicated pieces of equipment. So we now have 10,000. And we inherited a system which was broken. Just like \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget the day when a general came and said, \u201cSir\u201d \u2014 my first week in office \u2014 \u201cwe have no ammunition.\u201d That was in the military. We\u2019ve now rebuilt our military stronger than it\u2019s ever been. And we have so much ammunition. You wouldn\u2019t believe it, how much ammunition we have. But the same thing here. We had \u2014 we had a stockpile that was deficient. We had testing that was no good. We had a testing situation that just wasn\u2019t right. It was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken, and it was only good for a very small situation. But what I\u2019d like to do is I\u2019d like to ask Dr. Fauci to come forward and discuss the number, because I think the number \u2014 I think the number is going to be a very different number than the numbers that you talked about. Please, Doctor, you might talk about that. DR. FAUCI: Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, the number I gave out is, you know, based on modeling. And I think it\u2019s entirely conceivable that, if we do not mitigate to the extent that we\u2019re trying to do, that you could reach that number. Q One hundred thousand? DR. FAUCI: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s possible. I mean, you could make a big soundbite about it, but the fact is it\u2019s possible. What we\u2019re trying to do is not let that happen. So instead of concentrating on the upper and the lower, we\u2019re saying that we\u2019re trying to push it all the way down. But the second part of your question was \u2014 yes, we feel that the mitigation that we\u2019re doing right now is having an effect. It\u2019s very difficult to quantitate it because you have two dynamic things going on at the same time: You have the virus going up, and you have the mitigation trying to push it down. But the decision to prolong \u2014 not prolong, but to extend this mitigation process until the end of April, I think, was a wise and prudent decision. Dr. Birx and I spent a considerable amount of time going over all the data, why we felt this was a best choice of us, and the President accepted it. So, in direct answer to your question: The idea that we may have these many cases played a role in our decision in trying to make sure that we don\u2019t do something prematurely and pull back when we should be pushing. THE PRESIDENT: Deborah, please. Would you \u2014 can you explain the 2.2 million, if we did nothing? DR. BIRX: Yeah. THE PRESIDENT: Because a lot of people would like to know that. DR. BIRX: So, thank you. You all know, we\u2019ve all \u2014 you\u2019ve all seen the models. You\u2019ve seen the models from Imperial. You\u2019ve seen the models from Columbia. We\u2019ve reviewed 12 different models. And then we went back to the drawing board over the last week or two, and worked from the ground up, utilizing actual reporting of cases. It\u2019s the way we built the HIV model, the TB model, the malaria model. And when we finished, the other group that was working in parallel \u2014 which we didn\u2019t know about \u2014 HIME [IHME] and Chris Murray ended up at the same numbers. So if you go on his website, you can see the concern that we had, with the gray \u2014 growing number of potential fatalities. All of the flu models predicted anywhere between 1.6 and 2.2 million fatalities, if we didn\u2019t mitigate. I think you all knew those numbers. Some of them predicted half of the United States would get infected and have that level of mortality. So we worked very hard together to really look at all of the impacts of the different mitigations that have been utilized around the world, and used that evidence base to really bring that data and that evidence to the President to consider for extending \u2014 which is not a simple situation when you ask people to stay home for another 30 days. And so they have to know that we\u2019ve really built this on scientific evidence and the potential to save, really, hundreds of thousands of American lives. And we know that\u2019s a huge sacrifice for everyone. We know it\u2019s a sacrifice for every mother and child and father who\u2019s also self-isolating. There are people that have to go out to work, and we know the compromises that they\u2019re making. But it\u2019s all to protect not only Americans, but the healthcare providers \u2014 the healthcare providers that are on the frontlines. And you\u2019ve seen them, and you\u2019ve seen how difficult this has been. And so, we\u2019re really working \u2014 there\u2019ll be a comprehensive piece presented on Tuesday that really talks about not only diagnosing individuals, but also increasing our surveillance now that we have more test kits so that we can really stop and contain new infections. At the same time, we\u2019re really dedicating test kits still to the critical diagnosis so people can get the treatment that they want and so that we can ensure, when people come to the hospital, that they know that the nurses and the doctors and the equipment that they need will be there to serve them. Because together as Americans, we\u2019re going to bring down the number of infections so we don\u2019t have 2.2 million deaths or 1.6 million deaths, but really work very hard to keep this in as low as number as we possibly can. THE PRESIDENT: I just want to reiterate, because a lot of people have been asking, \u201cWell, what would have happened if we did nothing? Did nothing \u2014 we just rode it out.\u201d And I\u2019ve been asking that question to Tony and Deborah, and they\u2019ve been talking to me about it for a long time. Other people have been asking that question. And I think we got our most accurate study today, or certainly most comprehensive. Think of the number: 2.2 \u2014 potentially 2.2 million people if we did nothing. If we didn\u2019t do the distancing, if we didn\u2019t do all of the things that we\u2019re doing. And when you hear those numbers, you start to realize that with the kind of work we went through last week, with the $2.2 trillion, it no longer sounds like a lot, right? So you\u2019re talking about \u2014 when I heard the number today \u2014 first time I\u2019ve heard that number, because I\u2019ve been asking the same question that some people have been asking \u2014 I felt even better about what we did last week with the $2.2 trillion, because you\u2019re talking about a potential of up to 2.2 million. And some people said it could even be higher than that. So you\u2019re talking about 2.2. million deaths \u2014 2.2 million people from this. And so, if we can hold that down, as we\u2019re saying, to 100,000 \u2014 that\u2019s a horrible number \u2014 maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 \u2014 we all, together, have done a very good job. But 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that. I\u2019m feeling very good about what we did last week. Q Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, please. Go ahead, please. Q Mr. President, given that you\u2019re announcing that you\u2019re extending these guidelines, was floating Easter a mistake, do you think? And \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No. Q \u2014 does this \u2014 can you tell us why and then \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It was just an aspiration. We actually will be hitting, potentially \u2014 and this was with our meeting before \u2014 on Easter, we probably \u2014 they \u2014 well, that could be a peak. That could be a peak period. That could be the peak. Sadly to say, that could be the peak number of deaths before it starts coming down. No, that was aspirational. We had a \u2014 an aspiration of Easter. But when you hear these kind of numbers and you hear the potential travesty, we don\u2019t want to do anything where \u2014 you know, we don\u2019t want to have a spike up. We don\u2019t want to do it soon, and then all of a sudden you go down \u2014 you\u2019re coming down and then you start going up again. Because we discussed that can happen, and we don\u2019t want that to happen. We\u2019ve gone through too much. So that was an aspirational number. I didn\u2019t say \u201cEaster.\u201d I said, \u201cIt would be a great thing, if we could do it by Easter.\u201d And we know much more now that we knew two, three weeks ago. Easter should be the peak number, and it should start coming down, and hopefully very substantially from that point. Q Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Okay? Thank you. Please. OAN. Q Jenn Pellegrino with OAN. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q Thank you, sir. Mr. President, your approval ratings have been the highest they\u2019ve ever been, as well as the ratings on your handling of the virus. Yet, there are some networks that are saying they\u2019re debating whether or not to carry these briefings live. Do you think there\u2019s a link between the two? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. I know that \u2014 boy, that\u2019s a nice question. Thank you very much. Yeah, I don\u2019t want high approval ratings for this. I wish we could have our old life back. We had the greatest economy that we\u2019ve ever had, and we didn\u2019t have death. We didn\u2019t have this. We didn\u2019t have this horrible scourge, this plague \u2014 you can call it whatever you want. The virus. But we\u2019re working very hard. That\u2019s all I know. You know, I see things \u2014 I see numbers. They don\u2019t matter to me. What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible. When you hear that 2.2 million people could have died if we didn\u2019t go through all of this, and now the number will be, you know, a much lower number. Hopefully, it\u2019s going to be the numbers that we\u2019re talking about. But \u2014 so I appreciate it very much. But, you know, what I want is I want our life back again. I want our country back. I want the world back. I want the world to get rid of this. This \u2014 again, 151 countries. And we\u2019re going to do it. We\u2019re going to have a great victory. We\u2019re going to have a great victory. Go ahead, please. Q You mentioned it, and I just want to make sure I was right. So, Humana and Cigna are going to waive, for all costs, for anybody that\u2019s got the coronavirus, they\u2019re going to take care of everything? THE PRESIDENT: Well, that\u2019s what they said. I told you what they\u2019re going to take. Q Right. THE PRESIDENT: Co-pays in particular, that\u2019s a big deal. Insurance companies don\u2019t do that, and I appreciate it. Humana and Cigna, they should be getting a lot of credit for that. Q Will there be other companies? Just those two? Or \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know. Well, those two are getting a lot of credit right now for it. And they should, because it\u2019s something that \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of money they\u2019re waiving. And so we thank them. Will there be other companies? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. There\u2019s great \u2014 Q Are you calling on them to do it, sir? THE PRESIDENT: There\u2019s great spirit. I\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 yeah, I\u2019d love to have them do it. Let them waive those co-pays. There\u2019s a great spirit in this country right now. I mean, I know insurance companies better than anybody. They just don\u2019t do that. But now there\u2019s a spirit like I have not seen. I have never seen anything like it. I mean, even the media is much more fair. I wouldn\u2019t say all of it, but that\u2019s okay. They should be fair because they should want this to end. This is \u2014 this is about death. So I want to thank Cigna and Humana. Thank you. Q Will the federal government be reimbursing those insurance companies, or is this something they really are just doing out of their pocketbooks? THE PRESIDENT: They haven\u2019t asked for reimbursement, so I assume they\u2019re not. They said they\u2019re going to waive them. Waiving them doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to waive them and get reimbursed. No. Q Okay. And second question for you, sir. First of the month is three days away. I know these cash payments are coming, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said, today, in about three weeks they should get there. For people that are worried about paying rent \u2014 I know mortgages through HUD is taken care of \u2014 but I\u2019m just curious about rent. What should people be doing for the first of the month? THE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2019re going to be getting the money. I will tell you, I think landlords are going to take it easy. We may put out a statement on that. I think a lot of people that are owed money are going to take it easy. They don\u2019t, sort of, have a choice. But a lot of concessions are made, just like the insurance companies. A lot of concessions are being made that wouldn\u2019t have even been thought of three weeks ago. Not even thought of. So, a lot of really positive things are happening. Please, behind you. Q Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday, why did you publicly threaten a quarantine on New York, New Jersey, parts of Connecticut? THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t do that at all. Read the statement. Read the statement. Read what I said. I said we\u2019re going to look into \u201cpossibly quarantine.\u201d I didn\u2019t say we\u2019re \u201cgoing to quarantine.\u201d I looked at it as a possibility, because a lot of our professionals suggested quarantine. I said we\u2019re going to look at it. We then looked at it. You see? Who are you with? Bloomberg, right? I can\u2019t imagine that. Let me just tell you, I didn\u2019t threaten it. I don\u2019t go around threatening. What happened is, people \u2014 professionals, very good professionals \u2014 love the idea of doing that, because that\u2019s sort of the ultimate in distancing. You can\u2019t do \u2014 they didn\u2019t want New Yorkers, where they\u2019re having a problem, necessarily going down to Florida where they have less of a problem. So the concept of quarantine was thrown out to me. Really, would love to do it \u2014 they would love to do it. And I thought it was too much to do, because the people are doing a great job with it. Also, it\u2019s very hard to enforce. Okay, please. Q But by speaking about it publicly \u2014 I mean, by speaking about it publicly and letting it know \u2014 be known that it\u2019s a consideration, do you think that you maybe frightened some Americans? THE PRESIDENT: No, I think we made people aware to stay in your houses and do good. Now we did an advisory. It\u2019s a strong advisor. The governors are running the advisory \u2014 the three governors: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut. And I think we did a great thing. But all I did yesterday, as you know, and you can see it. You can read it. You can read. And you can see very simply that I said that, \u201cWe are looking into it.\u201d And then before the end of the evening, substantially, we decided to go with the advisory, which frankly, I liked better from the beginning. Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. The first is, you\u2019ve said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don\u2019t actually need. You said New York might need \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say that. Q \u2014 might not need 30,000. THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say that. Q You said it on Sean Hannity\u2019s, Fox News. THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say \u2014 come on. Come on. Q You said that you might \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: You know, why don\u2019t \u2014 why don\u2019t you people act \u2014 let me ask you: Why don\u2019t you act \u2014 Q You said some states \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Why don\u2019t you act in a little more positive? It\u2019s always trying to \u201cget you.\u201d Q My question to you is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: \u201cGet you. Get you.\u201d And you know what? That\u2019s why nobody trusts the media anymore. That\u2019s why people \u2014 Q My question to you is: How is that going to impact \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. You didn\u2019t hear me. That\u2019s why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Look, let me tell you something: Be nice. Don\u2019t be threatening. Q Mr. President, my question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Don\u2019t be threating. Be nice. Go ahead. Q My question is: How is that going to impact how you fill these orders for ventilators or for masks? Your views that \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not going to impact. Q They\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re not going to \u2014 it\u2019s not going to impact you at all? THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re producing tremendous numbers of ventilators. We\u2019re doing a great job on it. Mike Pence, our Vice President, has headed up the task force, which has been incredible, the job they\u2019ve done. We have everybody in the White House working on it. We have \u2014 everybody in the country is working on this in one way or the other. The fact is, we\u2019ve done a great job of delivering. You\u2019ve seen the biggest people in the business \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s nobody even close to this group of people. We had a meeting at 3 o\u2019clock. It lasted for a long time. It was a great meeting with the generals and with everybody else. And they have done a fantastic job. I\u2019m just saying this: If they\u2019re holding \u2014 let me give you one example. We sent thousands of generators to New York. They were put into a warehouse \u2014 a New York warehouse \u2014 that happened to be located, interestingly, in Edison, New Jersey. They were given to New York, and we then went to other places, also giving thousands of ventilators. The people in New York never distributed the generators. We said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you distribute them?\u201d Now, you have to understand, they have New York people working in those warehouses. I knew they had them. So we said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you distribute them?\u201d I\u2019m \u2014 I hope they\u2019ve distributed them now. But maybe they didn\u2019t need them so badly. But just so you know, we\u2019re all \u2014 you, me, everybody \u2014 we\u2019re all on the same team. You know, when \u2014 when journalists get up \u2014 and you\u2019re a journalist, a fine journalist \u2014 Q I was quoting you directly from Sean Hannity THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 when journalists get up and ask questions that are so threatening \u2014 we\u2019re all on the same team. Q I was quoting you directly from your interview with Sean Hannity. THE PRESIDENT: Take a look at my interview. What I want to do is, if there is something wrong, we have to get to the bottom of it. When I hear facemasks go from 10,000 to 300,000, and they constantly need more, and the biggest man in the business is, like, shocked \u2014 he knows all about the virus, by the way; he\u2019s not surprised by that. He knows all about it. He shouldn\u2019t be surprised. He should say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s standard,\u201d because this is, really, a very tough disease. This is, really, a very tough virus to handle. Okay. Please, go ahead. Q Mr. President, my second question \u2014 Mr. President, my second question \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Q My second question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s enough. Thank you very much. Q But, Mr. President, my second question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Please. Please. Q My second question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s enough. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s not fair to your other reporters. It\u2019s not fair. You had a long time, a long question. It\u2019s \u2014 if we have time, I\u2019ll get back to you for your second question. Is that okay? Q Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Q Thank you, Mr. President. Just to follow up on previous questions, you said that the peak will hit in two weeks. THE PRESIDENT: Well, we don\u2019t know that, but we think the peak will hit. Q You think it will hit in two weeks. Can \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Right, that is \u2014 Q Sure. THE PRESIDENT: Our two doctors here. Q Can you just share with us your understanding of how bad it will be so the American people will be prepared for it? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can. I think I\u2019ll ask Doctor and Doctor. Maybe you could both come up and give your opinion on that, because that\u2019s really \u2014 Q And I have another question on Italy, please. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Please. DR. BIRX: Thank you. I mean, we have grave concerns when you look at the model. As I told you, look at the Chris Murray model, where he shows rapid escalation. And you can see it happening with the people we\u2019re losing every day throughout the \u2014 throughout America. And you can see it going up, just like cases. And we\u2019re starting to lose people at the same rate. And we have deep concerns about that. And I think we\u2019re meeting, and we\u2019ve had calls with the clinicians. And that has been extraordinarily helpful. I think you\u2019re watching the alerts. And we have a different population than Italy or Spain. And so because of that, our doctors and our nurses are getting information back really quickly so that they can talk to each other about how to really combat this. We\u2019re seeing things here that weren\u2019t reported in other countries. And so, I really want to appreciate \u2014 I know doctors and nurses are going full out, but they\u2019re also taking the time in their two hours of sleep to write us about what could be happening \u2014 when you see the cardiovascular disease and others. So in the model \u2014 and there\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s a large confidence interval, and so it\u2019s anywhere in the model between 80,000 and 160,000, maybe even potentially 200,000 people succumbing to this. That\u2019s with mitigation. In that model, they make full assumption that we continue doing exactly what we\u2019re doing, but even better, in every metro area with a level of intensity. Because we\u2019re hoping that the models are not completely right; that we can do better than what the predictions are. But we\u2019re tracking it very closely, and I think there\u2019s people around the United States really helping us. Scientists across the country have really given freely of their time to really help us not only model this, but really assure that the American public knows how important it is that they stay doing this. You know, you could see from the recent data \u2014 and I\u2019ll have Dr. Fauci talk \u2014 about young people that are being impacted here. We didn\u2019t see that the same way in Europe, but our population is about eight or nine years younger. And so we have to be attentive to all aspects of this \u2014 to children, to young people, to adults. We know, still, the people with preexisting conditions and the elderly are at particularly high risk, but we don\u2019t want to lose any American. And so that\u2019s why I think the President came to the conclusion that, at a minimum, we have to continue what we\u2019ve been doing, but even better. To every metro area out there, we have to do better. We have to ensure that we\u2019re protecting each other. Tony, you want to \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. DR. FAUCI: So, at the risk of offending my modeling colleagues: Models are good, but models often generate the kind of anxious question that you asked, is: \u201cHow bad could this possibly get?\u201d And as I\u2019ve said many, many times, a model is as good as the assumptions that you put into the model. And very often, many of these assumptions are based on a complexity of issues that aren\u2019t necessarily the same, as Dr. Birx said, from one country to the other. So when you give a model, you have the worst extreme, you have the best extreme. Often, the worst extreme means that you don\u2019t do anything. You just, as we say, \u201cLet it rip and let it go.\u201d If you go to the low end, that means you\u2019ve actually mitigated, really, to the utmost. So what I like to do \u2014 as a scientist, a physician, a public health official \u2014 is to not ignore models, but say look at the data as it\u2019s evolving and do everything you possibly can to mitigate that instead of getting overly anxious about the extremes of the model. Again, not to push them aside completely. But the reason the President made the announcement today about going to the end of April is because we want to make sure that we don\u2019t prematurely think we\u2019re doing so great. We may be, but we want to push it to the extreme. So, take that with you and maybe you\u2019ll be less anxious. Okay. Q Mr. President, on behalf of the foreign pool, sir, you mentioned Italy \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Just \u2014 just to finish with \u2014 Q Sure. THE PRESIDENT: So \u2014 so what both were saying, and what Dr. Fauci just brought up, we don\u2019t want to do well and then end a little bit early and have it start going up again, because that would be a disaster. Go ahead, please. Q You mentioned Italy. Italy is a close ally of the United States. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q They\u2019re facing catastrophic time. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q They have been receiving help from countries like Russia, China, even Cuba. Cuban doctors have been sent to Italy. Is the United States stepping in to \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we are. Q \u2014 help a close ally like Italy? THE PRESIDENT: In fact, I met last night with our people. We\u2019re sending them a lot of different things that we\u2019re not needing, because we\u2019re obviously in need of a lot also. And we\u2019re also helping them monetarily. We are helping Italy a lot. We\u2019re working very closely with Italy. And we\u2019re working closely with Spain too, which is really hit hard. And we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re working with everybody. I spoke with Angela Merkel the other day; Germany is hit hard. Their mortality rate is different, I think, because they do more testing. But their mortality rate is much different. Italy\u2019s mortality rate is very high, so is Spain. But we\u2019re working very closely with them. Yes, we had a big meeting on it last night. Admiral Giroir, would you please come up and just talk a little bit about the tremendous success that\u2019s been made on testing from where we started? Thank you. ADMIRAL GIROIR: Thank you, Mr. President. So, as of close of business yesterday, we have been able to perform in the United States over 894,000 tests. So, highly significantly increased every single day. Those tests are performed at a number of places: in hospitals in your neighborhood; in the public health laboratories \u2014 the state public health laboratories, and in our territories; as well as the large reference laboratories that are members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association. They have done over 650,000 tests, including over 840,000 just yesterday. I met with all their CEOs yesterday. They\u2019re fully committed to increasing testing to meet the requests and the demands of the President and Vice President. A couple words on the point-of-care test. Point of care means you stop, you get the result right there \u2014 that the President and the Vice President have talked about \u2014 by Abbott, approved in record time by Dr. Steve Hahn and the FDA. This is a point-of-care test, meaning that from the time to swab, to the time you get a positive result: five minutes, like the President said, and at most, 15 minutes for a negative result. So just think of it as a 15-minute test. This is not an esoteric test. There are 18,000 of these little toaster-size machines all over the country, in doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals right now. And Abbott will be providing 50,000, or more, tests per day starting on April 2nd, with the first shipments out already. This complements other point-of-care testing like the Cepheid test that we announced about a week ago. We also have moderate platforms. So it\u2019s not just about the number; it\u2019s the type. We have point of care. We have moderate platforms that are in hospitals and in larger clinics and academic medical centers. And then we have the very large tests. You\u2019ve heard Ambassador Birx talk about the Roche tests and the Roche platforms that are in some of these big reference laboratories. So it\u2019s not just about the number, but it\u2019s about painting this very complex ecosystem so that everybody who needs a test can get a test. On priorities, remember, we are still prioritizing those in most need \u2014 those who are in hospitals or in ICUs \u2014 because that test makes a difference to how they\u2019re being treated. Symptomatic first responders, healthcare workers, and as Administrator Verma will always say, those in long-term care facilities who are at high risk. Two \u2014 one last point: I\u2019ve learned more about nasal swabs than I ever thought I would want to learn in my entire life. But it was a very big thing that the FDA approved last week, and it will now be implemented this week. Instead of having a provider stick this all the way in the back of your nose \u2014 that\u2019s uncomfortable, but it also requires PPE changes every time it\u2019s done \u2014 the FDA approved, with lots of data supporting it, self-swab of your nose. So, literally, put a swab \u2014 a certain kind of swab \u2014 foam swab in your nose, put it in a plastic bag, give it in, and then drop it. This not only increases the speed, but it eliminates all those changes of PPE. So we will be implementing that this week, which will increase speed but also save our precious resources as we build them up in the stockpile and out to hospitals. Thank you, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Admiral, very much. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, please go ahead. Q Mr. President, you mentioned that the peak could come in two weeks. Can you ensure that everyone that needs a ventilator \u2014 every single patient that needs one will get one? Will it get there in time? And my second question is: After invoking the Defense Production Act yesterday with GM, you said that there were a couple of problem children that may require using your authority again. What are those companies? And what aren\u2019t they meeting. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t have to tell you because those companies have come into line. They\u2019re doing a great job. They\u2019re working very hard 24 hours, around the clock. So I don\u2019t want to give their names now because they are \u2014 they\u2019ve been great. They\u2019ve come into line. And, by the way, General Motors is doing a fantastic job. I don\u2019t think we have to worry about General Motors now. They\u2019ve really \u2014 they\u2019ve really done a job. And what the Admiral said also \u2014 I think we can add this, Admiral: The reason we show more cases than anybody else in the world is we\u2019re doing more testing than anybody else in the world. So we have more cases because we\u2019re doing far more testing than anybody in the world. And remember, we started with a system that was broken. For many years, it was broken. And I\u2019m not blaming the last administration. I\u2019m saying other administrations. And our pipeline had very little in it. Just like we had no ammunition, we had very little medical; we had very little in our pipeline. Now we have ammunition \u2014 more than hopefully we\u2019ll ever need. And we also have a pipeline that\u2019s packed. And now we have those 10,000 ventilators that we can use because you need some quickly. I mean, this goes quickly from place to place. I\u2019d love to give them all out right now. But we need them quickly. I don\u2019t want to give them out and then we have to take them back and move them someplace else. So we\u2019re very much prepared. Please. Q Mr. President, states like Florida have reportedly had 100 percent of their request for supplies from the National Strategic Stockpile filled, but other states like Massachusetts have not. So how is that assessment being made? And why has Florida gotten its request fulfilled? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think you\u2019re going to find that most \u2014 almost all states \u2014 look, I was on the call yesterday with the governors, and they were happy with the job we\u2019re doing. And I\u2019ll tell you what: If you had a different administration, they would not have been happy. These are people that speak their mind. They were happy. It was falsely reported by a couple of people that, \u201cOh, gee, they weren\u2019t\u201d \u2014 they were happy. They were thrilled. Florida has been taken care of and Michigan has been taken care of \u2014 a very important state. To me, it\u2019s very important because I\u2019m so proud of what we\u2019ve done, bringing car companies back into Michigan. And we\u2019re now dealing with the governor, and I think, Mike, I can say that a lot of good things are happening in Michigan. Massachusetts \u2014 we\u2019re dealing with the governor very strongly and we\u2019re trying to get things to Massachusetts as rapidly as possible. Q But why has Florida received 100 percent of its request compared to some other states? Is there a reason? THE PRESIDENT: Well, Florida \u2014 look, they\u2019re very aggressive in trying to get things, and they\u2019re doing a very good job. But I think \u2014 I think I can say all of the governors are very committed. We\u2019re very committed. We\u2019re working together. And we\u2019re getting things out at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We can \u2014 you can speak to FedEx, you can speak to UPS. You can speak \u2014 they\u2019ve never done anything like this, what they\u2019re doing right now. And nobody in the world has been able to match what these great companies have been able to do. If we left that to government, it would have been a tough thing. We have mobilized private enterprise. We have mobilized the greatest companies in the world. And what\u2019s happening is incredible, and that includes Abbott, where Abbott comes out and, all of a sudden, out of nowhere comes up with this incredible test that simplifies everything and makes it so easy. So I think you\u2019re going to find most states are very happy. I\u2019m dealing with the Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards. He\u2019s a Democrat \u2014 if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. But I\u2019m dealing with him very successfully. I think he\u2019s very happy. I think he\u2019s actually amazed at what he\u2019s been able to get. In fact, we were even forward thinking. I suggested we send additional ventilators and other things. We\u2019re building a hospital in Louisiana, very importantly. We\u2019re building hospitals in New Jersey. Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a terrific guy and, frankly, he wants \u2014 you know, he\u2019s got a pretty hot spot right there, right next to New York. And we\u2019re doing hospitals. We\u2019re doing ventilators. We\u2019re getting a lot to Governor Murphy; that\u2019s New Jersey. Q So may I ask \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Last night, I spoke to the governor of \u2014 last night, I spoke to the governor of Connecticut. We had a great talk with him. We are really doing a job. Look, Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, he\u2019s been \u2014 he\u2019s been terrific. We sent him a boat way ahead of schedule \u2014 the ship \u2014 way ahead of schedule \u2014 a hospital ship, the Mercy, with 1,000 beds, operating rooms. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been in L.A. for three days already. So I think they\u2019re really happy. And when you think about it, in New York, we built 2,900 hospital rooms, beds. Nobody has ever seen it before. The governor has never seen anything like that before. This was done by federal government, not by state government. This was done by the federal government. They\u2019re opening it tomorrow. I wanted to be there so badly but Secret Service and all of the people involved won\u2019t let me. They won\u2019t let me. I would love to be there, but they won\u2019t love me, for obvious reasons. But I would have loved to have been at the opening tomorrow of the hospital in New York, Javits Center \u2014 at Javits Center. But we\u2019re very proud of the job we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve mobilized and getting better and better every day. And the task force, headed by your Vice President, the job they\u2019ve done. And they don\u2019t even sleep. Okay, any other question? Q Sir, may I just follow up on your letter to the governors that you sent? Since we were on the topic of governors. You sent a letter to governors, at the end of the week, saying that you guys are going to be developing criteria \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 to be able to classify counties \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Yeah. Q \u2014 based on whether they were hotspots or what not. And I wanted to know if you have enough tests, currently, to be able to accurately rank those counties. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We\u2019re ranking counties and we\u2019re ranking states. And a lot of people put out false information because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. And we took over a dead, barren system. We took over a system that was obsolete. It was \u2014 it was good for a tiny, little sample of people. It was \u2014 and even that didn\u2019t work, because when CDC first looked at their test, the biggest problem they had is the test didn\u2019t work. That wasn\u2019t from us. That\u2019s been there a long time. Now we have the best tests in the world. And nobody has \u2014 now they\u2019re all calling: \u201cCan we get the quick test?\u201d We call it the \u201cquick test,\u201d where, by the way, probably more accurate and it takes a few minutes. I mean, it\u2019s pretty amazing what we\u2019ve done. No, we\u2019re getting \u2014 we\u2019re getting along great with the governors. Yeah, go ahead. Please. Q Mr. President, sir. Sir \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, go ahead. Please. Q Thank you so much, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, thank you. Q I wanted to ask you more specifically about this strategy that you plan to unveil on Tuesday. What factors are you taking into consideration? What can the American people expect? And is it possible that these April 30th guidelines could be extended? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we hope not. But we think it\u2019s going to \u2014 you know, we have aspirational thoughts. We would have loved to have been a little bit sooner, but we have to do it right. We could have done it. We could have done it on Easter, but there was a good chance that if it\u2019s coming down or if it\u2019s still going up \u2014 maybe it\u2019s going to be coming down by then. But we just felt it was too soon. We can\u2019t take a chance. You know, again, because of what we\u2019ve done and because of the fact that we\u2019ve stopped the flow from China so early \u2014 because the question is, from a lot of my friends, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we just wing it? Why didn\u2019t we just wing it?\u201d And I kept asking, and we did models now. Finally, we got these models in. And you hear about the 2.2 million people would have died. I don\u2019t mean we would have had 2.2 million cases. These are 2.2 million people who would have died. 2.2 million people. Look, we\u2019re going to have a meeting or speech or press conference or something on Tuesday. I thought what I\u2019d \u2014 I was going to announce the end of April on Tuesday, but I said let\u2019s do it now because somewhere along the line it\u2019s going to leak. We might as well just do it now and get rid of all the leaks. This way it did it nice and clean. But we have to really do a great job for another couple of weeks. And I think we\u2019re going to be in great shape. And we\u2019re going to be in a position, even with what we\u2019re trying to do with restaurants, with deductibility \u2014 we have to get these restaurants back in. We have to get our businesses open. We have to get the planes flying. We have to get everything going. We have to get even the cruise ships. I mean, we have to get those cruise ships moving along. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world, three weeks ago, and now we\u2019ve said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t work anymore.\u201d We\u2019re actually paying people not to work. Nobody has ever heard that. That\u2019s not for us. People want to work. But at the same time \u2014 and I\u2019m so glad that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx gave us a number. And the number on the outside \u2014 and maybe it\u2019s not even on the outside; we don\u2019t know \u2014 is 2.2 million people would have died if we didn\u2019t do what we\u2019re doing. And now we\u2019re looking at numbers that are going to be much, much, much lower than that. And it makes everything we\u2019re doing feel much better to me. Please, go ahead. Q Thank you, sir. I do have a question for you, but I\u2019d like to let my colleague, Yamiche, finish her second question, if that\u2019s all right. THE PRESIDENT: That would be fine. Finish it. Go ahead. Q Thanks, Jeremy. THE PRESIDENT: I was going to call on you next. You know that. Q Thank you, Mr. President. You\u2019ve also said that, at one point, that you thought more people might die from the economic tragedies and the economic problems in America due to the coronavirus outbreak. What health officials are telling you that? And, Dr. Fauci, could you speak to that \u2014 the idea that there might be mental health and suicide related to this? Would that outpace, at some point, the virus\u2019s impact on the society? Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I could ask Dr. Fauci to come up, but it\u2019s common sense. You\u2019re going to have massive depression, meaning mental depression. You\u2019re going to have depression in the economy also. But you\u2019re going to have mental depression for people. You\u2019re going to have large numbers of suicides. Take a look at what happens in a really horrible recession, or worse. So you\u2019re going to have tremendous suicides, but you know what you\u2019re going to have more than anything else? Drug addiction. You will see drugs being used like nobody has ever used them before. And people are going to be dying all over the place from drug addiction, because you would have people that had a wonderful job at a restaurant, or even owned a restaurant. I spoke to great people today that have done a great job. And one day, at the top of their business, they\u2019re celebrity chefs, they\u2019ve got the most successful restaurants, and in one day they have nothing. They\u2019ve gotten wiped out. One day, from our enemy: this invisible, horrible scourge. So when you ask me that, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s so easy to figure that. I mean, massive drug use, massive depression \u2014 mental depression, massive numbers of suicide. Anxiety causes, you know, disease, they say. A lot of people \u2014 you\u2019re going to have tremendous. And hopefully we\u2019re not going to have that, because hopefully, by what we\u2019re doing, we get the best of both worlds. We don\u2019t have 2.2 million deaths. We have a number that\u2019s much less \u2014 much, much less. And at the same time, we get our country running again. Please. Thank you very much. Q Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: You were next. He was very nice in doing it, though, nevertheless. Go ahead. Q Thank you, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Which is unusual for CNN. Q Two quick questions. First of all, during this 30-day additional period, do you anticipate at all relaxing those restrictions by region during these additional 30 days, or no? THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s a great question, actually. I don\u2019t think so. And I asked that the same. I said, \u201cHow about Nebraska? How about Idaho? How about Iowa?\u201d And you know what? Those people are so great \u2014 the whole Midwest. They want to \u2014 I don\u2019t think they want to be in that position actually. And probably \u2014 I was given a pretty strong look by these two people. They said, \u201cWe don\u2019t like that idea.\u201d So, you know, we\u2019re relying on them. They\u2019re the best in their profession, and they didn\u2019t like the idea. Q And secondly, sir, I want to ask you about some comment \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And we could do it, but I don\u2019t think it would be good. Q Thank you, sir. I would also like to ask you about some comments you made on Friday. You were talking about governors of different states, and you said, \u201cI want them to be appreciative.\u201d You also said, \u201cIf they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call.\u201d THE PRESIDENT: But I didn\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t say that. Q These are direct \u2014 direct quotes, sir. THE PRESIDENT: No, it\u2019s such a \u2014 excuse me. Ready? Ready? Ready? Take a look at what I said. I want them to be appreciative of me \u2014 okay? \u2014 and then you cut it off, because it\u2019s fake-news CNN. Q (Inaudible) of you and of your administration. Absolutely. THE PRESIDENT: Listen. Just, please, let me just finish. You just said it again, and you know the answer is a lie. Q I could read you your full comments, sir, if that would be easier. THE PRESIDENT: You know that your statement is a lie. Let me just say \u2014 look, your statement and your response and your answer is a lie, because here\u2019s the story. Are you ready? I said, \u201cI want you to be appreciative of me,\u201d and then you go on, and then I go on, and you cut it off. But it says, because when you\u2019re not \u2014 Q You said, \u201cI want them to be appreciative. I don\u2019t want them to say things that aren\u2019t true. I want them to be appreciative. We\u2019ve done a great job. And I\u2019m not talking about me, I\u2019m talking about Mike Pence, the task force. I\u2019m talking about FEMA\u2026\u201d \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q \u2014 \u201c\u2026and the Army Corps of Engineers.\u201d THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q But then you went on to say, \u201cIf they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call. He\u2019s a different type of person,\u201d you said \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t call. Q \u2014 referring to the Vice President. THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t call. No, I don\u2019t call the governor of Washington now. Q But why in this time of \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: But Mike Pence calls, and the head of FEMA calls. I don\u2019t stop them. Did I ever ask you to do anything negative, Mike, to Washington, the State of Washington? Michigan \u2014 I love that state. That\u2019s one of my favorite places in the whole world \u2014 Michigan. And I\u2019m so proud of what\u2019s happened with the auto industry; it\u2019s coming back to Michigan. No, I don\u2019t have to call because I\u2019m probably better off not, because we don\u2019t get \u2014 he\u2019s a failed presidential candidate. He\u2019s a nasty person. I don\u2019t like the governor of Washington. So you know who calls? I get Mike Pence to call. I get the head of FEMA to call. I get the Admiral to call. But what you didn\u2019t say \u2014 see, you started it off and you talked about \u201cI have to be appreciated,\u201d but then, when you read the rest, it said: Because if you don\u2019t appreciate, you\u2019re not respecting these incredible people \u2014 the two admirals. You\u2019re not appreciating FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers who built 2,900 beds in three and a half days, and you\u2019re not appreciating all of the work that\u2019s been done, and you\u2019re not appreciating these incredible people from private enterprise that are delivering things in numbers that nobody has ever seen. See, and that\u2019s why people aren\u2019t watching CNN very much anymore. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s why your ratings are no good, because you even \u2014 after knowing the truth for days now, you bring up the old lie. Read the read \u2014 the rest of your question, the rest of your statement, you didn\u2019t put in. You have to put that in. And it said in there \u201cFEMA,\u201d and it said in there \u201cArmy Corps of Engineers.\u201d Because when they disrespect me, they\u2019re disrespecting our government. And you know what? I don\u2019t mind if I\u2019m disrespected, but they can\u2019t disrespect the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. Okay. Please, go ahead. Q Why is the lack of appreciation something that\u2019s important in the midst of (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT: I want them to appreciate the incredible job we\u2019re doing. We are doing a job the likes of which has never been done before. And there are a couple of people that know that, but for political reasons \u2014 let\u2019s say they\u2019re Democrats; they don\u2019t want to give this administration credit, and that\u2019s okay. But I don\u2019t have to deal with them, but our Vice President does deal with them. Please, go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: But that\u2019s why CNN is not trusted anymore. They are not trusted. They are fake news. Remember that. Go ahead. Q We\u2019re not fake news, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Yes, you are. Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about the extension of these CDC guidelines you\u2019ve announced today \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 through the end of next month. And, of course, you know that there have been shelter-in-place orders that have been have been imposed by governors and mayors all throughout the country. And when you take that all into account, it sounds like \u2014 and it seems like you\u2019ve acknowledged \u2014 that America, essentially, will be shut down for the next few weeks, maybe even the next two months; you mentioned June 1st as a date in which you\u2019d like America to \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, we think it\u2019s going to really start to open up. We think that that\u2019s going to be the bottom of the hill. That\u2019s where we\u2019re looking at \u2014 June 1st. Maybe even a little bit sooner than that. So we have this hill. If we did nothing, the hill would have been up here. We did a lot. We did just about maximum. And we got lucky, because we stopped China from coming in, and then later on we stopped Europe from \u2014 we got lucky. We got very lucky. The people that were coming in here, they went to Italy, they went to Spain, they went to other countries. We got lucky \u2014 and they got unlucky, to be honest with you. You look at what\u2019s going on in Italy and Spain, in particular. So, no, I don\u2019t want that. June 1st \u2014 we think we can reach the bottom of that hill on June 1st. And that would be a great thing. And I have confidence in the two of \u2014 the two doctors. I think that that could be a day. It could even be sooner. Could be a little bit later; it could be sooner. But I think people would be very happy if we did a job and saved, potentially, millions of lives. I think people would be very happy with that date. Q My question, sir \u2014 I actually asked \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Yes, please. Go ahead, please. Q Sir, Mr. President, my question actually has to do with the 2.2-trillion-dollar relief bill \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 that you signed into law. In your view, do you think that another relief bill, another phase bill may be necessary? And are you prepared to support that, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m prepared to do whatever is necessary to, number one, save lives, and number two, bring our economy back strong just like it was before. I think our economy has a chance to be just as good and even better than it was before. And remember, a lot of the money that you read about, that\u2019s all coming back. These are loans to great companies that got stopped from doing business. They\u2019ll be back very soon. So much of the money that we\u2019re talking about, that money is coming back, and we\u2019ll take warrants \u2014 meaning, we\u2019ll take pieces of the company for the taxpayers of our nation. I expect that we\u2019ll make a lot of money with that money. We\u2019re going to make a lot of money, and that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t even want to talk about making money, because what I want to talk about is two things: Number one is saving lives, and number two is bringing our economy back. Okay? But I think we\u2019re going to do very well. That whole money, a lot of it is coming back. Please. Q Mr. President, thank you. Earlier this afternoon, you tweeted that there are, on average, 8.5 million Americans tuned into these daily press briefings, yet there are some networks out there that are, you know \u2014 I apologize \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 concerned about taking these briefings. THE PRESIDENT: No, I know exactly what you\u2019re saying. No, I\u2019ve read that. Q What do you say to these detractors? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019ve read that CNN doesn\u2019t want to cover them. I\u2019ve read that \u2014 except they can\u2019t help them because their ratings are so high. You know, if the ratings were low, they wouldn\u2019t be here. This man wouldn\u2019t be here. In 100 years, you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all their cameras, if they\u2019re bad, because we help their ratings. We help \u2014 we lift up their ratings because their ratings are very low. But for the most part, I haven\u2019t heard that. I will say, the Washington Post has a drive-on not to go to the President of the United States\u2019 news conference \u2014 because, frankly, so many people are watching. We\u2019re getting the word out. We\u2019re getting the accurate word out. And a lot of people are happy about it, and a lot of people aren\u2019t. But they should be happy. When I have the General, when I have Seema, and when I have Tony, and when I have our \u2014 our incred- \u2014 these are, like, people that have become big stars, okay? But they\u2019ve done a great job. But Deborah has done a fantastic \u2014 all of these people. They \u2014 they don\u2019t want to be stars. You know what they want? They want to win. They want to win the battle against the vir- \u2014 they\u2019ve been fighting this stuff their whole life, between Ebola and swine flu and \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d love your life, but that\u2019s what you like, right? That\u2019s what they do: They fight disease. And you know what? There\u2019s nobody that does it better. But I think the American public \u2014 ultimately, they should be the decider. It\u2019s like if they don\u2019t want to watch, they shouldn\u2019t watch. And we shouldn\u2019t have bigger ratings than \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d or, as the New York Times said, we have Monday Night Football-type ratings. Now, I didn\u2019t say that. I have no idea what they are, in a sense, but I know that the Times, they say it\u2019s all the news that\u2019s fit to print. I say it\u2019s all the news that\u2019s not fit to print because I think they are not honest people, but that\u2019s okay. But they can\u2019t help it. But even they said that the ratings are like Monday Night Football ratings, and that these are like \u201cBachelor\u201d finale \u2014 that\u2019s their end. When the big deal happened \u2014 I have no idea what happened because I\u2019m too busy working on this. Someday you will tell me what happened. So, no, I think it\u2019s terrible. When they don\u2019t want the President of the United States to have a voice, you\u2019re not talking about democracy any longer. Please. Thank you very much. Q Thanks, Mr. President. You\u2019ve talked a lot about concerns about leaving the economy shut down for so long. Was there any dissent from your top economic advisors in your decision to leave the guidelines in place until the end of April? THE PRESIDENT: No. No. And this is before we heard the 2.2 million people. I mean, we had a lot of people who were saying, \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t do anything. Just ride it.\u201d They say, \u201cRide it like a cowboy. Just ride it. Ride that sucker right through.\u201d That\u2019s where the 2.2 million people come in, who would have died, maybe. But it would have been 1.6 to 2.2. And that\u2019s not acceptable. But there were a lot of people that said \u2014 I thought about it. I said, \u201cMaybe we should ride it through.\u201d You know, you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We\u2019re in the midst of a bad flu season. You know, we had a bad season last year as an example. A bad flu season. And you\u2019ll have 35-, 36-, 37,000 people die, sometimes more, sometimes less. But this is different. And part of this is the unknown, and part of it also is the viciousness of it. I had a friend who went to a hospital the other day. He\u2019s a little older, and he\u2019s heavy, but he\u2019s tough person. And he went to the hospital, and a day later, he\u2019s in a coma. I call: \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d \u201cSir, he\u2019s in a coma. He\u2019s unconscious.\u201d He\u2019s not doing well. The speed and the viciousness, especially if it gets the right person, it\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s really horrible. Please, go ahead. Q Mr. President, this may be good for some of the advisors as well. We\u2019ve heard some rumors that Louisiana is really going to get hit hard next because there\u2019s a possibility with Mardi Gras. Have you guys seen any data to back that up, of what happened a few weeks ago, and whether or not that\u2019s contributing to the spike in Louisiana? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rumor. I think it\u2019s a fact. Louisiana has been hit hard. And Louisiana, as an example, it started off with like nobody for so long. I spoke \u2014 when I spoke to the governor. But Deborah or Tony? Any \u2014 either of you, if you\u2019d like to talk. DR. BIRX: You know, I think you heard us talk, about a week ago, that we were very worried about the numbers and how they were increasing in Louisiana, how they were increasing in Cook County, how they were increasing in Dearborn and Detroit. And I think those are areas that we\u2019re still watching very carefully. And like the President said, when people get this virus, some people do very poorly. And when certain metro areas get exposed to the virus, we see this really very rapid expansion of the virus. We think it may have been circulating there for, you know, a couple of weeks. We don\u2019t like to \u2014 I don\u2019t like to look backwards; I only like to look forwards. And, really, we are putting all of our effort into ensuring that the people of New Orleans, the people of the Detroit region \u2014 frankly, the people of New York. I mean, some of the fastest-growing counties are not New York itself, New York City, when you look at a per hundred thousand; it\u2019s Rockland, it\u2019s Bergen. So, I mean, these are \u2014 all of these places are people that have transited through cities, and that\u2019s why we really did want the travel advisory, just to really warn people to watch out for their own health, to really take their temperatures. And so it can go from 50, 100, 500 cases, and the next thing you know, it\u2019s 2,000, it\u2019s 4,000, it\u2019s 10,000. And because it then gets across all communities, people get very sick. DR. FAUCI: You know, you made the comment about New Orleans. This can happen anywhere, and that\u2019s really one of the issues that we\u2019re concerned about and why we were so reluctant to pull back at a time when we need to put our foot on the gas, as opposed to on the brake. And as Dr. Birx said, this is exactly what you see. There are a number of communities, cities, states, what have you, out there, in which they\u2019re trickling along like that. Don\u2019t get complacent about that because that\u2019s exactly the way the virus works. It goes like this, and then like this, and then it goes up like that. That\u2019s exactly what happened in New Orleans. That\u2019s what happened, in a terrible way, with New York. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to avoid in multiple locations throughout the country. So we shouldn\u2019t take any solace when we see low levels in different states, different cities, different areas, because they\u2019re very vulnerable to an explosion. Q And, Mr. President, last question from me, sir. I \u2014 just real quick. I asked the Vice President a week ago, and I think we talked about it last week as well. You took the test that first time. I remember that. And I think you took it last week, Mr. Vice President. Have you had a chance to take it again? Does it get easier the second time around? Does it \u2014 how are you feeling? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I haven\u2019t. I think I\u2019m waiting for that little 45-minute test. I sort of like that. Or now it\u2019s down to five minutes, I understand. But, no, I haven\u2019t. But I think I\u2019ll \u2014 I think I will take it again, if it\u2019s appropriate. I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s any symptoms. I don\u2019t notice \u2014 have you noticed any sniffles? Nothing, right? So far, I haven\u2019t felt that way. But, you know, there was a big, strong point made originally, and I think it still holds: Take the test if you need it, if you have the symptoms. If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t take it. That\u2019s put out by the professionals. So, you know, I don\u2019t have it. But I would \u2014 I would take it. I just wanted to say one thing also about what Tony had mentioned. So I grew up in Queens, New York, and right next to a place called Elmhurst, Queens. And they have a hospital that\u2019s a very good hospital \u2014 Elmhurst Hospital. Right? I\u2019ve known it. I\u2019ve known where it is. I can tell you the color on the outside, the size of the windows. I mean, I know it very well, right? That was near my community where I lived. And I\u2019ve been watching that for the last week on television. Body bags all over in hallways. I\u2019ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks \u2014 freezer trucks; they\u2019re freezer trucks \u2014 because they can\u2019t handle the bodies there\u2019s so many of them. This is in my \u2014 essentially, in my community in Queens \u2014 Queens, New York. I\u2019ve seen things that I\u2019ve never seen before. I mean, I\u2019ve seen them, but I\u2019ve seen them on television in faraway lands. I\u2019ve never seen them in our country. Elmhurst Hospital \u2014 unbelievable people. I mean, I \u2014 when I see the trucks pull up to take out bodies \u2014 and these are trucks that are as long as the Rose Garden. And they\u2019re pulling up to take out bodies, and you look inside and you see the black body bags. You say, \u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d It\u2019s Elmhurst Hospital; must be supplies. It\u2019s not supplies. It\u2019s people. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. So, we\u2019re doing \u2014 these people are doing a fantastic job. And somebody else who\u2019s doing a fantastic job is sitting here, who is the head of the task force. And I just maybe want to finish off because I\u2019d like to ask Mike \u2014 what do you think about what we\u2019ve done and where do you think we\u2019re going? And how do you feel also \u2014 and you\u2019ve studied this so closely \u2014 how do you feel about the curve and the June 1st date? And that\u2019s a very \u2014 that\u2019s aspirational. But I think that\u2019s, really, modified aspirational, because I think we\u2019re going to hit it. And maybe we\u2019ll even beat it. Okay, Mike? Please. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. And let me just join you in thanking the American people for the efforts that the people of this nation have made over the past 15 days and that we know they will continue to make over the next 30. You heard the President speak today about the modeling. And on Tuesday, he will share with the nation the full range of counsel, of the team that he assembled now months ago at the White House Coronavirus Task Force, will lay out to the country what could have been, but what we\u2019re continuing to work to make a reality. But in the meantime, every American \u2014 I think every American should have a grateful heart, first and foremost, to all the incredible healthcare workers that are on the front lines at places like Elmhurst and elsewhere every single day, as Dr. Birx said, getting just a few hours of sleep and going right back into work. I mean, they are the hands and feet of American compassion. And I want to say on behalf of your President, and on behalf of a grateful nation, that we\u2019re with you. We\u2019re going to continue to work tirelessly with these outstanding leaders at FEMA to make sure that you have the protective equipment to be able to do your job safely and go home to your family. We\u2019re going to continue to work with these incredible distributors. Literally, the aircraft that landed at JFK this morning is the first of 51 aircraft that are going to be coming in from around the world, and it\u2019s all headed to support our healthcare workers and people that are on the frontlines. But also, Mr. President, I want to say thank you to American businesses whose generosity is shining forth every day. The two insurance companies that you mentioned have waived co-pays and are providing full coronavirus coverage to Americans for the full treatment that people that are enduring this virus are experiencing. But American businesses, like those so well represented here, are stepping up every day with what the President likes to call a \u201cspirit,\u201d the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen for quite a while in this country. And it\u2019s truly inspiring. I also want to join your words about this team that you\u2019ve assembled \u2014 not only the healthcare team, the extraordinary team at FEMA and HHS, but all of our partners at the state and local level, the work that they\u2019re doing. And, Mr. President, when you tapped me to do this five weeks ago, you said: I want a full partnership with our states. I want to \u2014 I want to make sure the federal government is there working \u2014 working with our governors and all the local health officials. And to all of you who are managing your states, to all of you that are implementing those healthcare policies on the local level, you have our admiration and our commitment to continue to be with you. I think what the President laid out today, while it is \u2014 I\u2019m sure for many Americans that were hoping we would be with this sooner, there may be a modest sense of frustration and disappointment. But what I hear, speaking to these healthcare experts, is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. And that as the American people continue to put into practice the President\u2019s Coronavirus Guidelines for America \u2014 as each one of us continues to do our part \u2014 social distancing, avoiding groups of more than 10, using a drive-through at local restaurants, avoiding unnecessary travel \u2014 as every American continues to listen to your state and local leaders to heed that domestic travel advisory that the CDC issued on Saturday night, we\u2019re going to hasten the day that we get to the other side of this, as the President said. And that we truly do believe that while there are challenges in the weeks ahead, there is hope that as every American continues to put these guidelines into practice, as every single one of us continues to do our part, that we\u2019ll get through this. I mean, when the American people know the how tall the hill is, Mr. President, we\u2019ve never failed to get over it and then some. And I think with your leadership, with this extraordinary team that you\u2019ve assembled, with the great leadership that we have at the state and local levels, with the partnership with American businesses, and that can-do spirit of the American people, we\u2019ll get through this, and we\u2019ll get through this together. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much, Mike. So I just want to end by saying that we\u2019re all in this together, all of us. I have never seen anything like it. The unity, the esprit de corps, the spirit \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to watch. Unfortunately, the enemy is death. It\u2019s death. A lot of people are dying, so it\u2019s very unpleasant. It\u2019s a very unpleasant thing to go through. But the level of competence, the level of caring, the level of love, I \u2014 I just think it\u2019s brilliant, and it\u2019s possibly happening in other countries. Possibly. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t speak to other countries, but I can speak to the United States of America. And I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: I am very proud to be your President. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. END 7:13 P.M. EDT",

                              "text": "The first installment of a documentary called \u201cPlandemic\u201d stormed through social media this week, promising viewers on its website that the film will \u201cexpose the scientific and political elite who run the scam that is our global health system.\u201d The video appeared across platforms, with individual uploads each garnering hundreds of thousands of views. But the viral video, running nearly 26 minutes, weaves a grand conspiracy theory by using a host of false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus pandemic and its origins, vaccines, treatments for COVID-19, and more. The video is largely an interview with Judy Mikovits, a former chronic fatigue researcher who has lobbed a number of accusations against National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. Mikovits was an author on a controversial 2009 study linking a retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome that was published in the journal Science, and then retracted in late 2011 after labs were unable to replicate the results and other issues were brought to light. That same year, in September 2011, Mikovits was fired from her position as research director at the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada and arrested two months later after the institute alleged she stole a laptop, flash drives and other property with institute information. While Mikovits claims in the documentary that she was held in jail despite being charged with \u201cnothing,\u201d a criminal complaint from November 2011 shows she was charged with two felonies related to the stolen property. The charges were later dropped. What followed was a years-long legal battle in which Whittemore won a civil judgment against Mikovits; Mikovits filed for bankruptcy; and Mikovits alleged that Whittemore defrauded the government by misusing federally funded research materials. The latter case was dismissed this year. Mikovits recently co-authored a book with self-described \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d Kent Heckenlively, with a forward by vaccine skeptic Robert Kennedy Jr., and has spoken at events aimed at discrediting vaccines. In the video, she claims, \u201cAnd they will kill millions as they already have with their vaccines.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what vaccines she\u2019s referring to, but vaccines have been credited with saving millions of lives. For instance, according to one estimate by researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, the measles vaccine has saved more than 20 million lives across the globe from 2000 to 2016 alone. In the sections below, we break down eight of the false, misleading and unfounded claims aired in \u201cPlandemic.\u201d Unfounded Attacks on Fauci The first part of the video focuses largely on two sweeping, but unrelated, accusations against Fauci, who also has been a fixture at the White House briefings on COVID-19. Without offering any evidence, the video claims that Fauci was part of a \u201ccover-up\u201d and that he worked with other doctors to \u201ctake credit and make money\u201d on the AIDS epidemic. Filmmaker Mikki Willis sets the tone for this section of the video, saying to Mikovits, \u201cSo Anthony Fauci, the man who is heading the pandemic task force, was involved in a cover-up.\u201d Willis, a former model, has a large following on YouTube, where he has previously claimed the novel coronavirus was \u201cintentionally released.\u201d \u201cHe directed the cover-up,\u201d Mikovits says. \u201cAnd, in fact, everybody else was paid off, and paid off big time.\u201d But at no point in the video does anyone explain what Fauci supposedly covered up. We asked Mikovits in a phone interview to explain. She said it was a reference to her 2009 research paper that was later retracted. Mikovits holds Fauci responsible and claims it was part of a \u201ccover-up\u201d on the part of the medical establishment to keep hidden her research linking a mouse retrovirus to chronic fatigue syndrome. In the years since the research was first published, Mikovits has expanded its reach, suggesting that it could apply also to prostate cancer, lymphoma, and autism. The NIAID funded Mikovits\u2019 initial research related to chronic fatigue syndrome, and, after she was fired, another researcher at Whittemore was awarded the remaining grant money. But there is no evidence that Fauci, personally, had anything to do with it. And the journal that published the paper made no mention of Fauci in its retraction. Rather, it explained it was \u201cfully retracting\u201d the paper because the results couldn\u2019t be replicated, even in the same lab, and \u201cthere is evidence of poor quality control in a number of specific experiments in the Report.\u201d As for the claim about the AIDS epidemic, that goes back much further. In the early 1980s, Mikovits was working as a technician at the National Cancer Institute. She claims that the lab she was in had identified the HIV virus from blood and saliva samples and prepared a paper detailing those findings that was slated for publication. But, she says in the video, referencing one of the pioneers of AIDS research, Dr. Robert Gallo, \u201cFauci holds up the paper for several months, while Robert Gallo writes his own paper and takes all the credit.\u201d Mikovits could not provide the name of her lab\u2019s paper or the journal that was going to publish it when we spoke to her, so we couldn\u2019t check on that. But here\u2019s what we do know about the timeline for AIDS research in the early 1980s: 1981 \u2013 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an article in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report describing a rare lung infection in five young gay men in Los Angeles. Fauci would later recall seeing that article, saying in a 2011 interview, \u201cI remember putting the issue to the side of my desk, thinking, \u2018Wow, what a bizarre curiosity.\u2019 One month later, in July, a second MMWR report came to my desk, and this time, an additional 26 men had it, again all gay, all seemingly healthy, and not only in LA, but now also in San Francisco and New York City. I remember reading it very clearly. It was the first time in my medical career I actually got goose pimples. I knew something was very wrong. It changed the direction of my career.\u201d 1982 \u2013 The CDC used the term AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, for the first time. 1983 \u2013 A group of French researchers identified the virus now known as HIV. Twenty-five years later, Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier were awarded the Nobel Prize for that discovery. 1984 \u2013 A team led by Gallo at the National Cancer Institute published research showing that HIV causes AIDS. Beyond the unsupported claim that Fauci \u2014 who didn\u2019t become the director of NIAID until 1984 \u2014 stymied early AIDS research at the National Cancer Institute, Mikovits also claims that he has profited from the epidemic. Referring vaguely to patents, Mikovits says in the video that Fauci was working with other researchers \u201cto take credit and make money\u201d on the AIDS epidemic. It\u2019s true that Fauci\u2019s name appears on at least six patents related to AIDS research. But it\u2019s less clear how much he has profited from them. In 2005, the Health and Human Services Department was criticized for not disclosing how much government scientists were collecting from patent royalties. At the time, Fauci expressed concern over the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest and said that he donated all of his royalty money to charity. Scientists: Novel Coronavirus Not \u2018Manipulated\u2019 Mikovits makes a claim that numerous scientists have refuted: that the novel coronavirus \u201cwas manipulated\u201d in a laboratory and is not \u201cnaturally occurring.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s very clear this virus was manipulated, these, this family of viruses was manipulated and studied in a laboratory where the animals were taken into the laboratory,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cAnd this is what was released, whether deliberate or not, that cannot be naturally occurring. Somebody didn\u2019t go to a market, get a bat. The virus didn\u2019t jump directly to humans. That\u2019s not how it works. That\u2019s accelerated viral evolution. If it was a natural occurrence, it would take it up to 800 years to occur. This occurred from SARS-1 within a decade. That is not naturally occurring.\u201d The exact origin of the coronavirus is not known, but scientists have said the genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 indicate it was neither created in a lab nor manipulated. \u201cOur analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,\u201d said an article published in Nature Medicine in March. Instead, the authors said it\u2019s plausible that the coronavirus originated in one of two ways: \u201cnatural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,\u201d which refers to the spread of disease from animals to humans, or \u201cnatural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\u201d The authors said the possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out, but they \u201cdo not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible\u201d because they had observed \u201call notable SARS-CoV-2 features \u2026 in related coronaviruses in nature.\u201d In a statement in April, University of Sydney professor Edward Holmes, who was involved in mapping the genome of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, likewise said: \u201cCoronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 are commonly found in wildlife species and frequently jump to new hosts. This is also the most likely explanation for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d Holmes said there is \u201cunfounded speculation\u201d that a bat coronavirus named RaTG13, which was being kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was the origin of the new coronavirus. But, he explained, that is not the case, for several reasons. \u201cIn summary, the abundance, diversity and evolution of coronaviruses in wildlife strongly suggests that this virus is of natural origin,\u201d Holmes said. He added that more sampling of other animals \u201cis needed to resolve the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d Mikovits also may give viewers a false impression when she says the novel coronavirus \u201coccurred from SARS-1,\u201d which is a different coronavirus that caused a global outbreak in 2003. SARS-CoV, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is similar but distinct from SARS-CoV-2. The viruses share about 79% of the same genetic make-up, but SARS-CoV-2 is even more closely related (96%) to the bat coronavirus from which Holmes has said SARS-CoV-2 wasn\u2019t derived. We\u2019ve already written about a bogus analysis that suggested the new coronavirus could have leaked from a Chinese lab because a portion of its genome is similar to part of a viral vector that was used in previous research on SARS. Kristian Andersen, the director of infectious disease genomics at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told us in an email that analysis was \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d Misleading Claim on Wuhan Lab Funding Also on the issue of the Wuhan lab, the video shows a clip claiming that \u201c$3.7 million flowed from the National Institutes of Health here in the U.S. to the Wuhan lab in China\u201d and that NIAID \u201chad already been conducting experiments with the Wuhan lab in the past in regard to coronavirus.\u201d That\u2019s misleading. The project referenced, as other fact-checkers have previously reported, is actually funding from NIAID to EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S.-based nonprofit that researches emerging infectious diseases. The project was done to \u201cexamine the risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China,\u201d in particular the risk posed by bats, according to a 2014 description. NIH records show the project was awarded nearly $3.4 million altogether. Most of the funding was through a five-year grant awarded in 2014, Robert Kessler, an EcoHealth spokesman, said in an email to us. The group was renewed for a second five-year grant in 2019 and received $292,161 \u2014 but NIH recently terminated the grant. Of that money, only $600,000 (from the first grant) was given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Kessler said. The Wuhan lab was a collaborator that was pre-approved by NIH and the State Department, he added, and one that researchers used to conduct genetic analyses of the viruses. \u201cIn each of nearly 30 countries around the world where we work, we collaborate with local institutions, all of which are pre-approved by our federal funders,\u201d EcoHealth said in an April 28 statement about the terminated funding. \u201cIt\u2019s been EcoHealth Alliance\u2019s position for the past 15 years that coronaviruses present a clear and immediate threat to our safety. That seems clearer now than ever before.\u201d The group said its research \u201caimed to analyze the risk of coronavirus emergence and help in designing vaccines and drugs to protect us from COVID-19 and other coronavirus threats. In fact, genetic sequences of two bat coronaviruses that we discovered with this grant have been used as lab tools to test the breakthrough antiviral drug Remdesivir.\u201d So it\u2019s incorrect, and also lacks context, to claim NIAID gave \u201c$3.7 million\u201d to the Wuhan lab. Flu Vaccines Don\u2019t Contain Coronaviruses Mikovits falsely claims that \u201cif you\u2019ve ever had a flu vaccine, you were injected with coronaviruses.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s wrong,\u201d Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d \u201cThis person doesn\u2019t know what she is talking about,\u201d Dr. Lee Riley, professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us in an email, adding, \u201cI think this person is just seeking publicity.\u201d In an interview, we asked Mikovits what support she had for the claim, and she didn\u2019t provide any. She only said that flu vaccines are cultured in chicken eggs and dog kidney cells, and those animals have coronaviruses. It\u2019s an extreme leap to then claim animal strains of coronaviruses end up in vaccines tested and approved for people. Mikovits further said she attributes the spread of the novel coronavirus worldwide \u201cat least in part\u201d to the use of the flu vaccine. As we\u2019ve explained before, coronaviruses are a diverse family of viruses, and some, such as canine coronavirus, infect animals. Those aren\u2019t the same as SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. As for influenza vaccines, most are made using hen\u2019s eggs, Offit explained, and about 10% of vaccines in the U.S. are cell-culture vaccines, which use mammalian cells instead of eggs. Specifically, the process uses Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, or MDCK, cells. \u201cThese lines have been around for a long time,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThis is a well-tested \u2026 cell line that does not contain coronavirus\u201d and \u201cwould never be allowed to.\u201d On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more information on how egg-based and cell-based influenza vaccines are manufactured. A cell-based method that also used eggs at the beginning of the process received Food and Drug Administration approval in 2012, and a fully cell-based process got FDA approval in 2016. The CDC notes that once vaccines are manufactured, \u201cFDA tests and approves the vaccines prior to release and shipment.\u201d This cell-based technology has been used in other U.S. vaccines, \u201cincluding vaccines for rotavirus, polio, smallpox, hepatitis, rubella and chickenpox,\u201d the CDC says. No Evidence Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19 Mikovits also repeats the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cthe flu vaccines increase the odds by 36% of getting COVID-19,\u201d which we\u2019ve previously covered. Experts say that there has been no study linking the flu shot to elevated risk for the novel coronavirus. The military study cited by Mikovits involved four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2. More than that, the results in the study that indicate a flu-vaccinated person had an increased likelihood of testing positive for a seasonal coronavirus do not appear to be adjusted for age groups or seasons. Those factors could affect someone\u2019s chances of getting a specific virus, regardless of whether or not they\u2019ve been vaccinated for the flu. Multiple scientists have pointed out the same issue in other fact-checks, too, and have debunked the erroneous suggestion that the study looked at SARS-CoV-2. The Military Health System told us in a statement that \u201cthe study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19.\u201d MHS further said \u201cit remains essential for people to obtain the seasonal flu shot each year as it becomes available.\u201d Hydroxychloroquine: Unproven COVID-19 Therapy The video makes the unsubstantiated claim that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine is \u201cthe most effective medication to treat\u201d COVID-19, citing a survey of doctors. Shortly after that, Mikovits says hydroxychloroquine is \u201ceffective against these families of viruses,\u201d referring to the family of coronaviruses, such as COVID-19, but \u201cthey keep it from the people.\u201d We have covered this ground before when President Donald Trump encouraged the off-label use of chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Both drugs are used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. But there is only limited evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for COVID-19, and it carries potential health risks. The National Institutes of Health says there is \u201cinsufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.\u201d Despite insufficient clinical data, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization, or EUA, order on March 28 that allowed for the drugs to be used as a treatment for some hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A little less than a month later, the FDA issued a warning against using \u201chydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.\u201d The warning came a few days after a study found that patients at Veterans Health Administration medical centers treated with hydroxychloroquine had an increased mortality risk compared with those that were not treated with the drug. In the video, Mikovits says, \u201cThe AMA was saying doctors will lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug that\u2019s been on the list of essential medicine worldwide for 70 years. Dr. Fauci calls that \u2018anecdotal.\u2019 It\u2019s not storytelling if we have thousands of pages of data saying it\u2019s effective against these families of viruses. This is essential medicine and they keep it from the people.\u201d It\u2019s not true that the American Medical Association told doctors they \u201cwill lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine\u201d for COVID-19. The AMA issued a statement saying it opposed \u201cpurchasing excessive amounts\u201d of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for possible COVID-19 treatment. But it also said, \u201cNovel off-label use of FDA-approved medications is a matter for the physician\u2019s or other prescriber\u2019s professional judgment.\u201d As for hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness against coronaviruses, we have written that at least two studies show that it has antiviral activity against the novel coronavirus in cells grown in the lab. But there is only anecdotal evidence that the drug works in people. Trump cited in a tweet the results of a small clinical trial in France, but the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal in which the study appeared, later issued a statement that said \u201cthe article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\u201d We cover this more extensively in our story \u201cTrump Hypes Potential COVID-19 Drugs, But Evidence So Far Is Slim.\u201d Wrong Message on Masks In attacking public health measures taken to address the pandemic in the U.S., Mikovits wrongly suggests that using masks could lead to people infecting themselves with their own breath. \u201cWearing the mask literally activates your own virus,\u201d Mikovits said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions and if it happens to be SARS-CoV-2, then you\u2019ve got a big problem.\u201d Experts were perplexed by what she meant and said the implication that simply breathing through a mask could lead to self-infection doesn\u2019t square with science. Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne disease transmission, told us: \u201cIf you\u2019re shedding (breathing out) virus, then you\u2019re already infected. Even without a mask, infected people who are shedding virus probably rebreathe some of their own viruses, but there are already billions times more viruses in your body. Hopefully, the mask is protecting other people from your exhalations.\u201d And Lisa Brosseau, an expert on respiratory protection and infectious diseases and a certified industrial hygienist, said in an email that \u201cviruses are not \u2018activated\u2019 by anything,\u201d as Mikovits suggests. Viruses instead \u201crequire living cells in order to replicate,\u201d but their viability or ability to replicate isn\u2019t affected whether someone is wearing a mask or not, said Brosseau, a former professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. If anything, viruses in the environment can be \u201crendered non-viable by exposure to certain temperature\u201d and relative humidity conditions. \u201cThere is nothing magical about our breath that \u2018activates\u2019 or \u2018reactivates\u2019 a virus,\u201d Brosseau said. As we\u2019ve previously written, while there is little research on cloth masks, the hope is that they can help prevent individuals, even those who do not feel sick, from unknowingly spreading COVID-19 to others. Brosseau said people should frequently wash cloth masks, though, and stressed that masks are not a substitute for social distancing. The CDC notes the same. False Suggestion About Ebola Mikovits says in the video: \u201cIn 1999, I was working in Fort Detrick \u2026 and my job was to teach Ebola how to infect human cells without killing them. Ebola couldn\u2019t infect human cells until we took it in the laboratories and taught them.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what she meant by that, and she didn\u2019t explain when we asked about her claim. But the suggestion that Ebola, which includes six species of ebolaviruses, didn\u2019t infect people until 1999, or later, is false. The first two species, Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus, were discovered after outbreaks in 1976 in Central Africa. Combined, those two viruses, which scientists believe may have come from bats or nonhuman primates (such as chimpanzees, apes, monkeys, etc.), killed about 430 people that year, according to the CDC. Zaire ebolavirus \u2014 which is also linked to the largest Ebola outbreak which began in West Africa in 2014 \u2014 is said to have initially spread in 1976 through the use of contaminated needles and syringes at a hospital in the village where the first infected person was treated. And the Sudan ebolavirus is believed to have started with workers in a cotton factory. In fact, the CDC says four of the six species of ebolavirus \u2014 Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (formerly C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ebolavirus) and Bundibugyo ebolavirus \u2014 are known to cause disease in people. And three of the four species were discovered prior to 1999. A fifth species, Reston ebolavirus, was first discovered in 1989 in research monkeys imported into the U.S. from the Philippines. That species \u201cis known to cause disease in nonhuman primates and pigs, but not in people,\u201d the CDC says. There have been cases in which individuals developed Reston ebolavirus antibodies, but did not experience symptoms. The sixth species, Bombali ebolavirus, was discovered in 2018 in a bat in Sierra Leone. It also is not known to infect humans. FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

                              "text": "Donald Trump: (11:23) Thank you very much, everyone. Before I begin, I\u2019d like to offer my condolences and best wishes to the people all across our great South who have endured deadly tornadoes and other severe weather in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina. Donald Trump: (11:42) My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet. We\u2019re speaking with their governors and representatives. FEMA\u2019s already on its way and they got there. As soon as we heard the word. I said, \u201cGet out there.\u201d So FEMA\u2019s there and you know the great job that FEMA does, it\u2019s really something very special. So we just want to say warmest condolences and we\u2019re with you all the way. It\u2019s a tough deal. That was a bad, bad level five. That was a bad group. That\u2019s as high as it gets. It was a bad grouping of tornadoes, something that\u2019s something incredible, the power, the horrible, destructive power. Donald Trump: (12:26) America is continuing to make critical progress at our war against the virus. Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat. Nationwide flat. Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Louisiana. This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines. It\u2019s been incredible what they\u2019ve done. Donald Trump: (12:54) You looked at the charts, and the charts are, and the models from early on predictions were 100 and 120,000 people look like if they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish. And we\u2019re going to be hopefully way, way below that number. So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it\u2019s still just a horrible thing all over the world, 184 countries. This is attribute the wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning. We appreciate it so much. In fact, Dr. Fauci is here. Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further. Thank you very much, Tony. Please. Dr. Fauci: (13:46) Thank you Mr. President. Just a couple of things and then I just want to make a comment about something that happened yesterday. You\u2019re going to hear from Dr. Birx soon about the numbers that we\u2019ve been talking about, how things are starting to balance off. And I think the more as we go by each day, I think we\u2019re going to see, and again, I never like to get ahead of myself, or of Dr. Birx. But it looks like even though we\u2019ve had a really bad week last week, remember when I was speaking to you before I was saying this was really a bad week. There\u2019s still going to be a lot of deaths, but we\u2019re starting to see in some areas now that flattening, particularly in a place that was a hot spot like New York. That\u2019s the first thing. Dr. Fauci: (14:25) The second thing is that I had a really very, very productive conversation with the Congressional Black Caucus this morning for about an hour. And they really wanted to know what exactly are we going to be doing in the immediate, as well as the long range about the health disparities and the discrepancies both in infection and in poor outcome in the minorities in general, specifically African American. And I made it very clear to them that what we have to do is focus on getting the resources where the vulnerable are to be able to get testing done, to be able to get the appropriate identification where proper and where appropriate to isolate and contact trace if we can. But also to help mitigate in a community that is suffering and suffering much more disproportionately. So I just wanted to get that to the way. Dr. Fauci: (15:17) The other point I wanted to make is that I, I had an interview yesterday that I was asked a hypothetical question. And hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty, because it\u2019s what would have, or could have. The nature of the hypothetical question was if in fact we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved? And the answer to my question was as I always do and I\u2019m doing right now perfectly honestly say, \u201cYes.\u201d Obviously, mitigation helps. I\u2019ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works. So if mitigation works and you instigate it and you initiate it earlier, you will probably have saved more lives. If you initiated it later, you probably would have lost more lives. You initiate it at a certain time. That was taken as a way that may be somehow something was at fault here. Dr. Fauci: (16:13) So let me tell you from my experience, and I can only speak from my own experience, is that we had been talking before any meetings that we had, about the pros and the cons, the effectiveness, or not of strong mitigations. So discussions were going on mostly among the medical people about what that would mean. The first and only time that Dr. Birx, I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president to actually have a \u201cshutdown\u201d, in the sense of not really shut down, but to really have strong mitigation. We discussed it. Obviously there would be concerned by some that in fact that might have some negative consequences. Nonetheless, the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation. The next second time that I went with Dr. Birx into the president and said, \u201c15 days are not enough. We need to go 30 days.\u201d Obviously there were people who had a problem with that because of the potential secondary effects. Nonetheless, at that time, the president went with the health recommendations, and we extended it another 30 days. So I can only tell you what I know and what my recommendations were. But clearly as happens all the time, there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question that I just thought it would be very nice for me to clarify because I didn\u2019t have the chance to clarify. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:17:50]. Excuse me? Speaker 6: (17:51) The date? Dr. Fauci: (17:52) You know what, to be honest with you, I don\u2019t even remember what the date was. But I can just tell you the first and only time that I went in and said, \u201cWe should do mitigation strongly.\u201d The response was, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d Speaker 6: (18:02) And what did he do? Was that the travel restrictions? Dr. Fauci: (18:04) No. The travel restriction is separate. That was whether or not we wanted to go into a mitigation stage of 15 days of mitigation. The travel was another recommendation when we went in and said, \u201cWe probably should be doing that.\u201d And the answer was yes. And then another time was, \u201cWe should do it with Europe.\u201d And the answer was yes. And the next time, \u201cWe should do it with the UK.\u201d And the answer was yes. Speaker 6: (18:25) In this interview, you said there was pushback. Dr. Fauci: (18:27) Yeah. Speaker 6: (18:28) Where did that pushback come from? Dr. Fauci: (18:29) No, it wasn\u2019t. That was the wrong choice of words. You know what it was when people discuss, not necessarily in front of the president, when people discuss, they say, \u201cWell, this is going to have maybe a harmful effect on this, or on that.\u201d So it was a poor choice of words. There wasn\u2019t anybody saying, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Speaker 6: (18:45) Are you doing this voluntarily, or did the president [crosstalk 00:18:47]. Dr. Fauci: (18:45) No, I\u2019m doing it\u2026. Everything I do is voluntarily. Please. Don\u2019t even imply that. Speaker 7: (18:53) So Mr. President, the question is\u2026 Donald Trump: (18:55) And by the way, the travel ban, that was earlier. Travel ban was done earlier. And if you look at statistics, I happened to write a couple of them down, if you look at statistics\u2026 So on January 6th, that\u2019s long before the dates you\u2019re talking about, CDC issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, a notice before there was even a confirmed case of the virus in the United States. That\u2019s on January 6th. It\u2019s all documented because we have so much fake news, I like to document things. Donald Trump: (19:29) January 6th long before the dates we\u2019re talking about. CDC issued travel notice for Wuhan. On January 11th, we have zero cases in the United States. Zero. We don\u2019t have any cases, so there are no cases reported that we know of. This is January 11th. The CDC issued a Level 1 travel notice for health while there were still no confirmed cases. So we had zero cases. People want me to act. I\u2019m supposed to close down the economy, the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we don\u2019t have one case confirmed in the United States. That\u2019s January 11th. Donald Trump: (20:10) On January 17th to CDC began implementing public health entry screenings at three major U.S. Airports that received the greatest volume of passengers from Wuhan, at my instructions. There was not a single case of the coronavirus in the United States. So on January 17th, there wasn\u2019t a case. And the fake news is saying, \u201cOh, he didn\u2019t act fast enough.\u201d Well, you remember what happened, because when I did act, I was criticized by Nancy Pelosi, by sleepy Joe Biden. I was criticized by everybody. In fact, I was called xenophobic. I was asking Biden to please define that for me. I was called other things by Democrats. And some others, not too many others actually, by the media, definitely. Donald Trump: (20:58) Now, on January 21st this is long before the time we\u2019re talking, because when Tony\u2019s talking, I believe he\u2019s talking about the end of February. On January 21st, it was still early, there was one case of the virus at that time. We called it the Wuhan virus. Wuhan. There was one case in the whole United States. We had one case. This is all documented. It all comes from you. A lot of it comes from your people. Donald Trump: (21:27) On January 21st the CDC activated an emergency operation center. There was just one case, one person. That\u2019s why that ad was such a phony. There was one person in the United States, you see it, there\u2019s only one person, that statement was made at that time. One case in the whole United States, one case. I\u2019m supposed to shut down the government, the biggest economy in the history of the world, shut it down. We have one case. Seven cases were on January 31st. Now in January 21st there was a case, not one person had died. You heard that Steve, right? Not one person. Donald Trump: (22:08) So we have this massive country, the United States of America. We have the greatest economy in the world. Bigger than China\u2019s by a lot, right? Because of what we\u2019ve done over the last three and a half years, prior to the virus, but including the virus. So we have the biggest economy, the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had, the highest employment numbers, the best employment numbers, best unemployment numbers, also, the best of everything. So on January 31st, think of it, not one person has died. Not one. Nobody died. Not one, John, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find any. Donald Trump: (22:46) This is reported by CDC, confirmed by the news, which doesn\u2019t mean anything to me, because they don\u2019t tell the truth. But CDC reported, January 31st not one person has died. And I issued a travel restriction from China. Think of it. So nobody died. And I issued, you can\u2019t get earlier than that. So we have, nobody died. And I said, \u201cChina, you can\u2019t come in. I\u2019m sorry\u201d, because I saw what was going on. Wasn\u2019t so much what I was told, it was that I saw what was going on and I didn\u2019t like it. But I didn\u2019t speak to Tony about, didn\u2019t speak to very many people about it. I didn\u2019t like it. So what did I do? Donald Trump: (23:28) Ready? January 31st in the United States, not one person had died because of, again, the Wuhan virus, so I issued travel restrictions on that date, even though nobody died and I got brutalized over it by the press, because I was way too early. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. Brutalized by the press, but I\u2019ve been brutalized for the last four years. I used to do well before I decided to run for politics, but I guess I\u2019m doing okay, because to the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m the president of the United States despite the things that are said. Donald Trump: (24:06) So then, first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years, we did. First mandatory in 50 years. The same restrictions that the Democrats in the media called xenophobic. Now Joe Biden said he\u2019s a racist. Call me a racist, because I said, \u201cWe\u2019re shutting down entry from China. We\u2019re shutting it down.\u201d He called me xenophobic and he called me a racist and other things. Since then, on a Friday night, two weeks ago, Joe Biden issued a\u2026 It wasn\u2019t him. He didn\u2019t write it. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t even know that it was issued. Donald Trump: (24:46) But the people from his campaign who are smart, people that write these little PR releases are pretty smart, reasonably good, not the best, but they\u2019re not bad. But they issued a statement saying that Joe Biden agrees that that President Trump was right to close it down to China. Now he did that. Now he issued it on a Friday night. We\u2019ve all heard about that, John, Friday nights, right? Donald Trump: (25:07) In fact, his was later Friday night than I ever released mine on Friday nights. Okay? [Crosstalk 00:25:12] So he did it pretty late, at like at 11 o\u2019clock in the evening or something, it\u2019s pretty late. Anyway, so Joe Biden issued, and it\u2019s one of those things. But in February, Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cWe should come to Chinatown.\u201d This is late February. \u201cCome to Chinatown. We think it\u2019s very safe. Come here. Let\u2019s all have the big parade. Chinatown parade.\u201d Probably referring to San Francisco, and that\u2019s it. But I took this action early. Donald Trump: (25:42) And so the story in the New York Times was a total fake. It\u2019s a fake newspaper and they write fake stories. And someday, hopefully in five years when I\u2019m not here, those papers are all going out of business, because nobody\u2019s going to want to read them, but now they like them because they wrote about me. Now with that, I have a couple of interesting\u2026 We have a few clips that we\u2019re just going to put up. We could turn the lights a little bit lower. I think you\u2019ll find them interesting and then we\u2019ll answer some questions. I\u2019ll ask you some questions, because you\u2019re so guilty, but forget it. But most importantly, we\u2019re going to get back onto the reason we\u2019re here, which is the success we\u2019re having. OK, please. You can put it on. Thank you. Video Woman: (14:59) People should be more concerned right now with the flu in this country. Video Man: (15:01) Probably, people are concerned about the coronavirus because they\u2019re hearing a lot of news about it right now, but the reality is comparing it to the flu, for example, it\u2019s not even close to being at that stage. Sean Hannity (Video): (15:10) What if it is worse? Is this a moment where maybe countries put politics aside, a little bit of pride aside, and do we have US officials? Should US professionals such as yourself get involved? Video Woman: (15:24) How worried should Americans be about coronavirus? Video Man: (15:27) Coronavirus is not going to cause a major issue in the United States. Donald Trump: (15:39) Well, we\u2019ve asked them to accelerate whatever they\u2019re doing in terms of a vaccine. Donald Trump: (15:43) We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. Donald Trump: (15:49) To unleash the full power of the federal government through this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency. Donald Trump: (15:55) Medicare patients can now visit any doctor by phone or video conference at no additional cost. Video Man: (16:01) The first 1 million masks will be available immediate- Donald Trump: (16:03) Video Woman: (16:09) As there were more cases, and it was clear that it was spreading out of China where it originated, the president took this move that he was widely criticized for by Democrats and even some Republicans at the time, which was he halted a number of flights from China into the US. The idea was to halt the spread of the disease, keep transmissions to a minimum. He was accused of xenophobia. He was accused of making a racist move. At the end of the day, it was probably effective because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus. Andrew Cuomo (Video): (16:55) His team is on it. They\u2019ve been responsive late at night, early in the morning, and they\u2019ve thus far been doing everything that they can do. And I want to say thank you, and I want to say that I appreciate it. Gavin Newsom (Video): (17:08) He returns calls. He reaches out. He\u2019s been proactive. We got that Mercy ship down here in Los Angeles. That was directly because he sent it down here. Two thousand medical units came to the state of California, these FMS, these field medical stations, and that\u2019s been very, very helpful. Ron DeSantis (Video): (17:28) The president has been outstanding through all this. The vice president\u2019s been outstanding. Members of the coronavirus task force, very responsive. Phil Murphy (Video): (17:37) We had asked if we could have, New Jersey could have, access to a piece of the beds that are on the USNS Comfort, and the president came back, called a short few minutes before I walked in here to say indeed they would grant that to New Jersey. So that\u2019s a big step for us in addition to all the other capacity. That news is literally hot off the press, and I thank the president and vice president who were on the call together. Arizona Governor (Video): (18:02) President Trump approved Arizona\u2019s requests for presidential major disaster declaration. I want to thank the president for a quick turnaround. We requested this on a Wednesday, and we had approval by Saturday morning. And we are grateful to the administration for their continued support and responsiveness. Larry Hogan (Video): (18:25) Well first of all, I want to thank the president and the vice president for doing a really good job of communicating with all the governors. Donald Trump: (18:37) So we could give you hundreds of clips like that from governors, including Democratic, or Democrat as I call them, governors, which is actually the correct term. We could give you hundreds of clips just like that. We have them. We didn\u2019t want this to go on too long, but I just want to say it\u2019s very sad when people write false stories, like in that case, I guess it was gotten mostly from The New York Times, which is a highly\u2026 I mean if you had libel laws, they would have been out of business even before they\u2019ll end up going out of business, so it\u2019s too bad. But we could have given you some other statements. We have hundreds of statements, hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors, and if you look, they were all saying, \u201cWe need ventilators.\u201d Donald Trump: (19:27) You don\u2019t hear ventilators anymore. They have all the ventilators they need, which we were right about. We said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking for too many. You don\u2019t need that.\u201d And in all fairness, these two people right here, Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, they said, \u201cI don\u2019t think they need that many ventilators.\u201d I said, \u201cI agree.\u201d At one point, and I\u2019m not docking in New York for this, but they were asking, you remember, 40,000 ventilators. And that\u2019s more than they have all over the country, and we got them a lot of ventilators and nobody\u2019s complained. We got them, as you know, beautiful. We built hospital rooms all over the country. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, was very nice. He said, \u201cYou know what? You don\u2019t have to build the second hospital.\u201d Because good news is happening. They\u2019re not able to fill the beds. They needed two hospitals. We built one. It was perfect. We\u2019re just starting the other. Donald Trump: (20:20) I called him up. I said, \u201cDo you think we should build the second one? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d And you said, \u201cLet me get back.\u201d He got back, we didn\u2019t need it. With Governor Cuomo, in all good spirit and faith, he wanted to have the Jacob Javits Center done, and we built 2,900 incredible beds, incredible. Then we made it COVID, or to be exactly accurate, COVID-19, which was a lot of work. We had to change the duct work. We had to seal up certain areas. We had to put areas of rooftop things over the beds. We did a lot of work, and we had it\u2026 but they never really had too much use for it. And they called also, Mayor de Blasio, rightfully he called. He said, \u201cWould it be possible to get more medical help?\u201d Donald Trump: (21:10) So now not only are we building facilities, they\u2019re asking us to help because they\u2019re unable to man it. And we got him the help. We got Mayor de Blasio a lot of help. Then when the Javits Center wasn\u2019t used much, and then as you know, the Mercy, we took the Mercy and we took the Comfort. And we made them both Los Angeles and New York. We made them a COVID adaptable, which was not easy to do. And we didn\u2019t get almost any people sent there. They didn\u2019t need them at the beginning because they didn\u2019t need it for anything but this because there were fewer accidents, fewer motorcycles, fewer everything. And what we did was an incredible job, but they didn\u2019t need them. It turned out they were there, we were ready. You know the expression, they have an expression, \u201cReady, willing, and able.\u201d We were ready, willing, and able. What the Army Corps of Engineers did was a miracle. What FEMA did was a miracle. What the doctors did, so I got a call two days ago from the mayor of New York. He said, \u201cCould you help us even more with medical personnel?\u201d And we sent, I think it was 448 doctors, nurses, and respiratory experts, real experts, and I got a call from the mayor and he said, \u201cI want to tell you, incredible. These people are incredible.\u201d He said, \u201cThey lifted the spirits of the hospital workers from New York City like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d It was unbelievable, what he said was really appreciated, and I let them know that. I let the military people\u2026 He said, \u201cThey went in there so brave, so incredible. They lifted the spirits of everybody.\u201d We did all of this work, but when you read the phony stories nobody acknowledges this. Donald Trump: (22:51) And it doesn\u2019t have to be acknowledged from my standpoint, but it does have to be acknowledged from the great work that these doctors and nurses, the Army Corps of Engineers team, all these people, they\u2019ve done this incredible job. And they shouldn\u2019t be abused because you take a look at what\u2019s happened, nobody\u2019s asking for ventilators except outside of our country. Outside of our country, they\u2019re calling me. Every country, they\u2019re calling me. So many countries, and I\u2019m going to try and help them because we have thousands of ventilators being built. But nobody\u2019s asking for ventilators. Nobody\u2019s asking for beds because we built hospitals. I think we built 20,000 beds in a period of a couple of weeks. The job they\u2019ve done is incredible. With all of that being said, I\u2019m getting along very well with the governors, and if I wasn\u2019t\u2026 Mike Pence had a call today with the governors and it was like a 10. Donald Trump: (23:42) I said, \u201cHow was it?\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a 10.\u201d He used one of my expressions actually, but he said it was a 10. And I\u2019m sure you people were probably on the call, although you weren\u2019t supposed to be, but you were sitting in somebody\u2019s office listening to it because every time we have these\u2026 And you would know that for weeks those calls have been very good, but there wasn\u2019t a raised voice. There wasn\u2019t even a statement of, \u201cWe think you should do this or that.\u201d I heard it was just a perfect phone call. It might not be reported that way. They\u2019ll say, \u201cI thought that somebody maybe slightly raised\u2026\u201d Didn\u2019t even raise their voice. My only point of saying this because I want to get back to why we\u2019re here, the press has not treated these incredible people who\u2019ve done such a great job, they haven\u2019t treated unfairly. Donald Trump: (24:27) They\u2019re way off. We were way ahead of schedule, and remember this because The Times [inaudible 00:24:32] was a fake, but everything\u2026 Remember this, everything we did, I was criticized because I was too early. If I waited longer, you would have been critical. If I went way early, if I went three months earlier, I would have been criticized for being way too early. So with all of that being said, we understand it. I think I\u2019ve educated a lot of people as to the press, and I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press. Honestly, John, there\u2019d be nothing I would be more proud of if the press would work, and I don\u2019t mind being criticized. But not when they\u2019re wrong. Not when people have done a great job. Yes? Speaker 17: (25:14) Let me talk to you about the video, so I\u2019ve never seen a video like that played in this room. It looks a bit like a campaign ad. Who produced that video for you? Donald Trump: (25:23) That was done by a group in the office, and it was done just by\u2026 we just put some clips together. I\u2019ll bet you I have over a hundred more clips even better than them. They were just pieced together over the last two hours. That was just\u2026 Oh, we have far better than that. That\u2019s nothing compared to some of them. Speaker 17: (25:39) This was produced here in the White House by- Donald Trump: (25:40) Yeah, this was done by Dan and a group of people, and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hours. Speaker 17: (25:46) Why\u2019d you feel a need to do that? Donald Trump: (25:48) Because we\u2019re getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected. They\u2019re saying what a great job we\u2019re doing, these are the governors of California, governor of New Jersey, governor of New York. Look in New York, we work very close with Andrew. In New York, ventilators were going to be a problem. They didn\u2019t have a problem. We got them tremendous numbers of\u2026 thousands, but we got them tremendous number of ventilators. You don\u2019t hear ventilators are a problem. Beds were going to be a problem. I mean, I\u2019m happy about it. The Javits Center, which is incredible, is almost empty because they don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s good news, not bad news. I\u2019m not saying, \u201cGee, I wish more people were there.\u201d I don\u2019t want more people there. We brought in the boat. We brought in the Comfort, and the Comfort was originally not supposed to be for this at all, the coronavirus, was not supposed to be for that at all. Donald Trump: (26:36) They called, they said, \u201cCould we have it?\u201d That was a number of weeks ago. We said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think you need it, but if you need it, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d Then they said, \u201cCould you get the medical personnel to run the Javits Center? Could you get the medical personnel to run the ship?\u201d We said, \u201cIf it\u2019s necessary, we will, and we did.\u201d There were military personnel. That\u2019s the ones that Mayor de Blasio was so great to in terms of his statements. I mean, I really appreciated his statements. He was so impressed with them, and I am too. The level of genius and bravery, they\u2019re great people, the military people, and we pieced that together. I would say it took less than two hours. It was done in-house. Steve? Speaker 17: (27:14) But just to be clear, this was produced by government employees, by people here at the White House, this campaign-style video here? Donald Trump: (27:20) I wouldn\u2019t use the word produced. All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you. And the reason they did is to keep you honest. Now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work. It\u2019s not going to have any impact, but just think of it. You heard the clips, you heard what I said. They said I acted late on closing down the country. Some people wish we never closed it down. Now if we didn\u2019t, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people interestingly, so I\u2019m against it. We did the right thing. Everything we did was right. If we would have closed down- Speaker 17: (27:48) There\u2019s going to be dangerous [inaudible 00:27:49] along the way here. You think everything you did was right? Donald Trump: (27:51) Well look, governors should have had ventilators. They chose not to have them. We were able to get them ventilators. You haven\u2019t heard other than there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, \u201cWe want ventilators.\u201d They got the ventilators. You don\u2019t have that anymore, and the surge is supposed to be coming now. And if they do need ventilators, John, we\u2019ve got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock. We have people standing with those ventilators right now. If you needed 2000 in New York, which you don\u2019t, but if you did, we can have them here in less than 24 hours. We\u2019re ready to rock. [crosstalk 00:28:24] This was a great military and beyond that operation. Let\u2019s get back to the regular. Well shouldn\u2019t we get back to the regular? Donald Trump: (28:31) We can talk about this, but all I\u2019m doing is this, I could have given you\u2026 Those are four or five clips that we just played for you, I could have given you hundreds of people. Gavin was on television two days ago with one of your competitors singing praise. The question was asked in a negative way. He said, \u201cLook, I know what you want me to say, but he\u2019s been really good. It\u2019s hard for me to say that. In fact, it\u2019s impossible for me to say.\u201d Donald Trump: (29:02) Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. I have many clips. I have some clips from Anthony that I didn\u2019t want to put up, which were really good. I think Anthony would be the first one to say when I closed the country to China, the China ban, whatever you want to call it, Anthony said I saved a lot of lives by doing that. I mean, am I correct? I don\u2019t want to put words in Anthony\u2019s mouth, by the way, and I like him. Today I walk in, I hear I\u2019m going to fire him. I\u2019m not firing him. I think he\u2019s a wonderful guy. [crosstalk 00:00:29:32]. I retweeted somebody, I don\u2019t know. They said fire, doesn\u2019t matter. Speaker 17: (29:41) Did you notice that when you retweeted it? Donald Trump: (29:41) Yeah, I notice everything. Speaker 18: (29:44) So you retweeted it even though it said time to fire Fauci? Donald Trump: (29:46) Well, no, that\u2019s somebody\u2019s opinion. All that is is a opinion. Speaker 18: (29:49) But you read it, and you elevated it. Donald Trump: (29:50) Well, I was called about that. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not firing.\u201d In fact, if you ask your friends in the public relations office, I was immediately called upon that, and I said, \u201cNo, I like him. I think he\u2019s terrific.\u201d Because this was a person\u2019s view. Not everybody\u2019s happy with Anthony. Not everybody\u2019s happy with everybody, but I will tell you, we have done a job the likes of which nobody has ever done. The mobilization, getting of equipment, all of the things we\u2019ve done, nobody\u2019s ever done a job like this. We have 50 governors and territories, by the way, people don\u2019t ever mention that. We have territories. We have 50 governors and territories, and many of those governors are Democrats. And they can\u2019t find anything to complain about, and honestly, many of them didn\u2019t do their jobs. I\u2019ll let you know someday. Let\u2019s see what happens, but I may let you know who\u2019s not doing their job. Donald Trump: (30:41) I can tell you the ones that are good, both Republican and Democrat, and the ones who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. But we help some of the ones that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They should have had their own stockpiles, and now if they want, we can build them stockpiles of ventilators. The hardest thing is the ventilator because it\u2019s expensive. It takes a while to get. We got them and nobody believed we did. Now, many of the governors were asking for far too many, and we said they were asking for far too many. We talked and we said, you said very strongly that they just don\u2019t need that, but you said they don\u2019t need that many beds, Deborah. So that\u2019s it. Go ahead. Speaker 19: (31:18) [inaudible 00:31:18] you and Dr. Fauci are on the same page? Donald Trump: (31:21) Yeah, we have been from the beginning. I don\u2019t know what it is exactly, but if I put somebody\u2019s opinion up, I don\u2019t mind controversy. I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing, but I want it to be honest controversy. Now, when I got a call, I got a call not very quickly, and nobody saw that as being any big deal. They said, \u201cHow are you doing with Dr. Fauci?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m doing great,\u201d and I didn\u2019t talk to Dr. Fauci even until we just got here. Dr. Fauci asked one of the people if he could get up and speak, and he did. [crosstalk 00:31:53] And they totally misinterpreted him. I saw what they did. Speaker 18: (31:56) Can I ask you, he said the question was hypothetical, but what he was just acknowledging is that lives would have been saved if the mitigation practices were put into place earlier. Speaker 18: (32:03) That seems obvious. Do you not agree with that? Donald Trump: (32:06) Here\u2019s the thing. Now what he really is saying though, but how could you have done it? Look, I just went over stats with you, right? Here, right here. How do you close it up? You have no deaths and no cases, on January 11th. Doctor, would you recommend closing the United States of America? Oh, this must be terrible. How many cases do we have? None. How many deaths do we have? None. January 17th, go back another week. On January 17th, this is 10 days before I did the, little bit less than 10 days, before I did the ban. I did a ban on China. You think that was easy? I then did a ban on Europe and a lot of people said that was an incredible thing to do because you look at Spain, and by the way, we\u2019re doing very well because when you look at all of those flat graphs and you add it all up, the United States is very low. Donald Trump: (32:54) And per capita we\u2019re very low. We\u2019re doing very well. But how do you close up the United States of America? So on January 6th, no deaths. On January 11th, no deaths, and no cases. On January 17th, no cases, no cases, no deaths. I\u2019m supposed to close up the United States of America when I have no cases. Speaker 21: (33:16) You didn\u2019t close down until the middle of March. Should you have closed it down earlier? [crosstalk 00:33:19]. Donald Trump: (33:19) I closed down from China. Excuse me, I closed it down from China. And by the way, some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out. I disagree with them, okay? But it was thought of. I mean, that was an alternative. You know, there are a lot of people that would\u2019ve said, \u201cLet\u2019s ride it out.\u201d Now, I\u2019ll give you the good news. If I would have done that, it would have been, I think, catastrophic, because their numbers are, Anthony, 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have died if we tried to do that. And I did this last time, cut it in half. Donald Trump: (33:54) Don\u2019t say 2.2 million. Cut it in more than half, say a million people died. Well, that\u2019s much more than the Civil War. Cut it in half. Take the million and cut it in half. That\u2019s 500,000 people would have died. Now that number we would\u2019ve reached, okay? That would have been easy to reach if we did nothing. So we did the right thing and our timing was very good. But here\u2019s the one thing, and you have to say this. When you asked me, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do this?\u201d How come when I did the ban on China, and instituted some very tough things, how come Nancy Pelosi, a month later, is in Chinatown saying, \u201cLet\u2019s all march. This is not going to happen.\u201d How come we have many of the experts from CNN and many other networks, if you call CNN a network, I don\u2019t personally, but we have CNN, we have many other places, and they\u2019re all saying he doesn\u2019t need to do it. He doesn\u2019t need to do it. Donald Trump: (34:50) All I\u2019m saying is this, how do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world, when on January 17th, you have no cases and no death. When on January 21st, you have one case and no death. One case, think of that. Now we\u2019re supposed to close down the country? But here\u2019s what happened. When on January 31st, I instituted the ban, Joe Biden went crazy. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need the ban.\u201d He didn\u2019t go crazy. He didn\u2019t even know what the hell the ban was, so he didn\u2019t go crazy. But he did say, [crosstalk 00:35:24] he did call me xenophobic, wait a minute, he called me xenophobic. He called me a racist because\u2026 He has since apologized and he said I did the right thing. Donald Trump: (35:34) So when you say, why didn\u2019t you do this? Every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I did it. I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives [crosstalk 00:35:43] by him. Speaker 22: (35:44) What did you do with that time that you bought? The argument is that you bought yourself some time. You didn\u2019t use it to prepare hospitals. You didn\u2019t use it to ramp up testing. Right now, nearly 20 million people are unemployed. Donald Trump: (35:50) You\u2019re so disgraceful. It\u2019s so disgraceful the way you say that. Let me just, listen. I just went over it. Speaker 22: (35:57) Tens of thousands of Americans are dead. How is this [crosstalk 00:35:57] or this rant supposed to make people feel confident in an unprecedented crisis? Donald Trump: (35:59) I just went over it. Nobody thought we should do it, and when I did it- Speaker 22: (36:06) But what did you do with the time that you bought? The month of February. That video has a gap, the entire month of February. Donald Trump: (36:10) You know what we did? What do you do when you have no case in the whole United States? Speaker 22: (36:15) You had cases in February. Donald Trump: (36:18) Excuse me. You reported it. Zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th- Speaker 22: (36:23) January, February, the entire month of February. Donald Trump: (36:25) I said in January. Speaker 22: (36:25) That video has a complete gap. Donald Trump: (36:27) On January 30th- Speaker 22: (36:28) What did your administration do in February for the time that your travel ban bought you? Donald Trump: (36:33) A lot. Speaker 22: (36:33) What? Donald Trump: (36:33) A lot, and in fact, we\u2019ll give you a list. What we did, in fact, part of it was up there. Speaker 22: (36:37) It wasn\u2019t. Your video had a gap. Donald Trump: (36:37) We did a lot. Look, look, you know you\u2019re a fake. You know that. Your whole network, the way you cover it is fake, and most of you, and not all of you, but the people are wise to you. That\u2019s why you have a lower approval rating than you\u2019ve ever had before times probably three. Speaker 22: (36:53) 20 million people are unemployed. Tens of thousands are dead. Donald Trump: (36:54) And when you asked me that question, let me ask you this, why did Biden apologize? Why did he write a letter of apology? Speaker 22: (37:03) I don\u2019t think anyone in this room cares about why Joe Biden didn\u2019t apologize to you. Donald Trump: (37:03) No, that\u2019s very important. Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly? You know why? Because they really thought that I acted too quickly. We have done a great job [crosstalk 00:05:12]. Now I could have, I could have kept it open and I could have done what some countries are doing. They\u2019re getting beat up pretty badly. I could have kept it open. I thought of keeping it open because nobody\u2019s ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America. But if I would\u2019ve done that, we would\u2019ve had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead. We\u2019ve done this right, and we really have done this right. The problem is the press doesn\u2019t cover it the way it should be. Go ahead. One more question, Steve. Go ahead. Speaker 23: (37:47) There\u2019s a debate over what authority you have to order the country reopened. What authority do you have? Donald Trump: (37:53) Well, I have the ultimate authority, but we\u2019re going to get into that in a minute. We\u2019re going to just finish this up. We\u2019re going to tell you about other things that we\u2019ve done right, but I will say this, had we said, \u201cLet\u2019s just keep going and let\u2019s not do a closing,\u201d whether it\u2019s 2.2 that they at one point predicted as an outside, or 1.6 at a lower number, you cut it all the way down to six or seven or 800,000, take just a fraction of the number that could have happened, it literally would have been more than the Civil War. It would have been a disaster. So the minimal number was 100,000, and I think, I feel pretty good that we\u2019re going to be substantially below, Anthony, the hundred thousand, and I hope we will. Donald Trump: (38:33) All right, so today the Department of Health and Human Services announcing five new contracts to procure large numbers of additional ventilators under the Defense Production Act, which we used a lot by the way, which you didn\u2019t like to talk about, in addition to the 1,300 we received today. We received today 1,300 additional ventilators. Donald Trump: (38:55) Now we\u2019re probably not going to need them, but we can add that to our stockpile, which is very big and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge. We\u2019re ready to rock. The contracts are with General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, Resmed, and VIAIR combined with the DPA contracts that we announced last week with General Motors and Phillips, and two other contracts with Hamilton and Zole, we\u2019re adding 6,190 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile of which we have a lot already, thousands, close to 10,000, but this will be added by May 8th, another 29,000 by the end of May, and more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year. Now we\u2019re going to help other countries. We\u2019re going to help states if they need it. We may help some state stockpile. Donald Trump: (39:49) You know, they\u2019re supposed to buy their own stockpile. They have state stockpiles. They\u2019re supposed to be using that and unfortunately most of the states weren\u2019t there, and a lot of people didn\u2019t want to talk about it, but they weren\u2019t there. We will talk about it the right time if you want to. I, at this point, I\u2019m more focused on getting past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic, anything you want to call it. We got to get past it. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. Think of that. You know, you heard all about ventilators, ventilators, we need ventilators, because they didn\u2019t have them, because the states should\u2019ve had them. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. No one who has needed a hospital bed has been denied a hospital bed. That\u2019s not even really our responsibility. Donald Trump: (40:34) Now if we can help, we\u2019re going to do it, but that\u2019s where the Army Corps of Engineers did such a great job. We built over 20,000 beds. In fact, we built thousands more than we\u2019ve actually needed to be safe. We wanted to be safe, and they rose to this incredible occasion. I mean, we built more beds than we thought. We thought in Louisiana, we were going heavy. And again, when I called the Governor, I said, \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t build that second hospital because we don\u2019t want to build it if you don\u2019t need it.\u201d He called back, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need it.\u201d They had a thousand rooms, a thousand beds, and they used a lot of them, but they didn\u2019t need the other ones, so we stopped it because we don\u2019t want to waste. But we\u2019re prepared to build thousands more, should we need it. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need it because it looks like we\u2019re plateauing and maybe even in many cases coming down. Donald Trump: (41:21) In addition, we\u2019ve ordered a total of 16 mobile decontamination systems. So the decontamination is system from Battelle, Ohio, is an incredible thing because it takes the masks and up to 20 times you can decontaminate a mask. And I\u2019ve been asking from the beginning, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we sterilize and sanitize these masks?\u201d And it turned out we can, and there was a great company in Ohio. They sent us some great equipment and they\u2019re doing that now, and now we\u2019re going to have more than 33 million N95 masks per week will be cleaned, decontaminated, and it\u2019ll be great. It\u2019s something that frankly, I think people should have thought of a long time ago. Donald Trump: (42:07) Five more flights landed today as part of the Project Air Bridge, our massive airless lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the United States, which has now delivered nearly half a million N95 masks, 370 million gloves, 25 million surgical masks and 4.9 million gowns. So we have millions of gowns, gloves, masks, all surgical equipment coming in should the states need it. Now the states are supposed to be buying their own stuff, but should they need it, we are ready to give them because we\u2019re building up our stockpile again like crazy. Donald Trump: (42:44) Remember, and you saw the stories, I inherited this administration, Mike, myself, the whole administration. We inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare. There was nothing, and I say it and I\u2019ll say it again, just like we didn\u2019t have ammunition, we didn\u2019t have medical supplies, we didn\u2019t have ventilators, we didn\u2019t have a lot of things that should have been had, and you can read your own stories on that because you know what happened. They didn\u2019t want to spend the money, but we did. To date, we\u2019ve facilitated the supply of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide. This week we\u2019ll be sending two million N95 masks to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Vice President will go into more detail. He\u2019s got great detail on that and I think it\u2019s a pretty amazing story. We have a lot of masks already in stock and we have more coming. Donald Trump: (43:35) We\u2019re further expanding hospital surge capacity in key areas of the opening, and we have a portion of certain VA hospitals and non-veteran coronavirus patients including at the East Orange New Jersey Medical Center as well as facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn. They\u2019re ready, they\u2019re able, they\u2019re beautiful. Hopefully we won\u2019t need too many of them because frankly we built everything that the governors wanted and in many cases it\u2019s too much. We told them it was too much, but we wanted to err on the side of caution. Donald Trump: (44:06) The United States has now conducted nearly 3 million tests for the virus, 3 million, the most of any nation. We\u2019re performing approximately 115,000 tests every single day, and our rate of testing is especially high in areas hardest hit by the virus. If you look, and it\u2019s hit some areas of the virus, very, very hard. For example, per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world. The NIH, CDC and FDA are also currently validating several antibody tests that will allow us to determine whether someone has already had the virus and potentially become immune to infection. We\u2019re looking at that. The antibody tests are going to be very interesting over the next short while. A lot of things are being developed as we speak. Donald Trump: (44:54) In the race to develop effective treatments, the drug company Gilead announced that its drug Remdesivir has shown promising results, very promising in compassionate use settings. In addition, the FDA has just granted Emergency Use Authorization for a device that removes certain proteins from the bloodstream, possibly preventing a patient\u2019s immune system from overreacting to the virus and damaging vital organs, which is a big problem. Donald Trump: (45:23) Furthermore, over the last seven days, my administration has deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from our national stockpile. We have millions of doses that we bought and many people are using it all over the country. And just recently a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that drug. So, who knows? And you combine it with Z-Pak, you combine it with zinc depending on your doctor\u2019s recommendation, and he\u2019s having some very good results. I\u2019ll tell you, I think of anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place, to be honest with you. I think the fact that I recommended it, I probably set it back a lot. But it\u2019s a lot of good things are happening with it, a lot of good tests. Donald Trump: (46:07) Scientists are also pursuing a blood therapy known as a convalescent plasma, convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat those who are sick, and this is something that actually is a very old procedure, but it\u2019s done in a very modern way. During this difficult time, we\u2019re also working to ensure that the 2020 census is completed safely and accuracy. We may be asking for an extension because obviously they can\u2019t be doing very much right now. They wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to do it. So the census, we\u2019re going to be asking for a delay, a major delay, I think. How can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now? The Census Bureau recently made the decision to temporary suspend its field operation data collection activities to help stop the spread. In addition, while millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online, the Census Bureau has asked Congress for a 120 extension. Donald Trump: (47:07) I don\u2019t know that you even have to ask them. This is called an act of God. This is called a situation that has to be, they have to give, and I think 120 days isn\u2019t nearly enough. My administration\u2019s also taking bold action to help American workers. On Friday, Americans began receiving the cash payments authorized by a historic $2 trillion relief bill. By the end of the week, nearly 80 million Americans will receive a total of $147 billion and from what the Secretary of the Treasury tells me, that\u2019s very much on time and going very nicely. He\u2019ll be speaking in a moment. In payments, these payments go directly into the banks and the bank accounts of these people. Millions of additional payments will follow. The typical family of four will receive $3,400, that\u2019s for a family of four. That\u2019s something. Additionally through our paycheck protection program, which is a tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase- Donald Trump: (48:03) \u2026 tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase it. This has been a tremendous success. So successful that the banks should take it a little bit longer to distribute the money, but it\u2019s going rapidly. Donald Trump: (48:12) We\u2019ve now processed over $200 billion in loans to help small businesses retain their workers. Now we urgently need lawmakers to set aside the partisan agendas and to replenish this program with new funds, because it\u2019s really something that has been an incredible success and they need more money to keep it going, to take care of these business and keep them open. Donald Trump: (48:35) I want to thank the many governors, health professionals, scientists, and business leaders for their incredible hard work and input over the past month. And even long beyond a month, Mike, I would say. We\u2019ve been working together with a lot of them for it seems like forever. Donald Trump: (48:50) I\u2019ve been having many discussions with my team and top experts. We\u2019re very close to completing a plan to open our country, hopefully even ahead of schedule. That\u2019s so important. We will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states. My administration\u2019s plan and corresponding guidelines will give the American people the confidence they need to begin returning to normal life. That\u2019s what we want. We want to have our country open, we want to return to normal life. Our country\u2019s going to be open. It\u2019s going to be successfully opened. We\u2019ll be explaining over a very short number of days exactly what is going to be. Donald Trump: (49:35) We\u2019ve also, as you probably heard, developed a committee. We\u2019re actually calling in a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields. We\u2019ll be announcing them tomorrow. Donald Trump: (49:49) This weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC-Plus. That\u2019s OPEC plus additional energy producing nations, representing many of the world\u2019s largest oil producing countries to stabilize all markets. We have, in fact, and I think you\u2019ve seen, a big stabilization over the last couple of days. Together, countries around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrels. People are saying 10 million, but we think that the number that they\u2019ll actually hit is going to be closer to 20 million barrels a day. That will help a lot with saving jobs all over Texas, and Oklahoma, and North Dakota, and many other of our big energy states. Donald Trump: (50:33) This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the US oil and gas industry. It\u2019s a very monumental agreement. I want to thank Saudi Arabia and the king of Saudi Arabia, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, both. I want to thank President Putin of Russia. And I want to thank a very good friend of mine, man who\u2019s become a friend of mine, the president of Mexico showed great flexibility. President Lopez Obrador. He showed great flexibility and tremendous intelligence doing what he did. It was not that easy for him, and I want to thank Mexico and the president. This is a very historic deal, very historic, so we\u2019ll see how it all goes. Donald Trump: (51:18) In this time and challenge, and we are certainly in a time probably like we haven\u2019t been in many, many decades, we are strengthened and sustained by the bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans. I\u2019m so proud of the American people. Everywhere you look, you see the patriotism of our people shining through, and the courage of our doctors and nurses on the front lines, and the dedication of our food supply workers, and in the commitment of every citizen to achieving victory over the virus. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to happen sooner than people think. Donald Trump: (51:54) We\u2019re going to be smart about it. Very, very smart about it. We\u2019re going to be safe about it. We\u2019re going to be listening also to the great doctors and medical professionals. Together, we\u2019re beating back the invisible enemy, and we\u2019re paving the way for great resurgence. It\u2019s really a great resurgence, the American prosperity. Our country wants to go back. They want to go back to work. They\u2019re going to go back safely. That\u2019s what we want. Donald Trump: (52:18) I\u2019d like now to ask Vice President Pence to say a few words, followed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. I think before we do this, because I know there\u2019s an emergency where they want Steve to come. So what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll ask Steve to come up, secretary of the treasury. You can talk a little bit, and then maybe take a couple of questions about what\u2019s happening. Tell them the success we\u2019re having. Thank you very much. Steven Mnuchin: (52:45) Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. As you announced, we are very pleased that we are ahead of schedule on delivering the economic impact payments. These were what was known as the checks in the mail that we want to deliver in direct deposit. This is ahead of schedule. We started processing those last Friday. We expect that over 80 million hardworking Americans will get the direct deposit by this Wednesday. We know how important that is to all of those hardworking Americans, many of which are at home, not working at the moment. Steven Mnuchin: (53:20) If you do not receive them by Wednesday, on Wednesday, we will be launching at irs.gov, click on irs.gov, go to \u201cGet your payment.\u201d If you filed a tax return in 2018 or \u201919, have that information available. You\u2019ll be able to ID yourself. You\u2019ll be able to put in your direct deposit information, and within several days, we will automatically deposit the money into your account. We want to do as much of this electronically as we can. It\u2019s very important in this day and age. It\u2019s more secure, and you don\u2019t have to go to the bank. Steven Mnuchin: (53:56) If you are a social security beneficiary, you do not need to do anything. You will get a direct deposit. If you have not filed and did not need to file a 2018 and \u201919 return, you can go to irs.gov now, and enter your information and authenticate yourself. Again, we are very pleased that that is ahead of schedule. Steven Mnuchin: (54:18) I\u2019d also like to announce the progress we\u2019re making on the new SBA program, the PPP. Let me just remind everybody, this is a brand new program that is now one week old. We have distributed and confirmed 230 billion of loans to over 4,600 lenders participating. That is multiples and multiples of anything that the SBA has ever done in one year before. I especially want to thank the broad-based community banks that are participating. Again, over 4,600 banks. If you haven\u2019t had your loan processed, you will get it processed this week. As the president said, we\u2019ve gone back to Congress and asked them for more money to make sure that every business has access to this. Steven Mnuchin: (55:08) Let me also comment for the states. We are distributing out half the money this week to the states. That\u2019s a week ahead of time. We\u2019ll deliver the other half of the money to the states next week. Steven Mnuchin: (55:19) Then let me just finally comment, we\u2019ve been working very closely with the Federal Reserve. Last week, we announced expanded facilities and new facilities that total $2.3 trillion of liquidity. In particular, I\u2019d just like to highlight a main street lending facility that will be for companies between one worker and 10,000 people, so mid-size businesses. Also, a municipal facility for states and local governments to be able to access funds, given the shortages that they have. With that, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Donald Trump: (55:54) Do you have any questions for Steve, press? Speaker 24: (55:55) Secretary Mnuchin. Thank you, sir. Both Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer have said that they\u2019re in negotiations with you right now on additional funding for these small business loans, that package. Leader McConnell though has said that nothing should be added to the package. They should just be specific to small business loans. What is the opinion of your administration? Should there be some sort of horsetrading here, or should it just be small business loans? Steven Mnuchin: (56:24) The president\u2019s view, and the vice president\u2019s, and my view is this was a bipartisan program. This SBA program, it wasn\u2019t a Republican program, it wasn\u2019t a Democrat program. It was a bipartisan program. We\u2019ve committed to small businesses. We should top up that program now. I know the Democrats want to talk about more money for hospitals and states. Right now we\u2019re just sending the money out to the hospitals and states. They haven\u2019t come close to using that money. Steven Mnuchin: (56:50) I know the president and vice president have said, once we get the SBA done, we can go into a another funding bill. The president\u2019s talked about potentially adding infrastructure and other things. We think there is a likelihood we will need more money. We will sit down and try to get a bipartisan bill. But this is important we deliver on small businesses. 50% of the people work for small businesses. Speaker 24: (57:13) Thank you, sir. Speaker 25: (57:14) What\u2019s the emergency that the president said you had to go for? The president said you had an emergency- Donald Trump: (57:20) Negotiation. Speaker 25: (57:21) Over this bill? Steven Mnuchin: (57:22) Yeah. Well, because we don\u2019t want to run out of money. We\u2019ve used about 220 billion of the 350 billion. We don\u2019t want to run out of that money. We don\u2019t want to create panics that people won\u2019t get it. That\u2019s why we want to top that up, and we\u2019ve asked for another 250 billion for that program. Steven Mnuchin: (57:40) Again, let me just remind you, every dollar we spend in this program, we save a dollar of unemployment insurance. Even though we\u2019re asking for 250 billion, it really won\u2019t cost that much. Speaker 25: (57:52) Could I follow up? Speaker 26: (57:52) Do you have concerns about lifting the guidelines too soon? I mean, what\u2019s the economic impact? I understand the economic argument for getting people back to work, obviously. But what\u2019s the economic risk of lifting them too early and seeing a spike in cases again? Steven Mnuchin: (58:07) Well, of course there\u2019s economic risks in both directions. We reviewed with the president today a very broad list of over a hundred business people that are going to help advise the president on what needs to be done to reopen the economy. We want to make sure, and again, the combination of economic impact payments, small business payments, enhanced unemployment insurance. The president made very clear, we want to make sure that hardworking Americans have liquidity while we wait to reopen the government. Speaker 27: (58:37) Do you believe the country, excuse me, should be reopened on May 1? Steven Mnuchin: (58:41) I\u2019ve had discussions with the president. I know he\u2019s considering it. I believe he\u2019s going to make a decision later in the week. Donald Trump: (58:47) Everything has to be safe. We want safe. Speaker 27: (58:48) What is your advice to the president? Steven Mnuchin: (58:50) My advice is as soon as it\u2019s ready to open, and based upon the medical professionals\u2026 Again, we\u2019re working very closely with the president and outside business leaders to develop a plan. Speaker 28: (59:00) [crosstalk 00:59:00] ask you, Mr. President. If you could sketch for us what reopening the economy looks like, do you think it\u2019s going to be everything open or do you think- Donald Trump: (59:09) Well, I\u2019ll be doing that over the next few days, because we\u2019ll probably be making a statement about that and exactly what it looks like. I know what that looks like, but I also want to get the advice, in a sense. We have some of the biggest from every business on this council. We\u2019re actually setting up a number of different councils or committees, I guess you could call them. We have a lot of smart people. I think that they will give us some also good advice. But no, we want to be very, very safe. At the same time, we\u2019ve got to get our country open. Speaker 29: (59:41) Mr. President. Speaker 28: (59:41) I don\u2019t understand though, Mr. President. Do you think there is a possibility then that what you do is you open it incrementally? Do you think people would go back to restaurants, concert, the cinema- Donald Trump: (59:49) I do think so. Eventually, they will. Yeah. We hope so. Speaker 28: (59:52) Let me ask one final- Donald Trump: (59:53) I think eventually they will do that. I think we\u2019re going to boom. I think it\u2019s going to go quickly. Our people want to get back to work, and I think there\u2019s a pent up demand like there hasn\u2019t been in a long time. Speaker 28: (01:00:05) [crosstalk 01:00:05]. Steven Mnuchin: (01:00:05) One other- Donald Trump: (01:00:06) That\u2019s why you see the stock market\u2026 I mean, to think that the stock market\u2019s at the level it is right now with all that this world and this country has gone\u2026 And look at the European Union, how badly decimated they\u2019ve been. Look at other countries. Look at China, by the way. I\u2019ve seen the numbers. Look at China. Look at how these countries have been just decimated by this. And to think that the stock market is at this tremendously high number. Not that much\u2026 It was looking a little bleak for a while, but it hit a certain point and then started going up. I think that\u2019s a great tribute to the fact that there\u2019s a demand. Yeah. Speaker 24: (01:00:39) Mr. President, thank you, sir. In regards to some of your tweets earlier today, and I think it was Steve\u2019s question, my question to you is what provision in the Constitution gives the president the power to open or close state economies? And then- Donald Trump: (01:00:54) Numerous provisions. We\u2019ll give you a legal brief if you want. Speaker 24: (01:00:58) We\u2019ll be looking forward to that, sir. But following up, what happens if you say, for instance, we want states to reopen, but California or New York do not open, what would you do then? Donald Trump: (01:01:08) Well, I think everybody wants to open. I mean, I guess- Speaker 24: (01:01:09) [crosstalk 01:01:10]. Speaker 28: (01:01:11) Sorry, could I just ask one other thing on the- Donald Trump: (01:01:12) I guess that could happen, but I don\u2019t think that would happen. Speaker 29: (01:01:13) Mr. President [crosstalk 01:01:14]. Speaker 30: (01:01:13) The states that have closed, ordered schools closed, it\u2019s been states that have ordered businesses like restaurants and bars and place- Donald Trump: (01:01:21) That\u2019s because I let that happen, because I would\u2019ve preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up. But I let that happen. I like the way they\u2019ve done it. Donald Trump: (01:01:29) The seven that remained, really, in sort of a semi-lockdown, if you look at those states, they\u2019ve really done a very good job. They\u2019re very much different from a New York or from other places where they\u2019ve been hit very hard. Go ahead, please. Speaker 31: (01:01:39) So you\u2019re prepared then to [crosstalk 01:01:40] states and say, \u201cI order you to open your schools. I order you to force kids to be able to go.\u201d? Donald Trump: (01:01:44) Go ahead, please. Speaker 32: (01:01:45) Yeah. Yes, Mr. President. Following up on that, there are two consortiums of states today, California, Oregon, Washington on the West Coast, Northeastern states, totally representing about a hundred million people, who said they\u2019re going to cooperate and decide when to reopen those states. Donald Trump: (01:02:00) Well they can decide, but- Speaker 32: (01:02:01) Does that undermine what you\u2019re trying to do? Donald Trump: (01:02:03) No, not at all. Let me just tell you very simple. I\u2019m going to put it very simply. The president of the United States has the authority to do what the president has the authority to do, which is very powerful. The president of the United States calls the shots. If we weren\u2019t here for the states, you would have had a problem in this country like you\u2019ve never seen before. We were here to back them up, and we\u2019ve more than backed them up. We did a job that nobody ever thought was possible. It\u2019s a decision for the president of the United States. Donald Trump: (01:02:31) Now, with that being said, we\u2019re going to work with the states, because it\u2019s very important. You have local governments. They\u2019re pinpointed. It\u2019s really, you talk about\u2026 It\u2019s like a microchip. They\u2019re pinpointed. We have local government that hopefully will do a good job. If they don\u2019t do a good job, I\u2019d step in so fast. But no, they can\u2019t do anything without the approval of the president of the United States. Speaker 33: (01:14:21) So if some States refused to reopen and you ordered them to, the 10th amendment of the constitution says all powers that don\u2019t reside in the president of the Congress reside in the states, how do you overcome that? Donald Trump: (01:14:30) Well if some states refuse to open, I would like to see that person run for election. They\u2019re going to open. They\u2019re going to all open. Speaker 33: (01:14:37) [crosstalk 01:14:37] the ballot box, I think that \u2013 Donald Trump: (01:14:38) That\u2019s something that\u2019s not going to happen. They want to open. They have to open. They have to get open. Every one of those states, the people want to go and they want to \u2026 Now, some will be, are in a different situation. You have, I won\u2019t name states now, but I will over the next two or three days. I\u2019m going to be very specific, but you have some states where this is not the kind of a problem than it is in New York or Louisiana or Michigan or other places that got hit very hard. Illinois got hit very hard, but all states want to open and they want to open as soon as possible, but they want to open safely and so do I. Yeah please. Speaker 34: (01:15:15) Thank you, Mr. President. Today, the French president, Emmanuel Macron , said that he will keep the shutdown down in France till the middle of May. Does that mean that the US will keep the ban of flights from New York? Donald Trump: (01:15:26) No, France got hit very hard. France got hit very hard and again, he has to do what he has to do. He\u2019s a friend of mine, but France, Spain has just been decimated. You look at what\u2019s happened in Italy, it\u2019s a very well known fact what happened in Italy. No, they were hit very hard. Speaker 35: (01:15:43) Question for secretary Mnuchin. Has everybody that you would like to have, the 100 business people on the economic council, have they all been invited already? Have they all agreed to [crosstalk 01:15:51]? Steven Mnuchin: (01:15:52) They haven\u2019t been invited yet. We just reviewed the names with the President today [crosstalk 01:15:55]. Speaker 35: (01:15:56) And are they from all sectors? Energy- Steven Mnuchin: (01:15:57) Yes. Basically there\u2019s vertical, so every single area of the economy, we want it to be represented. Speaker 35: (01:16:03) Great. One other thing. Is there anything else needs to be done to work on industry, oil industry jobs to save oil industry jobs after the deal this past weekend? Steven Mnuchin: (01:16:12) Well, I think there\u2019s always things. So we\u2019re working with Larry Kudlow. We have- Speaker 35: (01:16:15) Anything specifically that needs to be done? Steven Mnuchin: (01:16:16) We have economic plans for every single part of the economy. Obviously in the case of the oil industry, they\u2019ve been hit especially hard because you\u2019ve had both the supply issue and you\u2019ve had the demand issue. Speaker 28: (01:16:30) Have you figured out the bail-out money for the airlines, the allocations for the airlines? Steven Mnuchin: (01:16:33) So I\u2019m pleased to say we\u2019ve worked very hard. I think as you probably have seen, we put out a press release that we have now had discussions with almost all the airlines. I\u2019ve personally had discussions with all the major airline CEOs. We specifically created an exception for small airlines that we could process very quickly and I think you\u2019ll see, very quickly, decisions coming out. I\u2019m very pleased with the discussion we\u2019ve had. Donald Trump: (01:16:59) We\u2019ve had very good [inaudible 00:13: 00]. Speaker 36: (01:17:01) Mr. Secretary? Steven Mnuchin: (01:17:02) Yes. Speaker 36: (01:17:02) Do you still see a need for a Phase Four stimulus or is it just [crosstalk 01:17:04]- Donald Trump: (01:17:04) Steve I just want to say we have had discussion- Speaker 36: (01:17:06) [crosstalk 01:17:06] with that? Donald Trump: (01:17:06) Excuse me one second. We\u2019ve had very good discussions with the airlines. Very good discussions. Speaker 28: (01:17:12) Is it possible to reopen the economy on May the 1st? Donald Trump: (01:17:15) I don\u2019t want to say that. You\u2019ll be hearing over the next few days. Speaker 36: (01:17:18) [crosstalk 01:17:18] do you still see a need for a Phase Four this push in lieu of another stimulus? Steven Mnuchin: (01:17:25) Okay. So again, let me just comment. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, approved an unprecedented amount of money to help American workers and American business because it was no fault of their own that business was closed down. We have been very diligently executing on that. Everybody said it was going to take months to get people money. We are executing very quickly. We created a whole new SBA program in a week. Our job right now is to execute the 2.3 billion, which we can add several trillion dollars with the Fed. Steven Mnuchin: (01:17:59) The one area we are particularly concerned about is the small business program. Quite frankly, it\u2019s even more incredibly popular and successful than we anticipated. So the President wants to be very clear. We have money for that and once we get done with that, we will review with the President. If there is more money that needs to be to support this economy, to support hardworking Americans, we will work with Congress to get that in time. Donald Trump: (01:18:22) And Steve, do you want to talk about Phase Four? Steven Mnuchin: (01:18:25) So Phase Four, the President has talked about infrastructure for a long period of time. We\u2019ve talked about to the extent that the hospitals need more money because of the medical issues, we\u2019ll monitor that. We want to make sure there are incentives for restaurants, entertainment, people to get back to those types of things. So we\u2019ll be looking at very specifically provisions to stimulate parts of the economy. Some of them may be money issues, some of them may be regulatory issues. Speaker 37: (01:18:55) [crosstalk 01:18:55] just to clarify your understanding of your authority vis a vis governors. Just to be very specific. For instance, if a governor issued a stay at home order- Donald Trump: (01:19:06) When you say my authority, the president\u2019s authority, not mine, because it\u2019s not me. This is when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to be. Speaker 37: (01:19:17) It\u2019s total. Your authority is total? Donald Trump: (01:19:19) It\u2019s total. It\u2019s total- Speaker 37: (01:19:19) What part of the [crosstalk 01:19:19]. Donald Trump: (01:19:20) And the governors know that. Speaker 37: (01:19:21) So if a governor- Donald Trump: (01:19:22) The governors know that. Now you have a couple of bands of- Speaker 37: (01:19:24) [crosstalk 00:15:24]- Donald Trump: (01:19:24) Excuse me, excuse me. Speaker 37: (01:19:25) Could you rescind that order? Donald Trump: (01:19:26) You have a couple of bands of Democrat governors, but they will agree to it. They will agree it. Speaker 37: (01:19:34) What does the authority cover? Donald Trump: (01:19:35) The authority of the President of the United States having to do with the subject we\u2019re talking about is total. [crosstalk 01:19:41]. Yeah please go ahead. Speaker 30: (01:19:43) One of the things you spoke we saw in your video about was the travel ban from Europe. As part of reopening America, do you want to reopen the borders so that people from Europe, from the UK- Donald Trump: (01:19:56) At the right time. Speaker 30: (01:19:57) How soon [crosstalk 01:19:57]- Donald Trump: (01:19:58) A very good question actually. Well, I would have to take a look. I wouldn\u2019t say Italy\u2019s doing great right now and I wouldn\u2019t say Spain\u2019s doing great right now and we just heard that France is extending its stay inside order. They\u2019ve extended it. I just see that and I think for short period of time, but no. When they\u2019re back, we want to do it very quickly, but we want to make sure everything\u2019s good. No, right now we have a very strong ban. We\u2019re going to keep it that way until they heal. Speaker 30: (01:20:24) Weeks, months? What would you- Donald Trump: (01:20:26) Well, I can\u2019t tell you that. I have to see. How are they doing? France just went for another two weeks. We have to see. John. John: (01:20:32) So Dr. Fauci said that you took his advice on the question of mitigation. He made the recommendation, you accepted and you put it into place. As you make this next decision which you have said- Donald Trump: (01:20:41) Well, I\u2019m not sure who \u2026 John, I\u2019m not sure who really gave me advice on the ban. I think I took my own advice on the ban. I don\u2019t know. John: (01:20:50) Not the ban [crosstalk 01:20:50] the social distancing, I\u2019m talking about, the shutting down, not of travel, but of activity. So my question is, as you make this next decision, which you have said maybe the most difficult or important decision of your presidency, will you assure the American people that you will again take the advice of the doctors of Dr. Fauci, of Dr. Birx? Will you take the advice of the health experts before you do that? Donald Trump: (01:21:13) I will and many other people also, but I will absolutely take their advice. Please go ahead. John: (01:21:18) Would you go against their recommendation if they say you need another 15 or 30 days- Donald Trump: (01:21:20) I don\u2019t think it would be likely because I think we\u2019re not very far from being on the same page. Please. Speaker 38: (01:21:26) Yes, Mr. President. One thing that Governor Cuomo said today is that states do not have the capacity to do mass COVID-19 testing ahead of a reopening [crosstalk 01:21:36]- Donald Trump: (01:21:36) Well, they have to do it. [crosstalk 01:21:37] supposed to be [crosstalk 01:21:38]. Speaker 38: (01:21:38) They can\u2019t purchase the diagnostic tests or equipment and needs federal help. So will the states get that? Donald Trump: (01:21:42) They may need help but- Speaker 39: (01:21:43) Will they get it? Donald Trump: (01:21:43) But they\u2019re there. They\u2019re on ground. They\u2019ve got local mayors, local representatives. They have people that do it- Speaker 38: (01:21:50) But needs the supplies. Donald Trump: (01:21:50) And what we did last time is unprecedented. We literally rebuild tests. We rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing. What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say. Not only were the cupboards bare as I say, but we inherited broken testing. Now we have great testing. I just left the top executives at Abbott. Who would have thought that would have happened where they have such a great test as that? Donald Trump: (01:22:18) And in fact what I\u2019ll do, I think unless you have any further questions for the Secretary of Treasury, do you have anybody for Steve? Anybody? Is that for the secretary of the treasury or for me? Because if it\u2019s for me, we can wait. Speaker 27: (01:22:28) It\u2019s for the secretary [crosstalk 01:22:28]. Donald Trump: (01:22:29) We have to get him back to work okay? Speaker 27: (01:22:30) Yes sir. For Secretary Mnuchin, I have a question from one of my colleagues who\u2019s not able to be in the room. They\u2019re curious about the SBA rule that prevents small casinos from getting some of this relief. Is that something that you\u2019re taking a look at? Is there going to be a change [crosstalk 01:22:48]? Steven Mnuchin: (01:22:48) Not small casinos, but there are such things as small taverns and restaurants that have literally small gaming things, and we are coming out with some additional guidance on that. But I want to be clear, it\u2019s not small casinos. Speaker 27: (01:23:02) Thanks sir. Speaker 39: (01:23:03) Secretary Mnuchin? Speaker 40: (01:23:04) Secretary? Steven Mnuchin: (01:23:04) Yes. Speaker 40: (01:23:05) There was a letter that some house Republicans sent this weekend about the liquidity for mortgage service owners. Steven Mnuchin: (01:23:11) Yes. Speaker 40: (01:23:11) Can you explain what you\u2019re looking at in that front? Steven Mnuchin: (01:23:14) Sure. So I think I commented on this a week or so ago. We had a sub committee task force at FSOC that specifically studied this issue. We have all the appropriate people on it. Ginnie Mae has automatically taken some action. We\u2019ve had conversations with the FHFA as to what they\u2019re going to do for Fannie and Freddie. And we\u2019ve said that to the extent they need certain authorities from the treasury, we will accommodate that. So we\u2019re very aware of the issue. Quite frankly, we\u2019ve been studying this issue way before COVID and had concerns about some of these non-bank servicers not being well-capitalized, but we\u2019re going to make sure that the market functions properly. Speaker 27: (01:23:54) Thank you sir. We have seen in a number of these relief bills that Democrats and Republicans have been able to push forward different non coronavirus specific funding priorities. Are you trying to keep funding specific to coronavirus and then if there are going to be other additions, for instance a change to labor rules is something that many on the left wanted. Some on the right are wondering if they should also, if you should also be pushing for their preferred add-ons. Steven Mnuchin: (01:24:24) I think our expectation has always been this is COVID related. Some people have a rather broad view of what COVID related is because it has impacted almost every single business. I think we\u2019ve, the President has talked about the Kennedy Center, which is a good institution. Obviously that was not the major priority of the bill, but they were hit with COVID related. So, but no, the President instructed we want to be very specific in the next bill, it\u2019s COVID related items. Donald Trump: (01:24:52) [crosstalk 01:24:52] it\u2019s been reported with the Kennedy Center just so you understand and that was done \u2026 The Democrats wanted it and we didn\u2019t want that, but they wanted it in and we had to agree in order to get something done for the workers. But we want this to be for the workers and for companies that employ the workers. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re not looking for extraneous nonsense. Speaker 27: (01:25:11) You argued that at the time of that the China man was being discussed, that was too disruptive to the global economy. Was that accurate? Steven Mnuchin: (01:25:18) Let me be clear. I had nothing to do with the China ban. I wasn\u2019t on the task force at the time. I\u2019m not even sure I was \u2026 I think I was traveling at the time, but I never had any \u2026 I was not part of \u2026 I did become very active in after the China ban, but that report in the New York Times was not accurate. I was not part of the task force at that time and I was not involved. Matter of fact, I think I may have been traveling. Speaker 32: (01:25:41) A proposal by Senator Hawley to get direct payments to employers to pay people who\u2019ve been laid off and to keep people on payroll. Does administration support that proposal? Steven Mnuchin: (01:25:57) Again, that is the PPP. The PPP is basically sending money to small business, 50% of American workers, to keep those people paid and it\u2019s the most efficient way. Every dollar, as I said, we do through that, it\u2019s one less dollar of unemployment and more importantly, we want those people to be associated with the business so as soon as the President is ready to open up the economy, those businesses are together. We don\u2019t want those businesses to fall apart. That\u2019s why this is such a successful program [crosstalk 00:22:26]- Donald Trump: (01:26:26) But are you talking about the unemployment or you\u2019re the unemployment? Speaker 32: (01:26:28) [crosstalk 01:26:29]- Donald Trump: (01:26:30) Sending it indirectly to the states. We would have preferred that it was sent directly to the people. The Democrats wanted it to be sent through the unemployment system. And I\u2019ve talked to you about it, we have 40-year-old equipment in many of those systems that run by the state, but I\u2019m hearing to getting the money out anyway. Steven Mnuchin: (01:26:47) So some of them are and some of the states aren\u2019t, and we encourage \u2026 We\u2019re working with the states to try to update their computers, but it\u2019s a long haul. [crosstalk 01:26:55] thank you. Thank you Mr. President. Donald Trump: (01:26:58) Phase Four Steve. Phase Four. Come on Steve. Speaker 29: (01:27:01) A quick question on something you just said. You said when someone is President of the United States, their authority is total. That is not true. Who told you that? Donald Trump: (01:27:10) You know what we\u2019re going to do? We\u2019re going to write up papers on this. It\u2019s not going to be necessary because the governors need us one way or the other, because ultimately, it comes with the federal government. That being said, we\u2019re getting along very well with the governors and I feel very certain that there won\u2019t be a problem. Yeah please, go ahead. Speaker 29: (01:27:28) Has any governor agreed that you have the authority to decide when their states [crosstalk 01:27:32]? Donald Trump: (01:27:32) I haven\u2019t asked anybody because- Speaker 29: (01:27:34) That no one is [crosstalk 01:27:34]- Donald Trump: (01:27:36) You know why? Because I don\u2019t have to. Go ahead please. Speaker 29: (01:27:36) But who told you the president has the total authority? Donald Trump: (01:27:36) Enough. Please. Speaker 41: (01:27:40) You mentioned the Vice President\u2019s call with the governor\u2019s today. Governor Hogan of Maryland has urged your administration to ask Congress for 500 billion to help stabilize budgetary shortfalls created by coronavirus. Donald Trump: (01:27:52) It\u2019s nice to have Governor Hogan very much. We appreciate Governor Hogan\u2019s statement. Speaker 41: (01:27:56) Governor Cuomo said the CARES Act ignored state government [crosstalk 01:27:59] shortfalls. Do you [inaudible 01:28:01] that request and [crosstalk 01:28:02]- Donald Trump: (01:28:01) Which one? Where is it? Speaker 41: (01:28:03) He said the CARES Act ignored the budgetary shortfalls. Donald Trump: (01:28:08) Well, they\u2019re looking at things in Phase Four where they talk about states and they\u2019re also talking about hospitals. They\u2019re talking about States who have been battered and they\u2019re also talking about hospitals and we\u2019re certainly willing to look at that. Speaker 41: (01:28:21) Will you urge Congress on their behalf? Donald Trump: (01:28:22) We\u2019ll see what we all come back with but they are talking about states and they\u2019re talking about hospitals. [inaudible 00:24:29]. Speaker 42: (01:28:29) Thank you Mr. President. Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has on Thursday signed an executive order banning the sale of non-essential goods. If other states follow her- Donald Trump: (01:28:39) The sale of what? Speaker 42: (01:28:40) Non essential goods. She has banned the sale of non essential goods. Many are calling this draconian, unconstitutional. As president, do you think that if other states were to follow her example in the coming weeks that the federal government should intervene? Donald Trump: (01:28:56) Well I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. I think it\u2019s very extreme, but she\u2019s doing it and I think it\u2019s going to be over a long way before we have to start thinking about it too much. It is strong. It\u2019s a very strong position to take, but they\u2019re making a lot of progress in Michigan, so let\u2019s see how it all works out. Speaker 28: (01:29:12) What is the status of the funding for the World Health Organization? Donald Trump: (01:29:15) We\u2019re going to be talking about that very soon. I\u2019m getting a full report. I\u2019m not happy with the World Health Organization. Not happy with the World Trade Organization either. We\u2019ve been ripped off by everybody. We have, this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it\u2019s the World Health or World Trade. They\u2019re like, I call them, the Bobbsey Twins. They look at our country, for years and years, we had people that did nothing about it. We\u2019re doing a lot about it. So we\u2019ll have a report and we\u2019ll also, we\u2019re also talking about the World Trade Organization, but we\u2019ve made a lot of progress there. We\u2019re now winning cases for the first time because they know I\u2019ll leave if we don\u2019t get treated fairly. Donald Trump: (01:29:52) This country, our country, was at a point where we\u2019ve rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization, but now we\u2019re winning a lot of them because they know I\u2019m not playing games. We will pull out if we have to. We just won a $7 billion lawsuit, which was very nice. Speaker 28: (01:30:11) Do you expect a decision this week on cutting funding for the WHO? Donald Trump: (01:30:14) Yeah. I would say by the end of the week, I\u2019m going to make a decision, yeah. Right now there\u2019s a lot of things happening. Go ahead. Speaker 36: (01:30:21) From China, why are there no consequences for China for the misinformation that they shared- Donald Trump: (01:30:27) How do you know that there are no consequences? Speaker 36: (01:30:28) Well, you\u2019ve been asked and it appears that they\u2019re weren\u2019t- Donald Trump: (01:30:28) How do you know that there are no consequences? Speaker 36: (01:30:29) What are the consequences Mr. President of the misinformation- Donald Trump: (01:30:30) I wouldn\u2019t tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you? Speaker 36: (01:30:34) But people are concerned that they stone-walled [crosstalk 01:30:35]- Donald Trump: (01:30:35) No, you started off by saying why are there no consequences? Speaker 36: (01:30:39) But you\u2019ve been asked this a few times, [inaudible 01:30:39]. Why are there no consequences for China? Donald Trump: (01:30:41) How do you know that there are no consequences? Speaker 36: (01:30:43) Because we\u2019ve asked you and said- Donald Trump: (01:30:44) You\u2019re going to find out. Speaker 36: (01:30:45) You\u2019ve said [crosstalk 01:30:45]. Donald Trump: (01:30:45) I wouldn\u2019t tell you. You\u2019d probably be the last person on earth I\u2019d tell. Speaker 36: (01:30:48) So you\u2019re saying there was no consequences? Donald Trump: (01:30:49) Go ahead. Yeah, please. Speaker 37: (01:30:51) Mr. President, actually this is a question for Mr. Vice President. Do you agree with the President\u2019s statement and his understanding of federalism that his power is total in a way that he described it? Is there anything you\u2019d like to add or any context you\u2019d like to add to the way he was discussing that? Mike Pence: (01:31:07) I support the president\u2019s leadership under the national emergency declaration that he signed. We\u2019re standing before you today, the first time in American history, when all 50 States have issued emergency declarations and the territories. This is an unprecedented time in the life of the nation. Unfortunately, as the President\u2019s reflected and our health experts will continue to reflect, because the American people have heeded the President\u2019s coronavirus guidelines for America, because state governors have taken those and implemented them even in States where there was not a significant outbreak, and implemented additional measures as we provided them with data about cases and best practices, we\u2019re making real progress as a country. But make no mistake- Speaker 37: (01:32:00) [crosstalk 01:32:00] more circumscribed than total. Mike Pence: (01:32:03) Well, make no mistake about it. In the long history of this country, the authority of the President of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. You can look back through times of war and other national emergencies. And as the president said, we\u2019ll happily brief that. But in the days ahead, what the president\u2019s charged us to do is to work with our health experts. We\u2019re going to bring together an extraordinary group of American business leaders to council the president. And then working with the CDC, we\u2019re going to produce new guidelines based upon the data for every state and territory in this nation. We\u2019re going to give them guidance and as the president\u2019s indicated, we\u2019ll continue to respect the leadership and partnership that we\u2019ve forged with every governor in America, but this is an unprecedented time. Mike Pence: (01:32:58) But I have to tell you, when you look at the fact, despite the heartbreaking loss of more than 22000 Americans, when you look at the fact of what the health experts told us this could be, I think I only can feel a sense of gratitude to the American people, gratitude to the extraordinary team that has counseled this President, the steps of President Trump has taken, the policies that governors have implemented all across America. We were discussing today at the task force that when you look at the European Union as a whole, they have nearly three times the mortality rate that the United States of America has today, and that is a tribute to our extraordinary healthcare workers, their dedication, their tireless work. But it\u2019s also a tribute to the fact that the American people put into practice the mitigation efforts that the President counseled the nation to do on the advice of our best scientists now more than a month ago. And our hospitals were not overwhelmed and are not overwhelmed at this hour. Mike Pence: (01:34:09) And I have to tell you, standing here today, I couldn\u2019t be more proud to stand alongside this president and to be a part of this team that has served the American people during this challenging hour. And I\u2019ll just say to you, to every American looking on, as we see the numbers leveling and maybe even beginning to go down, I just encourage you to keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Because of the sacrifices that Americans and American families have made through these mitigation efforts, you\u2019re saving lives and you\u2019re seeing our nation through this time. Speaker 43: (01:34:46) Sir, did the States tell you, you\u2019ve been talking to the governors quite a bit. Did those coalitions of states on the West coast and in the Northeast, did they tell you what they were going to be announcing before they announced it? Mike Pence: (01:34:59) Governor Phil Murphy and the Governor of Connecticut expressed today that they were going to be speaking on and discussing on a regional basis what their recommendations would be. And we assured them today- Speaker 43: (01:35:11) [crosstalk 01:35:11] house about that though sir? Mike Pence: (01:35:11) We assured them today on our conference call with I think 48 governors that were with us today for the better part of an hour and a half, we told them that what the president would be producing is directed to be produced are additional guidelines for the states, certified by the CDC, that would inform those governors and local communities and mayors about the best way forward based on the unique circumstances that those states and those communities are facing. Mike Pence: (01:35:43) I think what\u2019s clear is the American people have seen the experience in Washington State, where this really all began for us, and in California, and now the extraordinary challenges in the greater New York City area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, the challenges in New Orleans and Louisiana and Detroit, still Chicago- Mike Pence: (01:36:02) \u2026 New Orleans and Louisiana and Detroit, still Chicago, parts of Houston, but they\u2019re also seeing that in each one of those cases that the mitigation efforts are truly working. So we\u2019ll work with those States, and in some cases it\u2019ll make perfect sense for them to work together on a regional basis. Speaker 44: (01:36:20) But you know ahead of time what they were planning? Donald Trump: (01:36:22) [inaudible 01:36:24]. Mike Pence: (01:36:24) The president will be \u2026 Donald Trump: (01:36:26) You don\u2019t know that yourself. Mike Pence: (01:36:26) I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear your question. Speaker 44: (01:36:28) Can you tell us? Did they let you know? Donald Trump: (01:36:29) [inaudible 01:36:31]. Mike Pence: (01:36:29) I didn\u2019t hear what you said. I\u2019m sorry. Donald Trump: (01:36:30) We would like to have their cooperation, and we are going to have that cooperation. They will cooperate perfectly. Watch. Mike Pence: (01:36:42) Let me just affirm what the president said. We heard it again today in what I think was our ninth conference call with governors is I think every American would be proud to see the partnership that this president has forged with governors across the country. It is an extraordinary statement, and you\u2019ll see some data when Adam Polowczyk gets up in just a few moments, but the flow of resources from around the world that we\u2019ve moved into areas that have faced challenges \u2026 I mean, this president has directed us to ensure that every state has what they need, when they need it. The spirit that I heard again from republicans and democrat governors today was reflective of that partnership, and as we move forward to the president\u2019s goal of reopening America, we expect the same kind of partnership in the interest of the nation. Donald Trump: (01:37:31) All right, go ahead. Speaker 45: (01:37:34) Sir, if you can hear me through the mask. Donald Trump: (01:37:37) Barely. I hear you well. Speaker 45: (01:37:39) The District of Columbia argues that they were short changed in the most recent funding bill, because they were treated as a territory instead of as a state. Will that be made right in phase four? Donald Trump: (01:37:52) Well, we\u2019re looking at that certainly. I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we\u2019ve done, and she was on today saying very good things. Okay, yeah. Go ahead in the back. Speaker 46: (01:38:03) Mr. President, you talked about this being the most difficult decision that you\u2019re going to have to take about whether to reopen the economy. I wonder how much it weighs on your mind the thought that if there is a second wave, you\u2019ve reopened the economy and you might have to shut things down again. Donald Trump: (01:38:20) It does, and I hope that won\u2019t happen. I certainly hope that won\u2019t happen, but it does weigh on my mind. Okay, in the back. Go ahead. Go ahead, yes. Speaker 44: (01:38:26) Mr. President? Donald Trump: (01:38:29) Go ahead. Speaker 47: (01:38:33) Thank you. A question for one of my colleagues who wasn\u2019t able to be here. China deployed an aircraft carrier to the South China Sea this weekend amid claims by Chinese state media that COVID has reduced U.S. military readiness in the region. What kind of responses are you thinking of? Will you have a response to this action? Donald Trump: (01:38:57) China has their own difficulties. We have a relationship with China that we\u2019re not happy with certain things that happened over the last period of time, as you know, and I\u2019ve been very explicit on that, but we know all about that and know China is \u2026 We\u2019ve seen what they did. We\u2019ve seen many other things that they\u2019ve done both pro and constitution, and we\u2019ll be just fine. Speaker 48: (01:39:24) At the [crosstalk 01:39:25] earlier where you said that you\u2019re putting together the economic task force and that you thought that the recommendations were happening earlier than expected, did you mean to suggest that it could be before May 1st that you start recommending? Donald Trump: (01:39:36) I don\u2019t want to say that, but we\u2019re going to be putting our guidelines and recommendations fairly quickly in a few days. Speaker 48: (01:39:43) You\u2019re not rolling out that it would be before? Donald Trump: (01:39:44) I\u2019m not going to say it, but look. Certain states are doing very well. Certain big parts of the country are doing very well. They\u2019re doing really very well, so we\u2019re going to be putting out recommendations and guidelines very soon. Stay with us. Steve: (01:39:55) What would your guidelines be? Would they fit each area, or would they be a uniform set of guidelines? Donald Trump: (01:40:00) See, I don\u2019t want to tell you now, but right now we have a very strong indication that we know pretty much we have some good ideas. I also want to have \u2026 We\u2019ll have video conference or at least a conference call with a lot of very good people having to do with certain fields, whether it\u2019s energy or whether it\u2019s entertainment and restaurants, et cetera, et cetera. We have to get people back into restaurants. We have to do what we have to do, whether it\u2019s deductability or not. We\u2019ll see, but it should be deductability. You\u2019ll get them back so fast. I mean, they used to have deductability. The restaurant business, it was one of the hot businesses, and then they ended it a long time ago, many years ago, but we may need that to get people back into the restaurants. Speaker 49: (01:40:43) Yep. Michelle Obama today got behind mail-in voting nationwide as a possible solution to what\u2019s been going on in the states. She said it shouldn\u2019",

                              "text": "For people sick with the coronavirus, he said Sunday, \u201cIt can help them but it\u2019s not going to hurt them.\u201d In fact, it may or may not help some people, and it may or may not hurt them. His straight-ahead advocacy of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, is the latest and one of the most consequential examples of Trump and public-health authorities not being on the same page in the pandemic. His statement came during a weekend when he also misrepresented the facts behind his firing of the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general whose handling of a whistleblower complaint led to impeachment proceedings. Over the previous days, he\u2019d spread a number of distortions on the pandemic. A look at his recent remarks: MALARIA DRUG TRUMP, on the government\u2019s decision to stockpile millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine drug to make it available for patients with COVID-19: \u201cWhat do you have to lose? I\u2019ll say it again: What do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it. But it\u2019s their choice and it\u2019s their doctor\u2019s choice, or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine \u2014 try it, if you\u2019d like.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Saturday. TRUMP: \u201cThey say taking it before the fact is good. ... I\u2019m not acting as a doctor. I\u2019m saying do what you want. ... It can help them but it\u2019s not going to hurt them.\u201d \u2014 briefing Sunday night. THE FACTS: He\u2019s making unverified claims about a drug that can have serious side effects and may not work. The drug has not been approved as a treatment for COVID-19 and Trump\u2019s own health experts say more studies are needed to know whether it\u2019s safe and effective to use. The president has been talking up hydroxychloroquine, a drug long used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, after very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner. Doctors can already prescribe the malaria drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing. Research studies are now beginning to test if the drugs truly help COVID-19 patients, and the Food and Drug Administration has allowed the drugs into the national stockpile as an option for doctors to consider for patients who cannot get into one of the studies. But the drug has major potential side effects, especially for the heart, and large studies are underway to see if it is safe and effective for treating coronavirus. The FDA says people should not take it without a prescription and emphasizes that the malaria drugs being explored \u201care not FDA-approved for treatment of COVID-19.\u201d On Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said Americans shouldn\u2019t consider hydroxychloroquine a \u201cknockout drug.\u201d \u201cWe still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention, not just this one, is truly safe and effective,\u201d he said on Fox News. The American Medical Association, the American Pharmacists Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists in a joint statement previously cautioned against \u201cprophylactically prescribing medications currently identified as potential treatments for COVID-19.\u201d That means prescribing a medicine for the purpose of warding off a disease or preventing its spread. ___ SPANISH FLU TRUMP: \u201cThe problem is when something like this comes along, which you don\u2019t expect. Look, 1917, it\u2019s a long time ago, perhaps 100 million people died. It\u2019s a long time ago, so people don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \u2014 briefing Sunday night. THE FACTS: He got the year wrong for the Spanish flu and appeared to overstate deaths from it. The pandemic spread from early 1918 to late 1920. It killed an estimated 50 million or more worldwide, with about 675,000 of the deaths in the U.S., says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ___ IMPEACHMENT TRUMP, on firing Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general: \u201cI thought he did a terrible job. Absolutely terrible. He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report \u2014 it was fake. It was totally wrong.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Saturday. THE FACTS: No, the whistleblower\u2019s accusations have not been shown to be wrong. Key details have been corroborated. For example, the White House account of Trump\u2019s July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine\u2019s new president showed that the whistleblower had accurately summarized the conversation, as relayed by unidentified U.S. officials, in the complaint Atkinson sent to the acting director of national intelligence. Witnesses who heard the call testified to the accuracy of that account. ___ TRUMP, suggesting that Atkinson had claimed that the whistleblower complaint regarding Ukraine should be discounted because of political bias: \u201cHe even said it was politically biased. He actually said that.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Saturday. THE FACTS: He actually did not say that. Atkinson did not state that the complaint was \u201cpolitically biased\u201d or suggest that it should not be regarded seriously. To the contrary, Atkinson wrote in a letter to Joseph Maguire, then the acting director of national intelligence, that any potential bias on the whistleblower\u2019s part did not take away from his overall conclusion that the complaint was \u201ccredible.\u201d He noted that an initial review by his inspector general\u2019s office had found support for key allegations in the complaint, including that Trump had put pressure on Ukraine\u2019s leader to take action favorable to his re-election campaign. ___ THE VIRUS THREAT TRUMP, on a warning that had just been delivered by Dr. Deborah Birx of the coronavirus task force that more Americans need to heed distancing steps ordered by many states and recommended by Washington: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t referring to our country, she was referring to one state.\u201d \u2014 briefing Thursday. THE FACTS: No, she was talking about more Americans overall needing to keep away from each other. More specifically, Birx said the outbreak would not be spreading by now in areas with low infection rates if everyone were following the guidelines. Instead, officials are now seeing cases of people who were infected after the guidelines took effect. \u201cThis should not be happening any longer in new places if people are doing the social distancing, washing their hands, not getting together in large groups more than 10,\u201d she said at the briefing where Trump then tried to tamp down her warning out of his concern about the \u201cheadlines tomorrow.\u201d Birx said: \u201cWe see Spain, we see Italy, we see France, we see Germany. When we see others beginning to bend their curves, we can bend ours. But it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as Americans.\u201d Bending the curve means flattening out the rate of increase in cases. She added: \u201cYes. There are states that are dead flat. But, you know, every \u2014 what changes the curve is a new Detroit, a new Chicago, a new New Orleans, a new Colorado.\u201d ___ TRUMP: \u201cFour weeks ago, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest in the world \u2014 greatest in the history of the world.\u201d \u2014 briefing Thursday. THE FACTS: Not true. The economy was healthy back then but not the best in U.S. history, much less world history. Economic gains largely followed along the lines of an expansion that started more than a decade ago under President Barack Obama. And while posting great job and stock market numbers, Trump never managed to achieve the rates of economic growth he promised in the 2016 campaign. The U.S. economy was not the world\u2019s best in history when this started. ___ TRUMP, going back to that period four weeks ago: \u201cAnd then, one day, I get a call from Deborah, who\u2019s fantastic, and from Dr. Fauci. And he said and she said, \u2019We have a problem. I said, \u2019What\u2019s the problem?\u2019 And they said, \u2018We may have to close it up.\u2019 I said, \u2018Close what up?\u2019 They said, \u2018Close up the country.\u2019 And I said, \u2018What\u2019s that all about?\u2019\u201d \u2014 briefing Thursday. THE FACTS: You\u2019d think that Trump was just learning about the outbreak from Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health in the phone call. That\u2019s not the case. Trump knew the U.S. had \u201ca problem\u201d well before that timeline of roughly early March. By then the U.S. had restricted travel from abroad, experienced its first coronavirus infections and was told to expect the outbreak to spread in the country. The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency Jan. 30. ___ VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the president has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus.\u201d \u2014 CNN interview Wednesday. MITCH McCONNELL, Senate majority leader: The coronavirus crisis \u201ccame up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial. And I think it diverted the attention of the government, because everything, every day was all about impeachment.\u201d \u2014 interview Tuesday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. THE FACTS: While Pence claims Trump always treated the virus threat seriously, McConnell suggests Trump may not have because he was distracted by impeachment. Neither claim is credible. Trump says he would not have done anything faster on the virus, absent impeachment. And he actually belittled the coronavirus threat repeatedly from January to mid-March, maintaining his position even after the Senate acquitted him Feb. 5 in his impeachment trial. He dismissed the threat as a small number of U.S. cases that were under \u201ccontrol\u201d and would fall to zero by April. On Feb. 10, he asserted \u201cwe\u2019re in great shape ... we have 12 cases\u201d and told Fox Business it will be fine because \u201cin April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather. And that\u2019s a beautiful date to look forward to.\u201d  \u201cWhen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said Feb. 26. A day later he said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day \u2014 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2014 it will disappear,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s got the world aflutter, but it\u2019ll work out,\u201d Trump told the National Association of Counties on March 3. Along the way, he said Democrats who were calling on him to do more were perpetuating a hoax. On March 9, he tweeted the 546 cases and 22 deaths experienced by then in the U.S. were no reason to take drastic steps: \u201cNothing is shut down, life & the economy go on.\u201d Trump now acknowledges the U.S. could see 100,000 to 240,000 deaths from the pandemic even if current distancing guidelines are maintained. When asked Tuesday if impeachment proceedings had distracted him from the U.S. coronavirus response, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have acted any differently or I don\u2019t think I would have acted any faster.\u201d ___ SOCIAL MEDIA TRUMP: \u201cI have, you know, hundreds of millions of people. Number one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I mean, I just found out I\u2019m number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice for whatever it means.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Wednesday. THE FACTS: It doesn\u2019t mean anything because it\u2019s not true. He\u2019s nowhere close to No. 1. Trump has 29 million followers on Facebook, far below former President Barack Obama, who has 54 million. Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese soccer player, has 126 million. ___ TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS TRUMP: \u201cI stopped some very, very infected, very, very sick people, thousands coming in from China long earlier than anybody thought, including the experts. Nobody thought we should do it except me. And I stopped everybody. We stopped it cold.\u201d \u2014 interview March 30 with \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d PENCE: \u201cThe president suspended all travel from China in January.\u201d \u2014 interview Wednesday with CNN. THE FACTS: Trump didn\u2019t \u201cstop cold\u201d all the people infected with coronavirus from entering the U.S. with a ban of all travel from China. There were gaps in containment and initial delays in testing, leading to the U.S. rising to No. 1 globally in the number of people infected by COVID-19. Nor did Trump decide on his own to impose travel restrictions on China \u2014 he followed a consensus recommendation by his public-health advisers. His order in late January temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in China within the previous 14 days, with exceptions for the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Americans returning from China were allowed back for two more weeks. They were given enhanced screenings. But screenings can miss people who are carrying the virus but showing no symptoms. ___ MORTALITY TRUMP: \u201cSo we have more cases than anybody, but we\u2019re doing really well, and we also have a very low \u2014 relative to other countries \u2014 very low mortality rate. And there are reasons for that.\u201d \u2014 interview March 30 with \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d TRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing more test \u2014 tests than any other country anywhere in the world. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we\u2019ve been testing. It\u2019s also one of the reasons that we\u2019re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate.\u201d \u2014 news briefing on March 29. THE FACTS: His suggestion that the U.S. response is better than other countries\u2019 because its mortality rate is \u201cjust about the lowest\u201d is unsupported and misleading. It\u2019s too early to know the real death rate from COVID-19 in any country. Look at a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, and you can divide the number of reported cases by the number of recorded deaths. But that math provides a completely unreliable measurement of death rates, and the Johns Hopkins tally is not intended to be that. First, the count changes every day as new infections and deaths are recorded. More important, every country is testing differently. Knowing the real denominator, the true number of people who become infected, is key to determining what portion of them die. Some countries, the U.S. among them, have had trouble making enough tests available. When there\u2019s a shortage of tests, the sickest get tested first. And even with a good supply of tests, someone who\u2019s otherwise healthy and has mild symptoms may not be tested and thus go uncounted. The result is a hodgepodge of numbers that get sorted out as the crisis diminishes. Indeed, initial death rates were thought to be as high as 4% in parts of China. But a report published Monday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases calculated that 1.38% actually is the best estimate of deaths among confirmed cases across China and that accounting for unconfirmed cases could drop that rate below 1%. Early on Fauci estimated that the death rate in the U.S. might hit around 1%, which would be 10 times higher than mortality from a typical flu season. ___ Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Lauran Neergaard and Matthew Perrone in Washington, Alan Suderman in Richmond, Va., and Amanda Seitz in Chicago contributed to this report. ___ EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___  Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd  Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck___",

At that time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one. Please be advised today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Benjamin Haynes. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you. And thank you all for joining us for today\u2019s update on CDC\u2019s COVID-19 response. We are joined by the director of CDC\u2019s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases who will give opening remarks. I will now turn the call over. Thank you for joining us. The global novel coronavirus situation is rapidly evolving and expanding. There are still a lot of news coverage about community spread in a few countries since the last time we talked. This means that cases of COVID-19 are appearing without a known source of exposure. Communities include Hong Kong, Italy, Iran, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Community spread is often a trigger to begin implementing new strategies tailored to local circumstances that blunt the impact of disease and can slow the spread of virus. The fact this virus has caused illness \u2013 including illness resulting in death, and sustained person-to-person spread is concerning. These factors meet two of the criteria of the pandemic. The world moves closer towards meeting the third criteria. Worldwide spread of the new virus. The U.S. has been implementing an aggressive containment strategy that requires detecting, tracking, and isolating all cases. As much as possible and preventing more introduction of disease notably at points of entry. We\u2019ve restricted travel into the United States while also issuing extensive travel advisories for countries currently experiencing community spread. Our travel notices are changing almost daily. We\u2019ve also enacted the first quarantine of this scale in the U.S. And are supporting the state department and HHS in repatriating citizens from high-risk areas. We are doing this with the goal of slowing the introduction of this new virus into the U.S. And buying us more time to prepare. To date, our containment strategies have been largely successful. As a result, we have very few cases in the United States and no spread in the community. But as more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder. Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country. It\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness. We will maintain for as long as practical a dual approach where we continue measures to contain this disease but also employ strategies to minimize the impact on our communities. At this time, there\u2019s no vaccine to protect against this new virus and no medications approved to treat it. Non-pharmaceutical interventions or NPIs will be the most important tools in our response to this virus. What these interventions look like at the community level will vary depending on local conditions. What is appropriate for one community seeing local transmission won\u2019t necessarily be appropriate for a community where no local transmission has occurred. This parallel, proactive approach of containment and mitigation will delay the emergence of community spread in the United States while simultaneously reducing its ultimate impact. To illustrate how this works, I\u2019d like to share with you some of the specific recommendations made in the document I mentioned last Friday including some of the steps we would take here if needed. This document is called Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza United States 2017. It draws from the findings of nearly 200 journal articles written between 1990 and 2016. This document looked at what can be done at the individual and community level during a pandemic when we don\u2019t have a vaccine or proven medical treatment for the disease. We\u2019re looking at data since 2016 and adjusting our recommendations to the specific circumstances of COVID-19. But this posted document provides a frame work for our response strategy. Based on what is known now, we would implement these NPI measures in a very aggressive, proactive way as he have been doing with our containment efforts. There are three categories of NPIs. Personal NPIs which include personal protective measures you can take every day and personal protective measures reserved for pandemics. Community NPIs which include social distancing measures designed to keep people who are sick away from others. And school closures and dismissals. And environmental NPIs which includes surface cleaning measures. NPIs routinely recommended for prevention of respiratory virus transmission include everyday personal protective measures. These are preventive measures we recommend during influenza season. These NPIs are recommended during a pandemic regardless of the severity level of the respiratory illness. Personal protective measures reserved for pandemics include voluntary home quarantine of household members who have been exposed to someone they live with who is sick. Now I\u2019d like to talk through some examples of what community NPIs look like. These are practical measures that can help limit exposure by reducing exposure in community settings. Students in smaller groups or in a severe pandemic, closing schools and using internet-based teleschooling to continue education. For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase teleworking options. On a larger scale, communities may need to modify, postpone, or cancel mass gatherings. Looking at how to increase telehealth services and delaying elective surgery. The implementation of environmental NPIs would require everyone to consistently clean frequently touched surfaces and objects at home, at school, at work, and at large gatherings. Local communities will need to look at which NPIs to implement and when based on how transmission and disease is and what can be done locally. This will require flexibility and adaptations as disease progresses and new information becomes available. Some of these measures are better than none. But the maximum benefit occurs when the elements are layered upon each other. Some community level interventions that may be most effective in reducing the spread of a new virus like school closures are also the most likely to be associated with unwanted consequences and further disruptions. Secondary consequences of some of these measures might include missed work and loss of income. I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now. I had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning and I told my children that while I didn\u2019t think that they were at risk right now, we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives. You should ask your children\u2019s school about their plans for school dismissals or school closures. If ask if there are plans for teleschool. I contacted my local school superintendent this morning with exactly those questions. You should think about what you would do for childcare if schools or day cares close. If teleworking is an option for you. All of these questions can help you be better prepared for what might happen. CDC and other federal agencies have been practicing for this since the 2019 influenza pandemic. In the last two years, CDC has engaged in two pandemic influenza exercises that have required us to prepare for a severe pandemic and just this past year we had a whole of government exercise practicing similarly around a pandemic of influenza. Right now CDC is operationalizing all of its pandemic response plans working on multiple fronts including specific measures to prepare communities to respond to local transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. Before I take questions, I want to address the issue of the test kits CDC is developing. I am frustrated like I know many of you are that we have had issues with our test. I want to assure you that we are working to modify the kit and hope to send out a new version to state and local jurisdictions soon. There are currently 12 states or localities around the U.S. That can test samples as well as we are testing at CDC 400 samples were tested overnight. There is no current backlog or delay for testing at CDC. Commercial labs will also be coming online soon with their own tests. This will allow the greatest number of tests to happen closer to where potential cases are. Last, I want to recognize that people are concerned about this situation. I would say rightfully so. I\u2019m concerned about the situation. CDC is concerned about the situation. But we are putting our concerns to work preparing. And now is the time for businesses, hospitals, community schools, and everyday people to begin preparing as well. Over the last few weeks, CDC has been on dozens of calls with different partners in the health, retail, education, and business sectors. In the hopes that employers begin to respond in a flexible way to differing levels of severity, to refine their business response plans as needed. I also want to acknowledge the importance of uncertainty. During an outbreak with a new virus, there is a lot of uncertainty. Our guidance and advice are likely to be fluid subject to change as we learn more. We will continue to keep you updated. I\u2019d be happy to take a few questions now. Brittany, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin our question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question over the phone, press star, then one and record your name clearly when prompted. If you need to withdraw your question, press star then two. One moment as we wait for the first question. Our first question comes from Lisa from PBS. Your line is now open. Good morning. Thank you for doing this. I have some more questions about the test kits. Thank you for what you gave us the update on, but can you go into more detail about how they work? Can any hospital now just kind of use a swab to get a sample and then send that to the CDC? And then how long do you estimate it will take to have the kits replaced so that more localities can actually do the analysis and do you have enough money for this kind of field work and test analysis right now? Okay. I\u2019m going to start from maybe the part of a patient perspective which is, you know, right now our focus is still on individuals with a travel history that would put them at risk for COVID-19. Or people who are close contacts of someone who has COVID-19. Those individuals when they are identified by a health care provider, the health care provider calls the health department. The health department helps them triage those patients to make \u2014 and then the samples are worked with the health department. Now, as we move forward, though, if we are looking at the trajectory of expecting that there likely will be community spread of this virus in the united states, the case definition may change away from narrowly around people with travel. Again, that\u2019s what we would anticipate doing as there is community spread. If that happens, it will be more and more important that the clinicians have a full tool kit. That\u2019s why the availability of commercial kits would be so helpful. So in the short-term, it\u2019s the clinician calls the health department. And either the health department already has the test kit themselves or if they don\u2019t yet have it stood up, they send it to CDC. Our turnaround at CDC is within a day. There is a little bit of shipping time. But that\u2019s the process. In terms of timing, I think at this point what I would say is we are working as fast as we can. We understand the frustration of our partners in the health care sector, in health departments. You certainly can imagine we want to resolve this as quickly as possible. But we have to make sure that while resolving it, we keep to the highest level of quality assurance. Because as important as speed is, it is more important that we make sure that our results are correct. In terms of funding, there\u2019s already been funds available that are helping us with the activities that we have now that is the diagnostic testing at CDC. And we\u2019ll continue to proceed focused on our priorities which as I\u2019ve said are getting this test kit out to state health departments so they can be doing that themselves as an interim step to getting it commercially available would be a great advancement. Next question. Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig from KNX 1070 news radio Los Angeles. Your line is now open. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your time. Couple of questions. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about what\u2019s being done to prepare for possible people who would be quarantined. I\u2019d like to know what that is. And also is the Chinese government leveling with you? Are they telling you the truth? Have they given you the straight dope, so to speak, as to what you need to know about the coronavirus? So in answer to your first question, I would say generally we are working on a daily basis with state and local health departments across the country on exactly those issues. What are the local considerations for quarantine or isolation and how can they be resolved? And in each location in the united states, it may end up being a slightly different answer. Our focus is on the best health of the individual whom we are working with in terms of whether they need quarantine or isolation. In terms of the Chinese government, there has been a WHO team on the ground in China as well in Wuhan. There are data coming out from those efforts. We have a lot of information from china. Frankly, we have a lot of new information from all the other countries around the world now that are reporting community spread and we are as quickly as possible trying to synthesize that information. It is providing us more data in terms of making our own estimations in the U.S. Of what we\u2019re going to see. Communities that are having community spread are certainly very informative in terms of what we might expect in the united states. And I think that whole body of evidence is frankly coming really quickly at us. That\u2019s why we have a team of people here at CDC synthesizing it all. Next question, please. Thank you. And our next question comes from Megan from STAT. Your line is now open. Hi there. Thank you so much for taking my question. I\u2019m wondering if you could expand a little bit on whether you are reconsidering testing people with travel history to other countries now where they might be infected. And I\u2019m also wondering if you could say whether or not the agency has considered getting tests from another country that\u2019s supplying tests to other nations as well. So the answer to the first question is certainly, we\u2019re considering what the spread of illness in other countries looks like and how it impacts the potential risk the Americans traveling abroad in those countries. Those conversations are going on as we speak. We obviously are working closely with the partners on those considerations. And when there is new information in terms of case definitions, we\u2019ll definitely publicize that broadly. You know, as I said, we are still at the stage of containment, but we are already starting to plan for mitigation. And part of the mitigation planning is the participation of community spread in the united states. And as that happens, it would certainly dramatically impact how we\u2019re considering who is on the case. As you can imagine, the symptoms of novel coronavirus look a lot like other viral respiratory diseases that are circulating this time of year. So it\u2019s going to be difficult for clinicians to differentiate fully on the basis of those \u2014 solely on the basis of the symptoms. In terms of diagnostic tests, what I would say is we\u2019re working closely with FDA on this. And obviously with the state and local health department partners. And I think that we are rapidly moving towards getting those kits more available in the U.S. In the systems that we have. Really I think we\u2019re close. I just wouldn\u2019t want to give an estimate of when until we\u2019re there. But I think we\u2019re close. And remember, a dozen states now have the kit and are testing and there\u2019s tests available in the U.S. So I think we\u2019re making forward progress. Thank you. And our next question comes from Lena Sun from Washington Post. Your line is now open. Thank you. I had a couple questions. One is if a dozen states have the kit, then do they still need to send those tests to CDC for confirmation? Which are the states that have the tests? And more broadly, your comments today seem to represent a significant escalation in the sort of severity and urgency of the now. At a briefing this morning for Congress, I believe some members were told that we now face a very strong chance of an extremely serious outbreak. Is that the CDC\u2019s feeling right now that we face an extremely strong chance of a serious outbreak? Okay. So let\u2019s see. The first question, it\u2019s 12 state or local health departments. And so it\u2019s not 12 states total. We are still as a point of part of how we roll out these tests, those tests that are positive still do come to CDC for confirmation. I think that\u2019s just part of a normal process to ensure we are keeping to the utmost quality control. I don\u2019t have a list of state or local health departments in front of me, but I think we can provide that. In terms of a change in tone, I guess what I would say is as I look back on the scripts of the telebriefings that we\u2019ve given over the past month, we have for a long time been saying \u2014 we have for many weeks been saying that while we hope this is not going to be severe, we are planning as if it is. The data over the last week and the spread in other countries has certainly raised our level of concern and raised our level of expectation that we are going to have community spread here. So I think that that\u2019s perhaps the change of tone you\u2019ve seen. I think what we still don\u2019t know is what that will look like as many of you know. We can have community spread in the united states and have it be reasonably mild. We could have community spread in the united states and have it be very severe. And so that is what \u2014 that is what we don\u2019t completely know yet. And we certainly also don\u2019t exactly know when it\u2019s going to happen. I think it would be nice for everybody if we could say, you know, on this date is when it\u2019s going to start. We don\u2019t know that yet. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re asking folks in every sector as well as people within their families to start planning for this because as we\u2019ve seen from the recent countries that have had community spread when it is hit in those countries, it has moved quite rapidly. So we want to make sure that the American public is prepared. Thank you. And as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one. Limit to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from Eben from Fox news. Your line is now open. Thank you very much for doing the call today. There has been some political back and forth now that democrats are accusing the president which essentially means the administration and everything that falls under that as being ill prepared for coronavirus, requesting too little of amount in terms of their request for $2.5 billion. Do you feel that we are ill prepared from a financial standpoint? I know you are a clinician and I don\u2019t want you to get too much into politics, but do you have what you need to do your job? I guess I\u2019ll answer that two ways. The first is HHS can provide information or answer questions about the funds that are available. What I can say from my perspective is I\u2019ve been at CDC for 25 years and that if you asked public health officials over the course of that time what they feared as an expectation, it was something exactly like this. And so the idea that we might have a pandemic of influenza or a pandemic of a respiratory viral infection is something that we\u2019ve known about and have been planning and preparing for. That\u2019s why we at CDC have been exercising with the state and local health departments. That\u2019s why the whole of government exercise last year, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested so much on the foundation we are now responding. But that being said, we are never going to ever be able to be so completely prepared that we\u2019re prepared for any inevitability. We always are going to find that diseases surprise us and that there was some consideration that is slightly different from what we planned for. So have we made a lot of progress in the 25 years I\u2019ve been here? Yes. Are we better prepared today than we were 20 years ago? Yes. But are we completely prepared? You know, diseases surprise us and therefore we need to be reacting to the current situation even if it differs from what we planned for. You know, in general we are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad. I continue to hope that in the end we\u2019ll look back and feel like we are over-prepared, but that is a better place to be in than being under-prepared. And just like the preparedness for a pandemic influenza provides such a strong foundation for this response, any preparedness we do as a country, at schools, businesses, within our families will always be helpful for whatever the next event is. And so I don\u2019t think in general that preparedness will ever go to waste. Next question, please. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike from A.P. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you for taking my call. If I could ask a couple. One is just the latest case count, it\u2019s been a little confusing for some of us just to sort out exactly how many U.S. Cases there are and how they\u2019re being sorted out. Second, if you could speak to your best and latest understanding of the severity of the disease. Of course there\u2019s some news today about the WHO mission coming back and statements about not finding a lot of undetected cases. I was wondering if that\u2019s related to CDC gearing up for these NPIs. And lastly, talking about the exercising you\u2019ve been doing, what was the weakness or weaknesses that kept coming up in the exercises that you\u2019re most concerned about and you\u2019re really trying to stay on top of now that we have a real time experience happening? Thank you. Okay. So let me \u2014 so let me start by saying that I know the case counts can be confusing. I will try to sort out what the numbers are as of today and try to explain why it perhaps is a little confusing. There remain 14 confirmed U.S. Cases. We are separating out the cases among repatriated individuals. So those are 14 U.S. Cases. 12 of those are travelers who returned from an area where disease is circulating. Two of those are close contacts of another case. That\u2019s 14. There are three novel coronavirus patients among people who are repatriated from Hubei that is in the repatriated flights. And our website says 36 because we updated this yesterday, but in fact as of this morning, there are 40 positives among individuals repatriated from the \u201cDiamond Princess.\u201d so these are Americans who were on board the \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d repatriated back to the United States. And that\u2019s 40. So that means just to go back that there are 14 confirmed cases picked up through the U.S. public health systems. And 40 plus 3 makes 43 among individuals repatriated into the United States. I do hope that helps. In terms of the severity, I think that there are a variety of reports that give information about severity. We\u2019ve looked at severity among people, among reported people from Hubei. We\u2019ve looked at reported people from elsewhere in china. And certainly the data coming out from Korea and Iran and Italy suggests also deaths which are concerning. In terms of our messaging today, I really would say that it is more driven by the community spread in other countries than it is specifically from data from china. And so I think it really is the spreading of COVID-19 through other countries that makes all of us feel that the risk of spread in the united states has \u2014 is increasing. In terms of exercising, you know, there are always small and big things that we learn from exercising. Maybe two specific things I\u2019ll point out is that our exercising did show us that if we had a pandemic, there were going to be supply issues. And I think that we are now across the whole of government thinking through and working on those supply issues. One of them is enough protection for health care workers. This is clearly a priority. The health care workers put themselves on the front line caring for ill patients and has to be a priority to make sure they are protected. Another issue is the NPIs. The non-pharmaceutical interventions. We have worked across governmental sectors to get input into our planning guidance. But it\u2019s one thing to plan for those NPIs. It\u2019s certainly another thing to be able to implement them at a large scale. And I think one of the reasons that we\u2019re talking about this so proactively today is that we recognize that implementing NPIs at this level that we want to prepare the american people that their lives could be interrupted. Next. Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric of ABC news. Your line is open. Thanks, Benjamin. Thanks, Nancy for taking our questions. I\u2019m wondering like the chicken and the egg with the case definition and the testing. If you\u2019re telling us today it\u2019s not a question of if but when there\u2019ll be community spread and it\u2019s very difficult to \u2014 for clinicians to know the difference between flu and COVID-19, how come you\u2019re not widening the case definition to test more people? So let me answer that two ways. One is that we have more than one layer of surveillance. I think I talked about this in a previous call, but maybe just to talk about it a little more. There is a specific patient-under-investigation case definition that really does focus on travel because that is where the cases that are picked up through our public health systems are. But we are also aware and concerned about the possibility for broader spread in the U.S. That\u2019s why the Secretary and we announced last week that we were going to be doing more community-based surveillance relying on the infrastructure of our influenza. So we have already started that surveillance system. We\u2019re rapidly working within the next couple weeks to expand that more broadly. As well, we have a variety of other more community-oriented surveillance systems that we\u2019re working to stand up to be able to look for those cases in the community. So this is proceeding in stages with the one surveillance but community surveillance also rapidly starting. Brittany, we have time for two more questions, please. Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren from San Antonio Express News. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking my call. I wanted to ask about the 14-day incubation period that has been reiterated by many public health officials including the quarantine of the evacuees. We\u2019ve seen some isolated reports coming from other countries suggesting that it is possible that the incubation period has been longer in some individuals in other countries who have been quarantined for more than 14 days. And I was wondering if you guys have any reason to suspect whether the incubation period may be longer than 14 days for those of Wuhan that have been released from their quarantine. Thank you. That\u2019s actually a really important question. And something we\u2019re looking at closely. Some of the reports that you\u2019ve seen are reports in the media, not reports in peer reviewed literature. And it impacts our ability to fully scientifically evaluate them. As I\u2019ve said in previous meetings, there are a team of \u2014 there are more than 50 modeling mathematical modeling groups in the United States all working with us to look at a variety of issues around this response to novel coronavirus. One of the things they\u2019re certainly analyzing is all of the available data on the incubation period. And the data so far still supports using 14 days as the top window. In terms of isolated reports elsewhere, there are a variety of possibilities. One possibility is \u2014 there\u2019s a variety of possibilities \u2013 what we\u2019ll do is continue to synthesize and evaluate the available data trying to make a data-driven decision. And if more data becomes available that suggests a longer incubation period, we will certainly be visible and public about that. I think at this point, we\u2019re still comfortable that 14 days is the appropriate top line for that. Last question, please. Thank you. And our final question comes from Ben from CNN. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. This morning while he was traveling in India, President Trump said that he thinks that the coronavirus is a problem that is going to go away. He seems very optimistic about this and we\u2019re trying to figure out exactly why he believes so strongly that to be the case. And so my question for you is what information is your agency specifically giving the president and the White House about the current state of the coronavirus outbreak? As you imagine, we brief the Secretary daily and the Secretary is the lead of the White House task force. And Ddr. Redfield the CDC director is briefing them daily. In terms of the course of this illness, we have a \u2014 again, a team of mathematical modelers working with us to try to predict the trajectory. One hypothesis is that we could be hopeful that this could potentially be seasonal. Other viral respiratory diseases are seasonal including influenza and therefore in many viral respiratory diseases, we do see a decrease in disease in spring and summer. And so we could certainly be optimistic that this disease will follow suit. But we\u2019re not going to know that until time keeps ticking forward. We\u2019re going to be, again, preparing as if this is going to continue, preparing as if we\u2019re going to see community spread in the near term. But I\u2019m always going to be hopeful that that disease will decline either for the summer or that, you know, we\u2019ll be over-prepared and we won\u2019t see the high levels of transmission here in the U.S. Thank you, doctor. And thank you, all, for joining us for today\u2019s briefing. Please visit CDC\u2019s 2019 novel coronavirus website for continued updates. And if you have further questions, please call the main media line at 404-639-3286 or email media@CDC.gov. Thank you. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

About 1.6 million people have recovered. Nearly three million laid-off workers in the US have applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total since coronavirus shutdowns began two months ago to over 36 million. Officials have confirmed the first coronavirus infection of a Rohingya refugee in the sprawling camps in southern Bangladesh, where over 1 million members of the persecuted Muslim ethnic group live. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has surpassed 250,000, but daily new infections fell below 10,000 for the first time in nearly two weeks. US authorities have accused China-linked hackers of breaking into organisations in the US researching the coronavirus. The United Nations is forecasting that the pandemic will push an estimated 34.3 million people into extreme poverty, mostly in Africa.

It specifically singles out a member of China's powerful Politburo as responsible for \"gross human rights violations\" against them. 21:35 GMT - New York Stock Exchange to reopen The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) trading floor will partially reopen on May 26, over two months after it closed down to control the spread of the coronavirus, NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal.

Remdesivir is the only drug approved to treat COVID-19 after promising early trial results prompted United States regulators to grant emergency use authorisation on May 2. To expand its access, Gilead said this week that it had signed nonexclusive licensing pacts with five generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan, allowing them to make and sell remdesivir for 127 countries. But health access groups say the pacts mean cheaper forms of the drug may not become available in nations seen as nonprofitable to the five drugmakers. Read more here.

The UN's mid-year report said COVID-19 is expected to slash global economic output by nearly $8.5 trillion over the next two years, wiping out nearly all gains of the past four years. In January, the UN forecast modest growth of 2.5 percent in 2020. 04:18 GMT - UN's Guterres: Address mental health needs amid pandemic UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged governments, civil society and health authorities to urgently address mental health needs arising from the pandemic, warning that psychological suffering is increasing. In a video address late on Wednesday, Guterres pointed to \"grief at the loss of loved ones, shock at the loss of jobs, isolation and restrictions on movement, difficult family dynamics, and uncertainty and fear for the future.\" \"After decades of neglect and under-investment in mental health services, the COVID-19 pandemic is now hitting families and communities with additional mental stress.\" 04:02 GMT - Australia reports surge in coronavirus-fuelled unemployment Australia posted its biggest ever monthly rise in unemployment on Thursday because of coronavirus lockdown measures, even as the country begins to gradually ease physical distancing rules. Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed employment in April dropped by 594,300, the largest fall on record, fuelling the 6.2 percent unemployment. 03:49 GMT - Japan to end state of emergency for most regions; Tokyo to stay on alert Japan was expected to lift a state of emergency across a large part of the country on Thursday, according to Reuters news agency, but the capital Tokyo will remain under restrictions until there is convincing evidence the coronavirus had been contained. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to hold a news conference later on Thursday, and is expected to announce the lifting of the state of emergency for 39 of Japan's 47 prefectures, not including Tokyo. The world's third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80 percent in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services. The government had said it would reassess the situation in mid-May. The Japanese government declared a state of emergency last month, said it would reassess the situation in mid-May [Koji Sasahara/AP] 03:12 GMT - South Korea raises alarms over infections at nightspots Infections in Seoul coming from nightspots in the neighbourhood of Itaewon reached 72 on Thursday, according to the Yonhap news agency, raising fears over what South Korean health authorities described as \"a truly cruel virus\" further spreading in the capital. The cases traced to Itaewon form the second-largest cluster of infections in Seoul, following 98 cases linked to a call centre in the southwestern area of Sindorim. Daily new infections in the country came in at 29, including 22 in the Seoul area, bringing the country's total infections to 10,991 on Thursday, Yonhap quoted health officials as saying. The death toll is at 260. 02:48 GMT - US: Wisconsin court tosses out governor's stay-home order The supreme court of the US state of Wisconsin has struck down Governor Tony Evers' coronavirus stay-at-home order, ruling that his administration overstepped its authority when it extended it for another month without consulting legislators. The 4-3 ruling essentially reopens the state, lifting caps on the size of gatherings, allowing people to travel as they please, and allowing shuttered businesses to reopen, including bars and restaurants. The decision let stand language that had closed schools, however, and local governments can still impose their own health restrictions. 02:06 GMT - Japanese pharma company says coronavirus treatment trial to start in July The Japanese company, Takeda Pharmaceutical, could start a clinical trial as early as July for a potential treatment of COVID-19 that is based on antibodies from recovered patients' blood, company executives said. The clinical trial would include hundreds of patients and take several months to complete. If successful, Japan's Takeda could file for approval by US authorities this year, said Julie Kim, president of the plasma-derived therapies unit of Takeda. \"When the product will be available beyond the clinical study is still a bit unclear,\" Kim said on an investor call. \"We do expect that, before the end of the year, we should see some information in terms of broader use.\" More: 01:18 GMT - Whistle-blower: US could face 'darkest winter' if virus rebounds America faces the \"darkest winter in modern history\" unless leaders act decisively to prevent a rebound of the coronavirus, says a government whistle-blower who alleges he was removed from his job after warning the Trump administration to prepare for the pandemic, the Associated Press news agency reported. Immunologist Dr Rick Bright made his sobering prediction in a testimony prepared for his appearance on Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aspects of his complaint about the administration's early handling of the crisis are expected to be backed up by testimony from an executive of a company that manufactures respirator masks. \"If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities,\" Bright said in his prepared testimony posted on the House committee website. 01:02 GMT - Mexico's total deaths from coronavirus rise to 4,220 Mexico's health ministry confirmed 1,862 new cases of coronavirus infections on Wednesday, along with 294 additional deaths, slightly lower than the country's record number of daily fatalities reported the day before, Reuters news agency reported. The new infections brought confirmed coronavirus cases to 40,186 and 4,220 deaths in total, according to the official tally.

The two neighbouring countries had agreed on April 18 to extend border restrictions until May 21 as cases of the disease continued to rise in both nations. Canada is now pressing for the measures to remain for another month. 00:35 GMT - China reports 3 new cases from mainland, no new imported infections China's National Health Commission reported on Thursday at least three new cases of the coronavirus cases in the country as of the end of Wednesday - down from seven cases the previous day. The health agency also said none of the cases was imported. Of the 82,929 total cases officially reported in China, 78,195 have recovered and 101 remain active, while 4,633 have died. China reported no new imported cases as of the end of Wednesday [Ng Han Guan/AP] 00:01 GMT - Spokesman for Mexican foreign minister has coronavirus The chief spokesman for Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has tested positive for the coronavirus, and an official in the president's office has died of the disease, bringing the pandemic closer to the inner circle of government. The spokesman, Roberto Velasco Alvarez, is a close aide to Ebrard. Mexico has recorded more than 38,000 infections and close to 4,000 deaths due to the virus. __________________________________________________________ Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera's continuing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

France says US priority on Sanofi vaccine unacceptable Giving some countries such as the United States priority access to any coronavirus vaccine developed by Sanofi would be unacceptable, France's junior economy minister said on Thursday, after the firm suggested Americans could get it first. The French drugmaker's chief executive, Paul Hudson, said on Wednesday that vaccine doses produced in the United States could go to US patients first, given the country had supported the research financially. \"It would of course be unacceptable for us if there were to be a privileged access for this or that country under pretext of a pecuniary motive, especially in the current context,\" Agnes Pannier-Runacher, France's junior economy minister, told Sud Radio.",

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors. Since the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), there have been widespread claims on social media that certain foods and supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19. Even though the World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to dispel such myths surrounding \u201cmiracle\u201d foods and coronavirus, misinformation continues to circulate. Though we all want to protect ourselves against COVID-19, there is currently no evidence that eating certain foods or following certain diets will protect you against coronavirus. Here are some of the most common myths debunked: Myth 1: garlic There is some evidence showing that garlic has antibacterial effects, with existing studies indicating the active compounds of garlic (including allicin, allyl alcohol and diallyl disulfide) are protective against some types of bacteria like salmonella and staphylococcus aureus. However, research investigating garlic\u2019s antiviral properties is limited. Though garlic is considered to be a healthy food, there\u2019s no evidence showing that eating it can prevent or cure COVID-19. Myth 2: lemons One viral Facebook video claimed that drinking warm water with lemon slices could combat novel coronavirus. However, there\u2019s no scientific evidence that lemon can cure the disease. Lemon is a good source of vitamin C, which is important for helping immune cells work properly. However, many other citrus fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C. Myth 3: vitamin C As previously stated, Vitamin C is known to play a role in supporting the normal functioning of the immune system. Yet, it\u2019s not the only nutrient that maintains the the immune system. Most of the misinformation on vitamin C and coronavirus comes from studies that have investigated the links between vitamin C and the common cold. Despite claims online that vitamin C can prevent and treat the common cold, the evidence in support of this is not only limited, but conflicting too. There are also significant differences between the common cold and coronavirus. There\u2019s currently no strong evidence that supplementing with vitamin C will prevent or cure COVID-19. Most adults will also meet their vitamin C requirements from a diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables. Myth 4: alkaline foods Misinformation spread on social media suggests the virus can be cured by eating foods with a pH (level of acidity) that is higher than the virus\u2019s pH. A pH below 7.0 is considered acidic, a 7.0 pH is neutral, and above pH 7.0 is alkaline. Some of the \u201calkaline foods\u201d said to \u201ccure\u201d coronavirus were lemons, limes, oranges, turmeric tea and avocados. However, many of these online sources give incorrect pH values to these foods. For example, the pH of a lemon was said to be 9.9, when it\u2019s actually very acidic, with a pH of 2. There are claims that acidic foods can become alkaline after being metabolised by the body. Overall, there\u2019s no evidence indicating that foods can even affect the pH levels of blood, cells or tissues \u2013 let alone cure viral infections. The body regulates acidity levels, regardless of the types of food being consumed. Myth 5: keto diet The ketogenic (keto) diet, which is a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet, has been said to be protective against COVID-19. This comes from the idea that it can \u201cboost\u201d the immune system. Though one study showed that keto might prevent or treat the flu, this study used mice models. This makes it difficult to know if keto would have a similar effect on humans at preventing or treating the flu. There is also currently no existing scientific evidence demonstrating that a ketogenic diet can prevent coronavirus. Current advice The British Dietetic Association (BDA) has stated no specific food or supplements can prevent a person from catching COVID-19. Alongside WHO advice, the BDA encourages people to consume a healthy, balanced diet to support the immune system. A healthy and varied diet containing the five main food groups can help provide most people with the nutrients they need. Most of the nutrients we already get from our regular diet (including copper, folate, iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and D) are all involved in maintaining normal immune function. People are also encouraged to take protective measures against COVID-19, including washing hands frequently, maintaining social distancing, and following lockdown orders. However, the BDA does advise adults living in the UK to take a daily supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D and eat vitamin D rich foods, like oily fish, egg yolks, and fortified breakfast cereals to ensure adequate vitamin D levels. This is because our main source of vitamin D is sunlight \u2013 and because of lockdown measures, many of us aren\u2019t getting enough sunlight exposure. When it comes to online misinformation, it can sometimes be difficult to spot what is and isn\u2019t true. But in general, a claim is likely to be \u201cfake\u201d if it: Recommends eating a specific food, drink, or supplement (especially in high doses) to cure and prevent coronavirus Encourages restricting main food groups from your diet Singles out a certain food over others to protect or treat the virus Includes buzzwords \u2013 such as \u201ccleanse\u201d, \u201ccure\u201d, \u201ctreat\u201d, \u201cboost\u201d, \u201cdetox\u201d or \u201csuperfoods\u201d \u2013 when recommending a single food item or supplement It\u2019s not provided by a reliable and trusted health authority or organisation, like the NHS or WHO. Social media is a powerful and great tool. However, it can also be a catalyst for spreading misinformation. The bottom line is that there are no miracle foods or supplements guaranteed to protect people from novel coronavirus. In addition, there are no EU approved nutrition and health claims that a single food or supplement can fight viral infections, like COVID-19.

                              "text": "\"Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is distancing himself from the unusual ways he earned money before announcing his White House run May 5, but journalists aren\u2019t letting the former Arkansas governor off the hook. Huckabee, who shed about 100 pounds after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, filmed TV and radio infomercials advertising a program to \"\"reverse\"\" diabetes in February and March. Huckabee also lent his email list to carry ads about a looming food shortage and a cancer cure found in the Bible. CBS\u2019\u00a0Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer tried to pin Huckabee down on his business dealings during a May 10 interview that followed a critical column about \"\"Huckabee\u2019s Hucksterism\"\" by National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier. Huckabee\u00a0got testy as he explained the program he endorsed is more about healthy eating than dietary supplements. A bit later, Schieffer moved on to Fournier during a pundit panel discussion for a response. \"\"As you know, there was more to that, and I really like the way you kind of put him on his heels and he had to filibuster you,\"\" Fournier said. \"\"He -- his endorsing -- the infomercials that are endorsing cures and treatments that no health agency supports. He's linking cancer to cures to the Bible verse.\"\" In other words, he said, not very presidential behavior. PunditFact wanted to dig into Fournier\u2019s claim about Huckabee\u2019s past. Did he shill for a shoddy diabetes \"\"cure\"\" that \"\"no health agency supports\"\"? \u2018Diabetes Solution Kit\u2019 Fournier\u2019s column references a March New York Times story about Huckabee\u2019s \"\"highly unconventional income streams.\"\" In a since-deleted video (though you can see one on the Daily Mail), Huckabee encouraged viewers to buy the Diabetes Solution Kit made by the South Dakota company Barton Publishing. In the video, Huckabee promises diabetes can be reversed (\"\"I should know because I did it\"\") and condemns \"\"mainstream\"\" treatment methods of insulin injections and prescriptions. \"\"Prescription drugs aren\u2019t going to cure you,\"\" Huckabee tells viewers. \"\"They\u2019re only going to keep you a loyal pill-popping, finger-pricking, insulin shooting customer so Big Pharma and the mainstream medical community can rake in over $100 billion a year annually.\"\" After explaining how he used \"\"the same techniques\"\" outlined in the Diabetes Solution Kit, Huckabee asks viewers to \"\"sit tight, because in a moment a free presentation is coming up that\u2019ll show you everything you need to know about the Diabetes Solution Kit so you can discover all the natural secrets that are backed by real science that really work.\"\" That free presentation lasts more than 30 minutes, kicking off with a spokesman named Lon showing a picture of cinnamon rolls that \"\"contain a real ingredient that reverses diabetes\"\" and going on to berate insulin, diabetes pills and other injectables as treatments. (We sat through it so you don\u2019t have to.) The kit turns out to be booklets offering tips for eating, exercise, and yes, formulating dietary supplements \u2014 for the low, low price of $19.97. \"\"We don\u2019t sell pills,\"\" said Barton Publishing chief marketing officer Marty Fahncke. \"\"We sell books that do, in fact, teach people how to reverse their diabetes.\"\" However, the video discusses at length the \"\"Double C Diabetes Remedy\"\" of cinnamon and chromium picolinate, which is described as a \"\"weird, spice, kitchen cabinet cure\"\" that \"\"will allow you to live life just like when you didn\u2019t have diabetes at all.\"\" Lon the narrator calls this precise combination of cinnamon and chromium picolinate a \"\"cornerstone\"\" of the system. Huckabee\u2019s campaign did not return an email seeking comment for this story. Huckabee told Schieffer that he is no longer doing the infomercials as a presidential candidate. The Barton Publishing press release about Huckabee\u2019s endorsement deal says he was \"\"given just 10 years to live\"\" by a doctor who diagnosed him with Type 2 diabetes in 2004. This contradicts Huckabee\u2019s own account of his diagnosis as documented by the media. According to the Associated Press, Huckabee was diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes in 2002. He lost 50 pounds within about two months after following a diet created by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. By 2004, he had lost 100 pounds through healthy eating and fitness. Newspaper accounts contain no mention of a cinnamon and chromium compound helping Huckabee through, and Huckabee is careful in the video to avoid saying he followed the Diabetes Solution Kit. The closest he gets is saying the he \"\"used the same techniques to lose 110 pounds of fat, get my own blood sugar under control, and completely reverse my Type 2 diabetes.\"\" Position of diabetes associations So that\u2019s the diabetes solution Huckabee was being paid to promote. The question is: Do health agencies say it works? The New York Times story describes the American Diabetes Association and Canadian Diabetes Association as warning that dietary and herbal supplements \"\"are ineffective for treating diabetes,\"\" linking to a page of only the American group\u2019s website. The ADA\u2019s Diabetes.org page is slightly more nuanced than outright calling the supplements ineffective, but nowhere does it signal support for herbal remedies: \"\"It is best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat. In fact, research has not been able to prove that dietary or herbal supplements (including omega-3 supplements, cinnamon, and other herbs) help to manage diabetes.\"\" The organization cites a National Health Interview Survey that acknowledges use of herbal therapy or dietary supplements among one-fifth or one-third, respectively, of people with diabetes, especially in minority ethnic groups. The Canadian Diabetes Association was more straight-forward: It \"\"does not support the use of the dietary supplements advertised in these infomercials.\"\" Fahncke of Barton Publishing sent PunditFact links to various Web pages of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Diabetes Association, Mayo Clinic, and a journal called Nutrition Research. The links either talk about the importance of a healthy diet to control diabetes (and don\u2019t mention herbal supplements at all) or discuss small studies in China and Pakistan that showed cinnamon supplements might reduce risk factors in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Still, none of the links offer strong support for the cinnamon-chromium mixture recommended in the Diabetes Solution Kit \u2014 much less the endorsement of a reputable health agency. Other expert opinions Other endocrinologists we contacted were more blunt: The promised kitchen cabinet remedy does not work. \"\"There is no scientific support for herbal treatments in the care of diabetes,\"\" said Dr. Domenico Accili, Columbia University professor medicine and director of the Columbia University Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center. \"\"The concoction of cinnamon and chromium has been sold for many years, and it\u2019s pure quackery.\"\" Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, a past president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and attending physician in the endocrinology, diabetes and bone disease division of New York\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital, said even though chromium and cinnamon are \"\"associated with salutary effects on glucose and insulin physiology in animals and in vitro,\"\" there are insufficient clinical data to back up a recommendation for the product. Even though consuming either the spice cinnamon or mineral chromium picolinate is inherently low risk, Mechanick said, there are several reasons to avoid the combined product, including insufficient regulation and a lack of strong science. \"\"The philosophy of using (dietary supplements and nutraceuticals) to manage diabetes instead of proven lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies is harmful,\"\" he said. Food and Drug Administration spokesman Eric Pahon said people who \"\"rely on products which have not been reviewed by FDA for safety and efficacy\"\" \u2014 e.g. Diabetes Solution Kit\u2019s cinnamon and chromium picolinate recommendation \u2014 \"\"may place themselves at increased risk of poorly controlled diabetes and other risks.\"\" Our ruling Fournier said \"\"no health agencies support\"\" the \"\"cures and treatments\"\" that Huckabee endorsed in an infomercial promising diabetes reversal. Health groups and physicians that specialize in diabetes told us they do not support the approach to \"\"reversing diabetes\"\" outlined in the Diabetes Solution Kit that Huckabee used to endorse.\"",

                              "text": "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 08:13 UTC \u00a9 Nutrition Review Mold toxin in cereals, coffee and wine inhibits cell regeneration in the brain. Chronic sinus problems, brain fog, unrelenting fatigue, ice pick headaches, increased gut permeability, and prone to static shocks may be signs of trouble with mold allergies and mold toxins. Sources of molds can easily come from fall foliage decay, water damage from heavy rains, floods, and hurricanes, and even several foods. Exposure to mold leads to not only the common respiratory symptoms, but can cause increased gut permeability and more severe immune disorders like CIRS and Mold-Related Illness. Mold toxins are ubiquitous and must be managed for health. Mold Allergies Mayo Clinic describes mold allergy as similar to other types of upper respiratory allergies. Common symptoms include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, cough and postnasal drip, itchy eyes, nose and throat, watery eyes, and dry, scaly skin. Mold allergy problems may lead to asthma, fungal sinus infections, and allergic reactions in the lung like allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In this context, the mold allergies recognized are IgE reactions. IgE reactions reflect immunological inflammation caused by immediate or acute hypersensitivity. This is the same response as someone who eats peanuts or strawberries and develops hives or has anaphylactic symptoms. Treatment focuses on nasal corticosteroids like Flonase and Omnaris along with antihistamines. Natural support for acute allergic mold symptoms focus on antihistamines, reducing congestion, and blocking immune system chemicals like leukotrienes that lead to excess mucus. A number of antihistamine drugs are modeled after the nutrient quercetin, a natural antihistamine and bioflavonoid found in apples, onions, and other natural foods. Carnosine, chlorella, arabinogalactan, B vitamins, vitamin C, D, tocotrienols and DHA help reduce histamine release, help stabilize the immune (mast) cells that release histamine, and help lymphatic congestion. Antihistamine medications are not without side effects. Benadryl affects acetylcholine and may increase the risk for dementia. Mold Toxins In addition to mold allergies, there is the concern of mold toxins impacting the health of the gut and immune system. Changes in childhood growth, increased gut permeability, autoimmune disorders, and even systemic autoimmune inflammatory reactions, known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) may occur as a result of mold biotoxins or mycotoxins. Mold emits toxins that the body must detoxify. These substances, known as volatile organic compounds or VOCs, produce the musty odor of mold. Some of the gases produced include hexane, benzene, acetone and methylene chloride. These gases are known for their role in upper respiratory inflammation and sick building syndrome. Another toxic substance produced by mold is trichothecenes. Trichothecenes are toxic metabolites or mycotoxins produced by mold or fungus. They are found in the agricultural and food industry worldwide, which poses health hazards for animals and humans alike. Trichothecenes decrease macrophage activity in the immune system, which may increase the susceptibility to bacteria and viruses. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that helps clean up cellular debris, germs, cancer cells, etc. It is the pac-man garbage collector of the immune system. Mold Toxins and Gut Changes Foods contaminated with molds are of concern around the globe. Mycotoxins , like aflatoxin, deoxinivalenol (DON), and fumonisins, etc. effect the intestines and cause significant damage to the gut lining and function. The direct impact includes decreased intestinal cell viability, reductions in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations elimination of beneficial bacteria, increased expression of genes involved in promoting inflammation and counteracting oxidative stress. Researchers report that as technology is able to better measure food contamination to mold toxins, they find \"that a significant proportion of the human population is chronically exposed to DON doses exceeding the provisional maximum tolerable daily dose.\" Recent research demonstrates just how powerful these mold biotoxins are, affecting intestinal function but also damaging immune, endocrine, and neurological function, and stunting the growth process in children . Animal and human studies focus on three major mycotoxins - aflatoxin (AF), fumonisin (FUM), and deoxynivaenol (DON). These different toxins have distinct actions, but they all cause intestinal damage, affect protein synthesis and create inflammation. As a result of consuming foods contaminated with mycotoxins, children in this study experienced environmental enteropathy. This is a low grade chronic condition of the small intestine that causes poor absorption of nutrients and increased intestinal permeability (Leaky Gut Syndrome). The mycotoxin contaminated food causes a breakdown in the villi or fingerlike projections of the gut resulting in inflammation affecting the entire body. Researchers believe that the chronic exposure to mycotoxins in the food supply contributed significantly to loss of growth, wasting, and stunting in these children. This concern is widely present in third world countries, but it certainly raises questions for all, even in affluent countries. Common Mold Toxins in Foods Aflatoxins may be present in many different types of foods. This includes cereals, tree nuts, corn, peanuts/peanut butter, pistachios, Brazil nuts, chilies, black pepper, dried fruit and figs. Milk, cheese, and dairy products may be contaminated with aflatoxins. Fumonisins are primarily found in corn-based products like yellow cornmeal, blue cornmeal, corn muffin mix, and mixed grain cereals. The mold mycotoxin DON (deoxynivaenol) is frequently found infecting grains in the field or during storage . Humans are exposed to it with the consumption of cereal grains like corn, wheat, oats, barley, and rice. Researchers note that it has been detected in buckwheat, popcorn, sorghum, triticale, and other food products including flour, bread, breakfast cereals, noodles, infant foods, pancakes, malt and beer. Pointing out these foods is not meant to make one \"food phobic\" but rather it is to realize that these toxins are ubiquitous and they can be problematic especially if they are a staple to the diet. Certain foods will have more or less amounts than others. Individuals who struggle with mold toxins, leaky gut syndrome, and insufficient antioxidants may need to limit or avoid these foods while their body heals. CIRS - Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Mold biotoxins can have a severe impact on health in those who are genetically susceptible. These biotoxins commonly occur in the environment from water damaged buildings and as noted above from the food supply, etc. Once the source of mold toxins has been removed and the damaged structure repaired, many individuals are able to clear these mold toxins out of the body without trouble. However, it is estimated that almost 25 percent of the population is genetically susceptible to chronic mold illness, which is known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome or CIRS. An older name is \"mixed mold exposure\" . CIRS occurs because of genetic susceptibility with the HLA DR/DQ genes. Individuals who have this gene and the protein (MHC Class II protein) that it commands, fail to recognize mold toxins or biotoxins. The mold biotoxins stay activated in the body and continue to cause inflammation and damage. Until the toxins are cleared out, the chronic inflammation stays smoldering . The same genes also affect how the MHCII proteins recognize Lyme biotoxins. Lab Tests for Severe or Unresolved Concerns If you wonder why you can't get rid of chronic respiratory concerns, ongoing fatigue, and feel like your losing your memory, you may want to look into testing for the HLA DR/DQ (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5 and DQ) mold susceptibility genes. Other labs of great value include TGF-beta, MSH, VEGF, VIP, C4a, C3a, anti-gliadin (gluten) intolerance, ADH, MMP-9, and leptin. Estrogen, progesterone, thyroid and adrenal hormones are also affected by mold toxins leading to deficient or imbalanced levels. Common lab tests that measure inflammation, i.e. CRP and SED rate, are not elevated with mold biotoxins. What Does CIRS Look Like? Symptoms or common diagnoses associated with or affected by CIRS and mold toxins includes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, ulcerative colitis , fibromyalgia, Lyme disease , Hashimoto's thyroiditis, chronic EBV and other herpes viruses, rheumatoid arthritis , brain fog, brain fatigue , Crohn's disease, Celiac disease, poor memory, exercise intolerance, respiratory problems, chronic sinusitis, blood sugar problems, and poor oxygenation . Fatigue, muscle aches, muscle cramps, ice pick headaches/sharp stabbing pain in the head, light sensitivity, morning stiffness, word finding difficulties, decreased academic or work performance, frequent or increased static shocks, appetite changes, vertigo, body temperature dysregulation, diarrhea, and other symptoms may be present. Autoimmune disorders and neurological inflammation should raise the question of mold toxicity. Sudden increase in weight after moving into water damaged building or new work environment may occur due to the inflammatory overload to the brain that leads to leptin resistance . Elevated leptin and weight gain in this context will fail to respond to dietary changes and physical activity. Removal of oneself from the toxic environment is critical followed by mold remediation of the building. Removal of dust particles saturated with mold VOCs is important as these circulate through the air and will continue to affect the mold toxin susceptible individual. Work with mold experts if you suspect or have CIRS and live or work in a water damaged building. How to Help Ease the Toxic Burden One of the most important things that you can do to help your body, i.e. your liver, gut, brain deal with these toxins is to ensure healthy glutathione levels, detoxification and removal of these substances from the body, and gut repair . Support and treatment of mold toxins includes several different nutrients. Mold toxins must be detoxified through the liver and the cytochrome P450 pathway. This detox system relies heavily on adequate glutathione and SOD enzymatic antioxidant pathways which require several nutrients. This includes B vitamins, NAC, MSM sulfur, acetyl-l-carnitine, lipoic acid, taurine, choline, glycine, glutamine, arginine, manganese, iron, coenzyme Q10, zinc, copper, silymarin, omega 3 fish oils, vitamin A, C, and E, and others. It is also helpful to support healthy gall bladder and bile acid function to help bind onto and clear mold toxins. Friendly flora/gut bacteria, fiber , lipoic acid, oregano oil , chlorella , or d-limonene help support this process. By supporting glutathione, cytochrome P 450 system, bile acids and gall bladder, the body stands a better chance in clearing out the VOCs and inflammatory compounds that mold exposure creates. Rebuilding and healing of the damaged gut lining is just as essential as the detoxification of mold toxins to stop autoimmune, endocrine, and neurological injury. Leaky Gut Syndrome repair relies heavily on vitamin D, vitamin A, glutamine, omega 3 oils, the good omega-6 oil GLA, and probiotics. Curcumin, boswellia, and resveratrol provide vital anti-inflammatory support for the gut and also the brain. Use enough digestive enzyme support to help breakdown all food types and reduce the strain on the gut and immune system. For those who have CIRS, other steps and medical support may be needed. Mold toxins are invariably present. It is a matter of how we handle their toxic effects or if we struggle under the burden of this environmental challenge. Genetics, exposure amounts, and efficiency and efficacy of the detoxification pathways determine the outcome of this equation. If you feel worse in certain environments or by consuming foods with these toxins, then it may be time to remediate the damaging effects of mold. Nutritional Options Chlorella - This blue-green algae super food packs power when it comes to detoxification. Chlorella binds onto toxins in a safe manner without stressing the liver, gut, or gall bladder. Quality of chlorella varies in the industry. Choose only chlorella grown indoors that is free of environmental toxins. A very thin or semi-permeable cell membrane is preferred over a broken cell membrane. B Vitamins - B vitamins are essential for detoxification and the cytochrome P 450 system. Several of the B vitamins are required for glutathione production and antioxidant function. Given the demands of today's world, B vitamin replenishment and support is a must. Omega-3 and -6 oils - The omega-3 oil DHA and the omega-6 oil GLA are critical in protecting the brain and body from inflammation. The gut lining requires DHA and GLA to heal when increased permeability exists. Vitamin A - This often overlooked vitamin is essential for the epithelial lining of the gut as well as the mucosal lining of the sinuses and lungs. Without adequate vitamin A, the immune system struggles to maintain integrity. Those who struggle with thyroid concerns may not be able to convert beta carotene into vitamin A. Oregano Oil - This spice provides powerful anti-fungal support. It also demonstrates anti-inflammatory and antihistamine benefits. We have used oregano oil for many chronic sinus and respiratory concerns for nearly 25 years with great results. Many low quality forms of oregano oil add olive, soy, or other oils. It is best to use a product free of added, unnecessary ingredients. Silymarin - Silymarin is the active ingredient of milk thistle extract. It has been shown highly protective to the liver and is essential for the cytochrome P 450 system. In addition to its benefits for detoxification, it helps to recycle glutathione and acts a natural anti-inflammatory compound for the liver and brain. Fiber - Fiber is critical to binding onto toxins dumped into the gut. This includes the toxins from the liver and gall bladder. Arabinogalactan fiber and oat bran fiber provide excellent forms of soluble and insoluble fibers. In order to clear toxins and keep the bowels moving, it is often very helpful to increase fiber intake to 30 - 50 grams of fiber per day. Today's diets often have very low fiber intakes of 8-10 grams per day.",

                              "text": "By Dr. Mercola\nAs noted at the very beginning of this 26-minute health documentary by juicing expert Jason Vale: \u201cMore people die from chronic diseases than all other causes put together.\u201d\nThis is a remarkable state of affairs when you consider that the human body is actually designed to maintain healthy homeostasis, given half a chance.\nWhat\u2019s worse, chronic diseases strike the very young as well as the very old. Children are now developing diseases previously relegated to seniors, such as type 2 diabetes , fatty liver, heart disease and even cancer.\nToxicity appears to be a major factor driving this burgeoning wave of chronic disease. Toxins are in our food, in our water and air, in the medications we take, in the products we use each day to clean ourselves and our homes; they\u2019re in beauty products and our furnishings and building materials.\n\u201cAll chronic diseases are caused by two, and only two, major problems,\u201d Charlotte Gerson, founder of the Gerson Institute, says . \u201cToxicity and deficiency.\u201d \nTOXICITY AND DEFICIENCY ARE CORE PROBLEMS According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), PREVENTABLE chronic diseases are now the world\u2019s biggest killers. And the combination of eating nutrient-deficient foods and being over-exposed to toxins is at the core of our current health crisis.\nThe answer to this dilemma is certainly not to take medication to mask the symptoms of toxicity and deficiency. The solution is to remove toxins, clean up your system and increase the nutrient density of your healthy food.\nPlants \u2014 fruits, berries and vegetables \u2014 are \u201clive\u201d foods. Provided they\u2019ve not been severely processed, or are eaten in excess and out of season. Ideally, the best time to eat fruit is in the summer when you have plenty of exposure to sunshine and can tolerate higher net carbs.\nThey contain many phytochemicals your body can use to heal and nourish your cells. The appeal of juicing is that you can consume more nutrient-dense vegetables than when you eat them whole or Vita Mix them in a blender.\nThis allows you to consume far greater amounts of vegetable nutrients than you would normally be able to eat whole or blended with the fiber.\nJUICING IS A GREAT WAY TO BOOST NUTRIENT INTAKE Some will argue that consuming more veggies than you could normally chew through is unnecessary, but when you consider how nutrient levels in most foods have dramatically decreased since the introduction of mechanized farming in 1925, juicing really makes sense.\nHealthy soils contain a huge diversity of microorganisms, and it is these organisms that are responsible for the plant\u2019s nutrient uptake, health and the stability of the entire ecosystem.\nThe wide-scale adoption of industrial farming practices has decimated soil microbes responsible for transferring these minerals to the plants, and synthetic chemicals sprayed on the crops have further destroyed overall soil quality.\nFor example, as explained by research scientist August Dunning , chief science officer and co-owner of Eco Organics, in order to receive the same amount of iron you used to get from one apple in 1950, today you\u2019d have to eat 36 apples!\nHow could you possibly get 36 apples into you? Even with juicing that would be a remarkable feat, and would likely overload you with natural sugars as well, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\nMy point is that even when juicing, you may not get the same amount of nutrients our ancestors used to get from even a fraction of the foods they ate, so you\u2019re unlikely to get superfluous amounts of nutrients by regularly drinking fresh vegetable juices.\nWhen you drink fresh, live juice, it\u2019s almost like receiving an intravenous infusion of vitamins, minerals and enzymes because they go straight into your body without needing to be broken down. Since juicing is essentially \u201cmainlining\u201d live nutrients, it\u2019s no surprise it can produce rapid and profound health benefits.\nFOOD ADDICTION IS A PROFIT CENTER There\u2019s a conscious effort on behalf of food manufacturers to get you addicted to foods that are convenient and inexpensive to make. This system is detailed in investigative reporter Michael Moss\u2019 book, \u201c Salt, Sugar, Fat \u201d \u2014 the top three substances that make processed foods so addictive.\nOne of the guiding principles for the processed food industry is known as \u201csensory-specific satiety.\u201d Moss describes this as \u201cthe tendency for big, distinct flavors to overwhelm your brain, which responds by depressing your desire to have more.\u201d\nThe greatest successes, whether beverages or foods, owe their \u201ccraveability\u201d to complex formulas that pique your taste buds just enough, without overwhelming them, thereby overriding your brain\u2019s inclination to say \u201cenough.\u201d\n\u201cVanishing calorie density\u201d is another term used to describe foods that melt in your mouth, which has the effect of making your brain think it doesn\u2019t contain any calories. As a result, you keep eating.\nIn short, as noted in the film, the big food companies are \u201cmanipulating our food so that we keep eating more, and more, and more.\u201d And, as stated by Cherie Calbom, also known as \u201cThe Juice Lady:\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s corn and soy, and wheat and sugar and salt and chemicals \u2014 that\u2019s primarily what people are eating.\u201d\nSo is it really any wonder that so many are so sick and overweight? Many health authorities make it seem as the obesity epidemic is a great mystery, and largely blame it on laziness. \u201cIf only people exercised more, they\u2019d be fine,\u201d the reasoning goes.\nBut this simply isn\u2019t true, and by sweeping the proverbial elephant under the rug and ignoring the fact that our food supply is the problem, these authorities have done us all a shameful disservice.\nRemember, it really isn\u2019t about calories, it is about insulin resistance. And processed foods, sugars and high net carb foods will make it virtually impossible to normalize your metabolism and get lean.\nMODERN MEDICINE IS ANOTHER PROFIT CENTER Many times, even severe health problems have simple fixes. For example, in the film, Vale, who\u2019s also the author of \u201cThe Juice Detox Diet,\u201d explains that what prompted him to try juicing in the first place was a severe case of psoriasis \u2014 an autoimmune disease that causes cells to build up on the surface of your skin, leading to thick, unsightly scaly patches that are very itchy and often painful.\nHe also had eczema and severe hay fever and asthma. For years he used steroid tablets and various inhalers to manage his symptoms, but he wasn\u2019t getting any better. \u201cNot once did anyone look at what might be causing the problems; they only wanted to treat the symptoms,\u201d he said.\nThe turning point came when one of his doctors suggested a coal-tar treatment for his psoriasis. He\u2019d be slathered in coal-tar, the same gooey tar placed on roadways, and covered in bandages for six weeks. The idea of resorting to such a bizarre and clearly toxic intervention was the final straw. \u201cThere\u2019s GOT to be another way,\u201d he thought.\nIndeed, toxicity and a narrow focus on managing symptoms \u2014 not actually addressing the root problem, which might result in a full remission or cure \u2014 are hallmarks of modern medicine. This mode of operation has turned healthcare into a massive for-profit business that has become increasingly reluctant to embrace strategies that might actually remove an individual from the paying patient pool.\nThis is tragic, since research exists showing that raising your vitamin D level, for example, can help heal psoriasis, especially if you\u2019re vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D supplements are very inexpensive, and if you optimize your level by getting regular and sensible sun exposure, which is the preferred and ideal way, it\u2019s free (provided you live in a sunny area and don\u2019t use a therapeutic sunbed).\nIn Vale\u2019s case, juicing was the answer, and he no longer suffers from any of his previous problems. His asthma completely vanished within a month, and his skin gradually cleared up until there was not a trace of psoriasis or eczema left. His weight also dropped \u201cat a rate I didn\u2019t think was humanly possible,\u201d he says. As noted by Dr. Dwight Lundell, author of \u201cThe Cure for Heart Disease,\u201d who is featured in the film:\n\u201cNot one single person will be cured of heart disease, pulmonary disease, stroke, arthritis, obesity and, of course, diabetes, with our current medical approach.\u201d \nINFLAMMATION IS THE DRIVING MECHANISM BEHIND MOST CHRONIC DISEASE Toxicity, nutrient deficiencies , processed foods, sugar and excess net carbs promote inflammation, and chronic inflammation is a hallmark of virtually every chronic disease there is. When your inflammation levels are low, it\u2019s very difficult for disease to take root. When healthy, your body is simply too well-equipped to address foreign invaders and can easily clean out minor toxic exposures.\nAs noted by Lundell, when we investigate what we\u2019re doing differently today, when inflammation levels are high, compared to decades past when chronic disease rates were much lower, the main difference we find is the foods we eat.\nWe\u2019ve gotten away from eating fresh, whole foods, most of which come from the plant kingdom, and most of what we eat are processed foods laced with a myriad of chemicals that were never in our food supply before. \u201cIn my opinion, this dietary change is the cause of most chronic diseases,\u201d he says.\nIt may appear as though all these different chronic diseases are very different, and therefore would have different causes. But these variations are deceiving. In the vast majority of cases, the root problem can be narrowed down to inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by toxicity and insufficient amounts of \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d (nutrients) to maintain optimal biological function. The differences in manifestation primarily relate to individual weaknesses.\n\u201cIt just stands to reason and common sense that if the vast majority of those diseases are caused by diet and lifestyle, then the simple answer, surely, is to change the diet and lifestyle, and they\u2019ll just get better,\u201d Vale says.\nCalbom adds: \u201cWe should be juicing, because so many people have impaired digestive tracts, and digestion is impaired because of the diet we\u2019ve been on. Along come your beautiful juices; they go right into your intestinal tract, and those nutrients get absorbed into your system. \nThey\u2019re going right to work within about 20 or 30 minutes. They\u2019re there feeding your body, rejuvenating, giving you energy; giving your body life! This is why you should juice \u2026 Juice every day; this has got to be a way of life, because that\u2019s when you\u2019re going to notice your life changing.\u201d \nEAT \u2018LOW HUMAN INTERVENTION FOODS\u2019 Vale wisely suggests that if a food has a label, it probably shouldn\u2019t be in your diet. What you\u2019re really looking for is real food, or what he calls \u201clow human intervention foods,\u201d meaning foods that has passed through as few human hands and processes as possible. Ideally, you would be growing your own food and eating out of your garden.\nIn the summer, the majority of my main meal comes from my garden: sunflower spouts, red bell peppers, oregano, rosemary, turmeric and spinach. If you are unable to grow your own, your next best bet would be to get locally grown organic produce that has not been waxed, cut up or processed in any way.\n\u201cWhen you look at the fact that the food you eat really creates the life that you live, everything starts to change,\u201d Philip McCluskey, author of \u201cWeight Loss Blueprint,\u201d says.\n\u2018SUPER-JUICING\u2019 FOR 28 DAYS CURED DIABETES AND CHRONIC PAIN \nIn a previous documentary, Vale recruited eight people who collectively suffered from 22 different chronic diseases and put them on a juice-only diet for 28 days (plus exercise) in order to explore juicing\u2019s potential benefits for reversing chronic disease. He filmed their experience, which resulted in the documentary \u201cSuper Juice Me,\u201d which I\u2019ve included above for your convenience.\nThe health improvements seen by those eight individuals are nothing short of astounding. Every participant felt energized and lost weight, and most reported a drastic reduction in their symptoms and the number of medications they needed to use. One man completely resolved his diabetes in those 28 days. A woman went from years of chronic pain to being completely pain-free, and others suffering from asthma, colitis and sleep apnea enjoyed a profound reduction in symptoms.\nIt was not an easy journey, as several experienced detoxification reactions, food cravings and, for some, a temporary increase in symptoms as their bodies began to purge toxins they\u2019d accumulated, but those reactions were relatively short-lived, and they felt immensely better on the other side \u2014 better than they\u2019d felt in years.\nTHE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS OF JUICING There are many reasons to consider incorporating vegetable juicing into your health plan. Whether you use it as an occasional cleanse, or as the start of every morning, juicing:\nHelps you absorb all the nutrients from your vegetables. This is important because most people have impaired digestion as a result of making less-than-optimal food choices over many years, which limits your body\u2019s ability to absorb all of the nutrients in whole, raw vegetables. Juicing helps \u201cpre-digest\u201d them, so you won\u2019t lose any of this valuable nutrition. Makes it easier to consume a large quantity of vegetables. Virtually every health authority recommends that you get six to eight servings of vegetables and fruits per day, but very few actually get that. Juicing virtually guarantees you\u2019ll reach your daily target. Makes it easier to get a wider variety of vegetables into your diet. Juicing greatly expands the number of different phytochemicals you receive, as each vegetable offers unique benefits. Juicing also allows you to consume vegetables that you may not normally enjoy eating whole. Boosts your immune system. Raw juice supercharges your immune system with concentrated phytochemicals and biophotonic light energy, which can revitalize your body. The nutrients in fresh juice also feed your body\u2019s good bacteria and help suppress potentially pathogenic ones. Increases your energy. When your blood is flooded with nutrients and your body\u2019s pH is optimized, you\u2019ll feel energized. Since juice is absorbed and utilized by your body very rapidly, juicers report feeling an almost instantaneous \u201ckick\u201d of energy. Supports your brain. In the Kame Project, 1 people who consumed juice more than three times per week were 76 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease than those who consumed juice less than once a week. Provides structured water. Vegetable juice is one of the purest sources of water and actually qualifies as water. Vegetable water is structured water (living water), which is different from regular water \u2014 H3O2 rather than H2O. Water from vegetables is the best quality water you can drink!On a side note, sun exposure is also important for structuring the water in your cells. Part of the energy your body requires can actually be obtained from sunlight, but you must expose your skin directly to it. The ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases nitric oxide (NO) release, which can direct more than half your blood flow to your skin. Once your blood is exposed to the sun, it can absorb UV and infrared radiation, which help to structure the water in your cells and energize your mitochondria. \n \n\nDownload Interview Transcript Keep in mind your juices should consist mostly of green vegetables. You\u2019ll want to minimize fruits in order to keep the fructose and net carb content low. The bulk of your juice should come from organic green veggies. Spinach, celery, kale and Swiss chard are common juicing staples.\nIf you\u2019re new to juicing, you can start with more mild-tasting veggies, like celery and cucumbers. From there you can work your way up to red leaf lettuce, romaine, spinach and escarole, along with parsley and cilantro. Kale, collard, dandelion, mustard and other greens can be bitter, so you\u2019ll want to start slowly and add just a few leaves at a time.\nSome of the most nutrient-dense veggies are the strongest tasting, but don\u2019t avoid them. Just use a lesser quantity in your juice until your taste buds acclimate. Selecting organic, non-GMO produce is very important when juicing, but the price can be a challenge for some. One alternative is to grow your own, making sure to avoid toxic garden chemicals (synthetic herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers).\nIf you\u2019re using non-organic vegetables, your best bet is to peel them, to avoid juicing pesticide residues. This is particularly important for fruits and vegetables that have been waxed, as this seals in the chemicals. It can be difficult to discern if a vegetable has been waxed or not, because the wax can be applied in a very thin, transparent layer.\nBeware that even organic produce sold in grocery chain stores will typically be waxed. For unwaxed fruit and vegetables, you typically have to get them from a local source.\nTIPS THAT CAN MAKE YOUR VEGGIE JUICE MORE PALATABLE If you\u2019re not used to eating a lot of vegetables, the taste may take a little while to get used to. A great trick to make your juice more palatable, especially in the beginning, is to add one or more of these elements:\nLimes and lemons: You can add one half to a whole lime or lemon for every quart of juice. Limes are my favorite for cutting bitter flavors. Cranberries: You can also add some cranberries if you enjoy them. Limit the cranberries to about 4 ounces per pint of juice. Fresh ginger : This is an excellent addition if you enjoy the taste. It gives your juice a spicy \u201ckick.\u201d Limited amounts of apple and carrot (just be mindful of your overall sugar content). HOW TO MANAGE CRAVINGS AND DETOX SYMPTOMS Changing your diet or any other aspect of your lifestyle is sometimes stressful, and stress can sabotage your success. As some of the people in Vale\u2019s super-juicing experiment discovered, you might feel a little worse before you feel better, as detox symptoms and food cravings can arise. Addressing your emotional and mental health is a very important aspect of total body health, so please do not ignore stress.\nThe Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) can be helpful when anxieties strike, including emotional struggles surrounding dietary changes. In fact, it\u2019s one of the most powerful tools for reducing stress and anxiety that I know of. In 2012, a triple blind study 2 found that EFT reduced cortisol levels and symptoms of psychological distress by 24 percent, more than any other intervention tested!\nIf you worry that you won\u2019t be able to get the juice down or you won\u2019t take the time to do it, or your food cravings will be unbearable, EFT may be able to help. The first couple weeks of a new eating routine are typically the most challenging, while your body is making the necessary biochemical adjustments. Tapping can be extraordinarily beneficial for reducing anxiety, cravings and detox symptoms during this time.\nEFT is easy to learn and once you do, it\u2019s always at your fingertips, whenever and wherever you need it. You can even adapt this intermittent fasting EFT video by Julie Schiffman for juice fasting. Just as juicing helps reduce your body\u2019s toxic burden, you can think of EFT as detoxification for your mind. By combining the two, your healing will have the greatest chance of success.\n\nSource: Mercola \n",

                              "text": "posted by Eddie F or centuries people have been looking into their teacups to find answers in the tea leaves. These brews and herbs have always held a spiritual energy . When you take time to make yourself a soothing cup of herbal tea, you are allowing yourself to go within. You soften your thoughts and begin to hear the voice of your intuition. The Art of Spiritual Tea Making In our current convenience-focused age, many just grab a tea bag and pop it into a cup of hot water. This instant tea is really just flavored water. If you want to gain all the spiritual benefits that a healing herbal infusion has to offer, you need to take some time in preparing it. Tea is best made in a closed vessel\u2014either a teapot or a cup with a small saucer placed on top to serve as a lid. When you brew tea this way, you allow the beautiful aromatic qualities to recirculate back into the liquid. You know that uplifting fragrance emanating from peppermint tea? Well, that represents most of the spiritually healing herbal oils floating off into the atmosphere. If you brew it in a teapot or cup with a lid, the steam condenses back into the infusion. For most herbal teas and for maximum spiritual benefit to be had, you\u2019ll want to brew it for at least five minutes in boiling water. You can allow your tea to brew longer and get an even more potent spiritually activating herbal infusion . A general rule is one teaspoon of herb per cup of water, plus one extra for the teapot. So if your teapot holds two cups of water, you would add three teaspoons of herb. Spiritual Properties of Various Herbs, Plants and Teas Calendula Calendula is a powerful spiritual herb that will bring healing as well as activate your innate healing abilities. When you drink calendula, you stand tall as a powerful healer. This tea repairs your aura and brings energetic protection. Chamomile Chamomile helps attract abundance. This pleasant tasting spiritual herb relaxes your energy, which allows you to become receptive. The Universe and God always have your best interests in mind. When things seem challenging, it can be for one of two reasons: You are trying to go in a different direction than where you are truly being guided, or you are unwilling to receive help and support along the way. When you drink chamomile, you let down your guard and let in the healing love of God and your angels. Fennel Fennel tea (made from the seeds) can help reduce sugar cravings. On an energetic level it gives you a \u201cpat on the back.\u201d As a healer or reader, you may focus on helping others rather than devoting time to yourself. By drinking this herbal, spiritually enhancing infusion, you remember that it\u2019s okay to have a rest every now and then. You can relax, take a day off, and just enjoy life. Ginger Ginger tea releases anger and frustration. It helps you let go of resentment and jealousy, bringing you to a place of contentment and balance. Hibiscus Hibiscus tea makes a wonderful ruby-colored infusion. It allows you to accept your sensitive side. Know that being sensitive isn\u2019t a weakness; it\u2019s an asset! By picking up on the subtle energies around you, you will know much more easily when you should move on. The spiritual plant hibiscus brings you and your loved ones together. It heals past wounds and promotes forgiveness. Lavender Lavender is a legendary spiritually rejuvenating herb that relaxes your mind and quiets the ego voice. It is beautiful before a meditation, as it resonates with the third-eye chakra\u2014your center of clairvoyance. This summons psychic visions and intuitive insights. Lavender brings a deeper spiritual understanding . This herb helps cast away any fears about embracing your spiritual gifts. Lemongrass Lemongrass is a lesser known spiritual herb that wards off distractions and procrastination. If you are struggling to get something done and finding many excuses not to do it, then you need lemongrass tea! It brings you clarity of purpose so you can get to work. It also shows you the tremendous benefit that completing this task will serve both you and others. Lemongrass sharpens your focus and stops people from interrupting your important job. Nettle tea Nettle tea is great for when you feel worn-out and drained. It is a highly nutritious infusion that supports your body physically. It provides energetic protection , giving you time to recharge. As your body and mind reset, you learn new ways to handle situations. Understand the lessons involved in your current situation and you won\u2019t have to repeat them. Peppermint Peppermint is a common yet still powerful spiritual plant that helps motivate and inspire you, bringing you new creative ideas on how to achieve your dreams . It clears and balances the sacral and solar-plexus chakras, lending you confidence and self-esteem. Rose Rose tea is an ancient, sacred spiritual herb that opens your heart. It attracts compassion; understanding; healing; and, of course, love. When drinking this tea, you become very aware of your language. Every word you speak will have the essence of love attached to it. All your communications will be uplifting and centered around healing. You\u2019ll find that you have no time for gossip or negativity. Instead, you will become an inspiration to those around you\u2014who will wonder why you are so peaceful and then will want to join you on that path of tranquility. Rosemary Rosemary may not be an herb you\u2019d commonly think of for tea. It tastes exactly like you\u2019d expect, but the energy is beautiful! Rosemary has an affinity for the head area. It clears away unwanted thoughts, lifts negative thinking in favor of a positive attitude, and assists with concentration. Rosemary resonates with the third-eye chakra and releases pressure surrounding your spiritual path, making it a great spiritual herb to keep on hand. Allow yourself to enjoy this wonderful journey, and don\u2019t put unnecessary deadlines in place. Saffron Saffron tea sounds so indulgent and somewhat royal. And saffron is the most expensive herb in the world. Thankfully, you only need the smallest amount to make a very powerful spiritually activating tea. Add five to ten good quality saffron threads (parts of the pistil of a crocus) to a cup of boiling water. Allow to steep for a minimum of ten minutes so the saffron can fully give itself to the water. Research trials have shown that saffron helps ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and feelings of depression. Spiritually, saffron unlocks the mysteries of the Universe, allowing you to learn deep, esoteric concepts. It awakens and clears all your energy centers and connects you to God, making it an essential spiritual herb for the seeker. Thyme Thyme is another spiritual herb you might not have considered brewing. This tea opens up your centers of communication and resonates with the throat chakra to help you speak and write with passion and purpose. If you\u2019re finding it difficult to express yourself, try thyme tea. How to Take Herbal Medicines As a sensitive and spiritual person, you may not need high doses of herbal supplements, as your body is receptive to these healing compounds and will immediately begin to utilize them. Where it may take others three to four weeks to observe a change, you might see improvements in just a matter of days. You understand that what you eat changes your entire energy. You\u2019ve noticed that you can\u2019t handle certain foods or drinks because they just don\u2019t agree with your delicate body. So, before you dive into high doses of spiritual herbs , check in with your intuitive feelings. Herbal medicines come in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, teas, liquid extracts, and tinctures. Whichever form you choose, please ensure it\u2019s sourced from a reliable company, sustainably harvested, and organic or wild-crafted. This will give you the best results, as well as the highest energy and spiritual activation. Any form of spiritual herb will have a healing influence, yet there is something especially powerful about a liquid. When you take a tincture, it brings through the energy and vibration of the spiritual plant. Add the appropriate dose to a small glass of water. The amount of water isn\u2019t important as long as you drink the entirety. If you are on any other medications or have preexisting health concerns, please always check with your health-care practitioner before starting any herbal medicines. Elder (Sambucus nigra) Elder (Sambucus nigra) is available in two forms\u2014the berry and the flower. Elderberry is an excellent antiviral. In this case, though, we are more interested in the elder flowers, as they help promote sweating. The elder tree has a long history connected to ancient mysticism. Even farmers would refer to the spirit of this tree as the \u201cElder Mother.\u201d This spiritual herb has a powerful energy that awakens your intuition and opens your chakras . Elder flowers have a connection to the head and are excellent for people with constant colds, runny noses, or hay fever. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a warming herb that stimulates your circulation. As your blood spreads through the superficial layers of your skin, it clears the eccrine glands. The ginger carries with it the nutrition that\u2019s available to your body. Think of it like a courier transporting your vitamins and minerals to the locations that need them most. Along with this nutrition, your energy also flows through the same path. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the blood and energy/vital force follow one another. So if your circulation is stimulated, so too is your energy, and therefore your intuition. Peppermint (Mentha x piperita) Peppermint (Mentha x piperita) helps stimulate the eccrine glands and soothe an upset stomach. You may have noticed that when you have a cup of spiritually activating peppermint tea, your hands sometimes feel warmer. This doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does, it shows that the energy in your palm chakras has been awakened. Your hands are now more sensitive to energy, and you can use them as a natural divination tool. When you meet someone for the first time and shake hands, trust the impression that you receive. Peppermint tea will help you have more confidence in these intuitive messages . Heart-Healthy Herbs Herbal medicines have both physical and energetic properties. These heart-healthy spiritual herbs nourish and protect your physical heart, stimulate your heart chakra, and also heal you emotionally. Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) is a legendary tonic spiritual herb that nourishes the heart. It may balance blood pressure, as well as help you better cope with stress. Astragalus is a wonderful regulator for the body. It corrects imbalances and helps you overcome any obstacles. Dan Shen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) Dan Shen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) is a spiritual herb that has a strong connection to the heart. It balances blood pressure and prevents your blood from becoming too thick. Dan Shen protects the heart and can reduce palpitations. This herb can be helpful when people have a fiery energy about them, seeming angry and aggressive. A red face that comes from anger or high blood pressure can be a sign that this herb is needed. Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) is one of my favorite heart-healing spiritual herbs. I use it for both the physical and emotional heart. On a physical level, it protects the heart muscle. It nourishes this precious organ, helping strengthen and regulate it. Emotionally and energetically, it soothes a broken heart. I\u2019ve used it for healing grief; difficult relationships; and feelings of being taken advantage of by friends, family, or partners. Hawthorn has a gentle energy, like a comforting friend giving you support. Korean Ginseng (Panax ginseng) Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng) is a powerful, tonic spiritual herb that deserves a great deal of respect. It stimulates and awakens the whole body. In contrast to the way caffeine stimulates, Korean ginseng heals and restores. It nourishes the heart and clears feelings of debility. Korean ginseng allows you to cope with stressful situations in a healthy way, and has even shown an ability to increase mental alertness and memory. Taking a dose just before an exam can help you remember more information\u2014an effect made even more powerful when you combine it with ginkgo. Source: by Doreen Virtue and Robert Reeves, N.D.

                              "text": "Tesco dried goji berries, \u00a31.75 for 100g SWAP FOR: Orange pepper, 40p Resembling tiny dried chillies, goji berries are grown in parts of Asia and are available in most supermarkets. They can be eaten just like raisins \u2014 used on top of porridge or in rice dishes, for example. They are said to be packed with zeaxanthin, a compound thought to help prevent age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of sight loss. Resembling tiny dried chillies, goji berries are grown in parts of Asia and are available in most supermarkets There is between 100mg and 150mg zeaxanthin per 100g of dried goji. But peppers are a cheaper, more reliable source. Though they are lower in the compound (at 37mg zeaxanthin per 100g), we eat peppers in larger quantities. Goji berries also contain a polysaccharide (a complex carbohydrate) that research on mice has suggested may help stop tumour growth and regulate blood sugar. But most studies use purified extracts of these active ingredients in far higher quantities than in the fruit. SAVING FOR A FAMILY (FOUR PORTIONS): 50p (1 heaped tbsp compared with one pepper per person) COCONUT OIL Tesco organic virgin coconut oil, \u00a33 for 300ml SWAP FOR: Tesco pure vegetable oil, 99p for 1 litre Coconut oil is said to promote thermogenesis, which is the process where calories are burnt off as heat, rather than stored as fat. In 1981, a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that unusual medium-chain triglycerides \u2014 a form of saturated fat \u2014 found in coconut oil could promote this process. Other claims that have been made include that it can fight Alzheimer's disease \u2014 it's said to contain compounds that act like brain food, though there is very little evidence to support this, according to the Alzheimer's Society. Coconut oil is said to promote thermogenesis, which is the process where calories are burnt off as heat, rather than stored as fat The saturated fat in coconut oil may be a healthier type, but it contains more than 90 per cent saturated fat, compared with less than 60 per cent in butter. And it has as many calories as any other oil (135 per tablespoon). 'If you do eat coconut oil, I'd recommend still trying to keep your overall saturate intake within the recommended guideline of 20g,' says dietitian Helen Bond. 'For everyday use, try a monounsaturated oil such as rapeseed or olive. The benefits of these \u2014 for heart health, in particular \u2014 are much better documented.' Supermarket oils that are simply labelled 'vegetable oil' are invariably rapeseed oil, as is the case with this inexpensive Tesco one. SAVING FOR A FAMILY MEAL: 54p (1 tbsp per person) CHIA SEEDS The Chia Co black chia seeds, \u00a35 for 150g bag SWAP FOR: Sainsbury's sesame seeds, 85p for 100g bag Chia seeds \u2014 which can be sprinkled on baked goods, salads, yoghurts or porridge \u2014 come from a flowering plant typically found in South America. They are rightly promoted as super seeds, as chia is a rich source of vitamins and minerals and very rich in fibre. Yet sesame seeds are even more nutritious. Chia seeds \u2014 which can be sprinkled on baked goods, salads, yoghurts or porridge \u2014 come from a flowering plant typically found in South America Gram for gram they are five times higher in the cell-protective antioxidant vitamin E, twice as high in the B vitamin folate, vital for red blood cell formation and richer in calcium, magnesium, iron and copper \u2014 associated with healthy bones, blood and immune system. Sesame does not boast the heart-healthy and anti-inflammatory omega-3s that chia seeds do, but if you eat one or two portions of oily fish a week, this is not an issue. Plus, oily fish provides the long-chain form of omega-3s that we need, while the form from plant sources has to be converted to this form, a process which the body does not do efficiently. SAVING FOR A FAMILY: \u00a31 (1 tbsp per person) CACAO Bioglan organic raw cacao powder, \u00a38.49 for 100g SWAP FOR: Bournville cocoa, \u00a31.95 for 125g Cacao and cocoa are derived from the cacao bean, but cocoa powder is the more processed form. The health benefits derive from flavonols \u2014 components in the bean thought to contribute to cognitive function and heart health. Cacao is a buzzword for a 'healthier' version, but it depends on how it's been processed. Most purveyors of 'raw' cacao (such as this Bioglan product) say they leave the beans unroasted and that this lack of heat treatment leaves higher levels of flavonols. Cacao and cocoa are derived from the cacao bean, but the powder is the more processed form But it's a confusing area. 'Raw cacao could mean anything and might just be an excuse to market a hugely expensive product with no extra benefits to a normal cup of cocoa,' says Helen Bond. What's more relevant is whether the cocoa or cacao powder has been 'alkalised' \u2014 washed with a chemical that reduces its acidity. Reputable studies, including one published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry in 2008, suggest that alkalising, or 'Dutching', to reduce bitterness, lowers levels of flavanols. The colour gives a clue \u2014 very dark powders, whether raw cacao or standard cocoa, are alkalised and those with a browny-red hue are not. But choose unsweetened cocoa such as this Bournville one.

It's usually dried into a powder and available from health stores, sold as a shot from trendy juice cafes or on the internet (you can also buy the grass and then juice it yourself). It's claimed that chlorophyll, the green pigment in wheatgrass, gets into the bloodstream where it mimics haemoglobin (the red blood pigment that carries oxygen around the body), helping to boost energy. Wheatgrass is the dark- green juice squeezed from young shoots of wheat. It's usually dried into a powder and available from health stores However, according to Helen Bond, this is based on the incorrect logic that because chlorophyll and haemoglobin have similar chemical structures, they will have similar effects in the body. 'Chlorophyll is broken down by our digestive system,' she says. In fact, the British Dietetic Association says that gram for gram, the nutrient content of wheatgrass juice is roughly equivalent to common vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli. But unlike wheatgrass, broccoli counts as a vegetable portion, so you'd be better off having a side of broccoli with your meal or a handful of spinach in a salad.

However, studies have generally been carried out using large doses of the purified compound injected into mice. Shiitake mushrooms contain a compound called lentinan, which, according to Chinese medicine, can stimulate the immune system and even fight cancer This is unlikely to translate into benefit for human beings eating the mushrooms, according to a review of the health benefits of 'medicinal' mushrooms published in the journal Fungal Biology in April. Standard white mushrooms are actually better than shiitake for levels of selenium \u2014 an important mineral that may help improve the immune system's ability to deal with viruses. They're also higher in potassium, for healthy blood pressure and the B vitamin pantothenic acid that helps to release energy from food.

It trades on its per 100g nutrition information, but falls down when you realise the average dose (in a daily smoothie) is no more than around 10g, or 1 tbsp. This amount of Naturya spirulina provides 33mg calcium and 30mg magnesium (4 per cent and 8 per cent of the recommended daily amount, RDA, of these bone-friendly nutrients). Spirulina is a type of blue-green algae farmed in ponds \u2014 in India and Hawaii, for example \u2014 and then harvested and dried But you get 17 per cent of your calcium RDA and 12 per cent of your magnesium from a salad containing 80g of spinach (which will also count as one of your five-a-day and provides more iron). There is insufficient evidence to rate claims that blue-green algae, including spirulina, can help with fatigue, diabetes, anxiety and depression, according to a review funded by the U.S. government last year. Spirulina does contain vitamin B12, which is important for a healthy nervous system. Non-vegans can get this vitamin from dairy, eggs, fish and meat instead.

They also contain iron (which helps protect against fatigue) and calcium (important for bone health). Therefore, people may assume that almond milk has the same qualities, but, in fact, it is only 2 per cent almond (its biggest ingredient is water). Almonds are packed with magnesium (important for healthy bones and nervous system). They also contain iron (which helps protect against fatigue) and calcium (important for bone health) Plant-based milk alternatives are vegan and arguably more eco-friendly than cow's milk and some people may prefer them if they are intolerant to lactose (a sugar found naturally in cow's milk), but almond milk is actually less nutritious than dairy. Semi-skimmed milk has 7g of protein per 200ml glass, versus only 1g in the same amount of almond milk. This Alpro product is also sweetened with added sugar, while the lactose (sugar) in cow's milk is not considered as harmful to teeth. While almond milk is fortified with calcium and vitamin D, it is not the good source of iodine (important for a baby's brain development) that dairy milk is.

However, these claims don't stand up to examination \u2014 the one, inconclusive, study relating to cherimoya fruit pulp and blood glucose was in rabbits more than ten years ago, while the anti-obesity claim seems to stem only from the fact that the fruit is popular among the long-lived (and slim) people of Okinawa Island in Japan. This southern hemisphere fruit, also called the cherimoya, tastes like bubble gum and has been hailed as protecting against diabetes and obesity Dietitian Helen Bond says: 'Enjoy this fruit as one of your five-a-day, but I'm not convinced it has specific diabetes preventive or weight-control effects compared with eating a wide variety of fruit and veg.' Cherimoyas are similar in sugar content to bananas, but bananas, especially those that are only just ripe, have a lower glycaemic index, so are less likely to cause a spike in blood sugar levels. Bananas are higher in potassium (for healthy blood pressure) and the stress-managing nutrients vitamin B6 and magnesium.

It has a rich and nutty taste. Many people think that spelt flour, an 'old' grain commonly used until bread wheat replaced it in the 20th century, is more like what our ancestors ate and healthier than normal wholemeal flour. Spelt, an ancient wheat species, can be used as a substitute for wheat flour because it has similar properties. It has a rich and nutty taste In fact, the two grains have very similar vitamin and mineral content, with wholegrain wheat containing more selenium and fibre than wholegrain spelt. Spelt is higher in natural sugars, but lower in protein and gluten \u2014 many take this to mean it's easier to digest than wheat flour, but it's a mistake to think you can tolerate spelt if you can't tolerate wheat. 'Spelt does still contain a substantial amount of gluten and is unsafe for anyone with coeliac disease,' says Helen Bond.

                              "text": "Urgent Food Poisoning Alert for All Dog Owners February 08, 2017 | 6,564 views | 0 \nBy Dr. Becker \nRecently a 3-year-old Pug named Bruce in Overland Park, Kansas discovered a tin of sugar-free Mentos and helped himself. Within a half-hour, Bruce was lethargic. Fortunately, his owner connected the dots between the Mentos and Bruce's rapidly deteriorating condition. \nAfter calling the veterinarian's office, as he picked Bruce up to rush him out to the car, the dog went limp. Once at the vet's office, he had a seizure. The mints Bruce had eaten contained xylitol , a sweetener that is highly toxic to dogs. It's a sugar alcohol extracted from corn and corn fiber, birch, raspberries and plums. \nXylitol is used to sweeten a wide range of products, including sugar-free gum and mints, nicotine gum, chewable vitamins, certain prescription drugs, dental hygiene products and baked goods. \nXylitol can also be purchased in granulated form as a sugar replacement to sweeten beverages, cereals and other foods. \nFortunately for Bruce, the veterinary staff quickly treated him with glucose water and monitored him closely. He survived the initial crisis, but they don't know yet if there has been permanent damage to his liver. The Number of Products Containing Xylitol Is Exploding \nXylitol poisoning in dogs is reaching epidemic proportions according to some sources. The sweetener is being used in an ever growing list of products because it's as sweet as sucrose, but with only two-thirds the calories of sugar. \nIt's less expensive than other sugar substitutes, tastes better and causes little if any insulin release in humans. \nJust a few years ago, xylitol could be found in less than a hundred products in the U.S., primarily limited to sugar-free gums, candy and foods. Today it can be found in a wide range of health and beauty products, food products, over-the-counter drugs and supplements and prescription medications. \nUntil fairly recently, xylitol was found primarily in products not normally given to dogs. Poisonings were usually the result of dogs like Bruce sampling human foods, candy or gum on the sly. \nHowever, xylitol is now being found in certain peanut and nut butters. As most dog guardians know, our pets love these creamy butters. Many people use a dab of peanut or nut butter to hide pills or supplements they give to their dog, or they fill a Kong with the gooey stuff as a special treat. Peanut and Nut Butters Containing Xylitol \nDr. Jason Nicholas, who runs Preventive Vet , has compiled a list of nut butters containing xylitol: 1 \n\u2713 Go Nuts, Co. \nAlmond Butter - Chocolate Almond Butter \nPeanut Butter - Dark Chocolate Mint \nPeanut Butter - Natural Chocolate Flavor \nPeanut Butter - Natural Flavor \nPeanut Butter - Organic Maple Flavor \n\u2713 Krush Nutrition \nNutty By Nature Peanut Butter Brownie Batter \nNutty By Nature Peanut Butter Cookie Dough \nNutty By Nature Peanut Butter Snickerdoodle Cookie \nNutty By Nature Peanut Butter Thick & Creamy \n\u2713 Nuts 'N More\u00ae \nHigh Protein + Almond Spread - Almond Butter \nHigh Protein + Almond Spread - Chocolate Almond \nHigh Protein + Almond Spread - Cinnamon Raisin \nHigh Protein + Peanut Spread - Chocolate Peanut \nHigh Protein + Peanut Spread - Peanut Butter Flavor \nHigh Protein + Peanut Spread - Pumpkin Spice \nHigh Protein + Peanut Spread - Toffee Crunch \nPeanut & Protein Spread - Sesame Cranbutter \nPeanut Spread - Peanut Butter Flavor \nPeanut Spread - Toffee Crunch \nHigh Protein Spread - Almond Butter \nHigh Protein Spread - Banana Raisin \nHigh Protein Spread - Peanut Spread \nHigh Protein Spread - Signature Blend \n\u2713 Protein Plus PB \nHank's Protein Plus - Almond Butter \nHank's Protein Plus - Banana \nHank's Protein Plus - Caramel Pretzel \nHank's Protein Plus - Chocolate Chip \nHank's Protein Plus - Coconut \nHank's Protein Plus - Honey Maple \nHank's Protein Plus - Plain \nHank's Protein Plus - Snickerdoodle \nThese are specialty nut butters sold primarily in nutrition stores and online, but the fact that xylitol is now being used in these products is a heads-up for dog parents everywhere of the importance of reading ingredient labels. It's probably just a matter of time before more mainstream peanut and nut butters also contain xylitol. As Dr. Ahna Brutlag, associate director of veterinary services for Pet Poison Helpline explains the seriousness of the situation: \n\"First, dogs fed straight peanut butter as a treat or fed treats baked with xylitol-containing peanut butter may certainly be at risk for harm. \nSecond, a dog that nabs the entire jar of xylitol-containing peanut butter and happily gorges on his or her treasure without anyone knowing could quickly become extremely ill. If this occurred during the day while the owners were not home, it's possible the dog could die before people returned.\" 2 \nYou should be aware of any product in your home containing xylitol, and especially anything you might consider offering to your dog. Xylitol-Related Dog Poisonings More Than Doubled in 7 Years \nEach year as the number of products containing xylitol expands, sadly, so do the cases of poisoning in dogs. In 2007, the first year the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (ASPCA-APCC) started tracking cases of xylitol toxicity in dogs, the Center received 1,764 calls. In 2014, they handled 3,727 xylitol calls. 3 \nThat's over a 200 percent increase in just 7 years, and includes only the cases called into the ASPCA-APCC. There are other animal poison control centers that receive calls, as well as unreported cases of xylitol-related illnesses and deaths. The Toxicity of Xylitol Depends on the Species and Dose \nAlthough xylitol is safe for humans, the sweetener's effect varies by species. In people, rhesus monkeys, rats and horses, xylitol causes little to no insulin release. However, it has the oppositeeffect on dogs, ferrets , rabbits, cows, goats and baboons. Its effect on cats is unknown. \nHumans absorb xylitol slowly, and the sweetener when ingested orally is absorbed at from 50 to 95 percent. However, in dogs, xylitol is rapidly and fully absorbed within about 30 minutes. Just a small amount of xylitol can cause a dangerous insulin surge and a rapid drop in blood sugar. \nThe toxicity of xylitol in dogs is dose-dependent. The dose required to trigger hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) is approximately 0.1 grams/kg, while the amount needed to cause liver failure is about 0.5 grams/kg. Most gum and breath mints typically contain .22 to 1.0 gram of xylitol per piece of gum or mint. \nThis means just a single piece of gum or one mint may cause hypoglycemia in a 10-pound dog. For more detailed information and graphics on how much xylitol is dangerous to different sized dogs, as well as a comparison of xylitol versus chocolate toxicity in dogs, take a look at this Preventive Vet page. Determining the Amount of Xylitol in a Product \nCurrently, product manufacturers aren't required to list the quantity of xylitol on package labels, and while some companies will reveal the amount in their products, many are reluctant to do so. \nIn some cases, you might be able to use the placement of xylitol on an ingredient list to estimate how much is in the product. In the U.S., ingredient lists for foods must be organized in descending order based on weight. The ingredient weighing the most is at the top of the list. \nIn most chewing gum ingredient lists, xylitol appears in fourth or fifth place, making it clinically insignificant. But if it appears as one of the first three ingredients, extreme caution should be taken. In fact, I recommend dog guardians avoid or very carefully secure any product that contains any amount of xylitol, no matter how small. \nWhen it comes to medications and dietary supplements, U.S. regulations do not require manufacturers to list xylitol by name on package labels. This is because the sweetener is often categorized as an \"inactive\" or \"other\" ingredient, and such ingredients don't have to be listed in order by the amount contained in the product. \nTo confuse matters further, when xylitol is named in these products, it is often part of an alphabetized list, which could lead pet owners to assume \u2014 perhaps in error \u2014 that there is a very small amount in the product. That's why it's best, in my opinion, to either avoid or very carefully store any product that contains xylitol in any amount. Dr. Nicholas has compiled a fairly comprehensive list of products containing xylitol here . Symptoms of Xylitol Poisoning and Required Treatment \nSymptoms of xylitol intoxication in dogs include vomiting, weakness, lethargy, loss of coordination, seizures and collapse. Hypoglycemia is usually evident within an hour or two after a dog ingests xylitol, but symptoms are occasionally delayed for several hours. \nTreatment depends on how quickly it is given. Vomiting is induced in cases where the xylitol has just been ingested. Once a dog develops hypoglycemia, IV dextrose must be administered until the animal can self-regulate his blood glucose concentrations, which typically takes from 12 to 48 hours. \nIn dogs who ingest enough xylitol to cause liver toxicity, liver enzymes must be closely monitored, as evidence of hepatic necrosis can show up one to two days after ingestion. Should the liver begin to fail, the dog will require IV fluids, dextrose, hepatoprotectants (substances to help support and repair the liver), and regular monitoring of blood clotting activity. \nWhen xylitol exposure is caught early in a dog and treated effectively, the prognosis for a full recovery is excellent. The prognosis for dogs that develop hepatic failure is less optimistic. 0",

                              "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room 6:10 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. A lot of tremendous things are happening. The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide. Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing. The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what\u2019s going on. And they\u2019re going down; they\u2019re going in the right direction. Cases in the Boston area are now declining. The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific. And Detroit is past its peak. These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen. It\u2019s very exciting. It was very exciting, even today, watching and seeing what\u2019s happening. And people are getting ready and they\u2019re all excited. I do want to mention a man who\u2019s done a very good job for us: Dr. Robert Redfield. He was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus. Totally misquoted. I spoke to him. He said it was ridiculous. He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time. And corona could be just some little flare-ups that we\u2019ll take care of. We\u2019re going to knock it out. We\u2019ll knock it out fast. But that\u2019s what he was referring to: coming together at the same time. And I think rather than waiting, I\u2019d ask Dr. Redfield to come up, say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn\u2019t say it was a big \u2014 a big explosion. The headline in the Washington Post was totally inaccurate. The statement wasn\u2019t bad in the Post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is \u2014 as I say, that\u2019s fake news. And CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew. They were asked to change it, and they wouldn\u2019t do that. And it was false. So I\u2019ll ask Dr. Redfield, who is, you know, a real professional, to come up and explain. Please. Thank you, Doctor. DR. REDFIELD: Thank you, Mr. President. I really do think it\u2019s important to clarify this as we build the confidence of the American people. When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of the fall, winter \u2014 next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time: influenza and the coronavirus-19. But I think it\u2019s really important to emphasize what I didn\u2019t say. I didn\u2019t say that this was going to be worse. I said it was going to be more complic- \u2014 or more difficult and potentially complicated because we\u2019ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time. I want to emphasize that we continue to build the nation\u2019s public health infrastructure to ensure that we have the capacity to sustain the containment mode. Those of you who heard me talk before, I\u2019ve told you that in January and February \u2014 up to February 27, 28, this nation had 14 cases. We were in the containment mode. And then, unfortunately, the virus overwhelmed where we got into this extreme mitigation. We are building that public health capacity now to make sure that we stay in the containment mode for the upcoming fall and winter season so we will not need to resort to the kind of mitigation that we had to this spring. I have confidence that our public health response of early case recognition that we\u2019ve talked about, isolation, and contact tracing, combined with our plans for increased surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable, will be an effective public health strategy so our nation will be able to maintain itself in the containment mode. Again, that will be supported by the American public\u2019s continued cooperation, obviously in the areas of personal hygiene and the types of social distancing strategies that may be appropriate. The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence. One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall-winter season that we\u2019re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact of flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront. Thank you very much. Q Could I just ask a follow-up on that, Dr. Redfield? Q Sir, just to clarify your comments \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: But I don\u2019t know what\u2019s to follow up. Q Well \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: He was misquoted. Totally misquoted. He said they could come together. They didn\u2019t talk about that. And his whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot, so that next fall we don\u2019t have such a big season of flu \u2014 and we possibly won\u2019t. But, as you said, there\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s possible, if the corona even comes back \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to and neither do I. We spoke a great length. And I think the doctor will speak, if you\u2019d like to continue. But we may have some embers \u2014 and we\u2019re going to put them out \u2014 of corona. But we may have a big flu season. But that\u2019s different. Flu is very different from corona. Q Can I just ask him a follow-up question? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, go ahead. Sure. Q Okay. So, Dr. Redfield, the Washington Post \u2014 which, you did the interview with them \u2014 they quoted you as saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be much \u2014 even more difficult than the one we just went through. And when I\u2019ve said this to others, they\u2019ve kind of put their head back, they don\u2019t understand what I mean. We\u2019re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.\u201d Is that what you said to the Washington Post? DR. REDFIELD: Yeah, that\u2019s what I was trying to say to you just a minute ago \u2014 that the issue that I was talking about, about being more difficult, is that we\u2019re going to have two viruses circulating the same time. This spring that we just went through \u2014 February \u2014 we had a benefit of having the flu season ended, so we could use all our flu surveillance systems to say, \u201cWhoops, this is coronavirus. We need to focus.\u201d Next fall and winter, we\u2019re going to have two viruses circulating, and we\u2019re going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus. And so the comment that I made: It\u2019s more difficult. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be more impossible. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be more, as some people have said, \u201cworse.\u201d It just means it\u2019s going to be difficult because we have to distinguish between the two. And what I was wanting to do and what I want to do again here is appeal to the American public to recognize they can really help, like they did with mitigation, which they really helped. I need them to help now to best prepare us by getting the flu vaccine and taking flu out of the picture. Q But that quote \u2014 but that quote \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And you may not even have corona coming back, just so you understand. Doctor, would you like to explain that. Q No, but \u2014 but, I\u2019m sorry, but that quote that I just read was accurate \u2014 right, sir? Because that\u2019s the quote from the Washington Post. You were accurately quoted, correct? DR. REDFIELD: I\u2019m accurately quoted in the Washington Post as \u201cdifficult.\u201d But the headline was inappropriate. THE PRESIDENT: What does the headline say? What does the headline say? Go ahead, read the headline. Q The headline says, \u201cCDC Director Warns Second Wave of Coronavirus is Likely to be Even More Devastating.\u201d And isn\u2019t that correct? Because \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s not what he says. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not what he said. THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not what he said. Q But if you have the two things happening \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: The headline doesn\u2019t correspond to the story. DR. REDFIELD: No. I actually think it\u2019s actually going to be \u2014 I think the American public is going to heed the request to relook at their vaccine hesitancy, to vaccine with confidence for flu. And I\u2019m confident that the public health infrastructure that we\u2019re putting together now across this country so that we can early-case diagnose, isolate, and contact trace \u2014 as I say, block and tackle, block and tackle \u2014 that system is going to be there, and we\u2019re going to be able to contain this virus. Q Why did you retweet the article if it was inaccurate? Doctor, why did you retweet it? THE PRESIDENT: You weren\u2019t called. DR. BIRX: So, I just \u2014 we talked about this yesterday when you asked me this question. And someone, I think, used the word \u201cdevastating.\u201d And I want to really, again, emphasize to the American public that when we first interacted with this virus for the first time in the February and March timeframe, we didn\u2019t have an understanding of its transmissibility, all of its symptoms. We do now. And I think what we are building together, and the \u2014 when we talk about the public health infrastructure, it is very much working on the surveillance piece. But I think we also know the strength of the American people and their ability to immediately understand how to protect themselves with not touching their face, making sure that they\u2019re washing their hands. But the other piece I wanted just to talk about, and we mentioned yesterday also: that we have the summer \u2014 while we have flu surveillance that we can utilize and syndromic management that we can utilize \u2014 we have all of that time to prepare clearly the testing algorithm that you would need in a flu, potentially, if COVID came back. Potentially. And so we are preparing for that potential right now. And I think we spoke to you all about that and talked about how we\u2019re not only preparing for today and tomorrow, but we\u2019re preparing for six months from now, three months from now, and making sure that all of these pieces are in place. I think what Dr. Redfield clearly was asking for \u2014 just like we asked for every American to follow the guidelines, he\u2019s saying: Please add to that guidelines getting your flu shot and making sure you\u2019re protected. THE PRESIDENT: And, Doctor, wouldn\u2019t you say there\u2019s a good chance that COVID will not come back? DR. BIRX: We don\u2019t know \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And if it does comes back, it\u2019s in a very small, confined area that we put out. Go ahead. DR. BIRX: Well, the great thing is we\u2019ll be able to find it earlier this time. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ll find those cases earlier. So what Dr. Redfield said: We would be able to stay in containment phase. And what we\u2019re also hoping \u2014 and we talked about this about four or five weeks ago \u2014 that we\u2019re hoping that the flu infections also go down because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves. We want you to get your vaccine, but we also want to also protect individuals from getting the flu because of the vulnerability, we know, in certain populations to flu and the devastating outcomes to flu. We could prevent and decrease both of those things. So I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if, potentially, the virus comes back. THE PRESIDENT: And if it comes back, though, it won\u2019t be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. But what the doctor was saying \u2014 and I spoke to him a great length \u2014 he was saying, if it should come back \u201ctogether.\u201d Now you have a flu and you have the embers of corona. But, in my opinion, from everything I\u2019ve seen, it can never be like anything that we\u2019ve witnessed right now. Would you say that\u2019s a correct statement? DR. REDFIELD: Absolutely. I think \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s nothing like what we\u2019re talking \u2014 what we\u2019ve just gone though, we will not go through. You could have some embers of corona, and you could have a big flu system. And if they combine, if they come together \u2014 if they come together, it\u2019s not great. But we will not go through what we went through for the last two months. Yeah, Jeff. Q Mr. President, I \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Is that a correct statement? DR. REDFIELD: Correct. Q I understand that the United States will certainly be more prepared in the fall, but how can you say that you know it won\u2019t come back in the same level that it has today? THE PRESIDENT: What \u2014 it is estimated it might not come back at all, Jeff. It may not come back at all. Q But how \u2014 how can you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s talking about a worst-case scenario where you have a big flu and you have some corona. And if it does come back, it\u2019s not going to come back \u2014 and I\u2019ve spoken to 10 different people \u2014 it\u2019s not going to be like it was. Also, we have much better containment now. Before, nobody knew about it. Nobody knew anything about it. We understand it. Now, if we have pockets \u2014 a little pocket here or there \u2014 we\u2019re going to have to put out. It goes out and it\u2019s going to go out fast. We\u2019re going to be watching for it. But it\u2019s all possible. It\u2019s also possible it doesn\u2019t come back at all. Q I understand the containment, but I don\u2019t understand how you know it won\u2019t come back on a big scale. THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s not. I said if it does, it\u2019s not going to come back on anything near what we went through. But you could have a mess, where they come at the same time. And if they come at the same time \u2014 the flu is not the greatest thing in the world, Jeff. It\u2019s not the greatest thing either. If they come at the same time, you have them both. But if we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that\u2019s not going to be pleasant, but it\u2019s not going to be what we\u2019ve gone through in any way, shape, or form. Yeah. Q If you don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to come back at the same severity it is right now, why are you still directing that taxpayer dollars be spent on emergency procurement of ventilators? Tens of thousands of \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Because we have to have them for other reasons. Something else could come. I mean, we didn\u2019t know about corona; now we know about corona. But look at what happened. And now, we did have the H1N1 swine flu. We had that. We have other things that have happened. We had various forms of flu, but nothing like what we\u2019ve had here. Nothing at all like what we\u2019ve had here with the virus. But something could happen. I think that the stockpiles \u2014 we\u2019re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators right now. Nobody writes about that. You know, at the one time, all they talked about was ventilators, right? Because you didn\u2019t think it was possible for me to solve that problem. And I solved it and nobody can believe it. I just spoke to world leaders today who desperately need ventilators. They said, \u201cThe job you\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d And we\u2019re sending 500 to Mexico, then another 500 to France. We\u2019re sending some to Spain. We\u2019re sending some to Italy. We have them \u2014 they\u2019re being made by the thousands. And world leaders \u2014 I spoke to Prime Minister \u2014 I mean, I went through a lot of different calls today. I won\u2019t even tell you. But I went through \u2014 I can give you a list if you want \u2014 but I went through a lot of calls to a lot of leaders. Spoke with Pakistan; they would like to have some ventilators. We\u2019re going to get them some ventilators. But they all said to me one thing: It was incredible that you solved the ventilator problem because that was a big problem. The testing problem. We\u2019ve done more than any other nation in the world. Go a step further: If you added up the testing of every nation in the world, put them together, we\u2019ve done substantially more than that. You people aren\u2019t satisfied. So let\u2019s say we had 350 million people in the United States, right? Let\u2019s say. And if we gave every one of those people a test 10 times \u2014 so we give 350 people a test 10 times \u2014 the fake news media would say, \u201cWhere\u2019s the 11th time? He didn\u2019t do his job. Trump didn\u2019t do his job.\u201d Because you have a lot of bad reporting out there. It\u2019s very sad. And it\u2019s so bad \u2014 Q But that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s not true. That wouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: But you\u2019re one of \u2014 you\u2019re one of the leaders of the bad reporting. You know? Q No, but that\u2019s not true. I mean, this is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Okay, let\u2019s get onto another subject. I wanted that to be \u2014 Q Mr. President, can I just follow up on this real quick? THE PRESIDENT: I wanted that to be cleared up. If you want, we can get on to it later, but I want the Vice President to speak. But you ought to get the news accurately. You ought to write it \u2014 if you \u2014 if you take a look at what you wrote about the ventilators \u2014 and when we became the king of ventilators \u2014 we\u2019re making different factories all over. Ventilators by the thousands. In fact, Mike got back from Wisconsin. The first thing he did, he called up. I said, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe.\u201d He just saw a plant, a factory where they\u2019re making ventilators. I think I can say, the words were \u201cunbelievable.\u201d He said it was unbelievable what he saw \u2014 the quality of the equipment, the professionalism. THE VICE PRESIDENT: They doubled production. THE PRESIDENT: A tremendous number of \u2014 how many workers would you say were there? THE VICE PRESIDENT: It was over 550. They doubled production and are about to triple production. THE PRESIDENT: Nobody thought this could be done. The fake news was very unhappy that it was done. But you guys don\u2019t ask me about ventilators anymore. Q Well, who\u2019s unhappy \u2014 who\u2019s unhappy that ventilators are being made, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: Everybody. Everybody. Because you never mention it. You never mention it. There\u2019s no story that\u2019s what a great job we\u2019ve done with ventilators. We\u2019re now supplying ventilators all over the world. Because no other country could have done what we did. And you should say that\u2019s a great story. Instead you say, \u201cTrump was slow\u201d or \u2014 slow? We were so fast. Plus, we put the ban on so much earlier. When Nancy Pelosi, as an example \u2014 you don\u2019t say this \u2014 when she\u2019s having her rally in San Francisco \u2014 in Chinatown, in San Francisco. Nobody wants to say that. If we didn\u2019t \u2014 and Dr. Fauci said this \u2014 if we didn\u2019t close our country to China, we would have been so infected, like nobody\u2019s ever seen. When you saw the chart \u2014 and we were at the top of the list, in terms of success \u2014 nobody wrote it. I said, \u201cWhere \u2014 is anybody going to use that chart?\u201d Nobody wrote it. In terms of mortality. You saw that. Nobody wrote it. Germany and our country: the most successful, in terms of mortality. Nobody wrote it. It would be great if you wrote the truth, but let\u2019s get on with it because I want Mike to speak. And then we\u2019ll take some more questions, on the assumption you\u2019d like to and I think you probably will. It\u2019s been encouraging to watch states begin to open up as \u2014 and it really has been; it\u2019s a beautiful thing to see \u2014 as restrictions are lifted. We must maintain vigilance and continue practicing social distancing. I encourage governors to follow a careful, phased approach. And I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines. Very important. The governors are going to adhere, hopefully, or they\u2019re going to do what they think is best. I want them to do what they think is best, but ideally they\u2019ll adhere. Wash your hands, avoid close physical contact as much as possible, and wear a face covering when distancing is impractical. There were cases. We\u2019ve flattened the curve and really made tremendous progress, but we must guard against a dangerous rebound. We don\u2019t want to rebound. That\u2019s so important. This is what we were just talking about. We don\u2019t want a rebound. The doctor doesn\u2019t want to rebound. These people definitely don\u2019t want to rebound. I don\u2019t think you want one, do you, huh? You especially. We don\u2019t want to rebounds after all this death \u2014 death \u2014 that we\u2019ve suffered. Not work \u2014 I don\u2019t view it \u201cwork\u201d; I view it \u201cdeath\u201d that was unnecessary. It should have never happened. It should have never left that little area where it started. You know it and I know it and they know it. In our all-out war against the virus, we continue to make great strides on testing. Famous testing. Doing more than anybody else anywhere in the world. Nothing funny about that, Jon. Most of the governors have never faced a situation like this before, but we\u2019re helping them find unused testing capacity within their states \u2014 tremendous testing capacity that the governors, in many cases, didn\u2019t know they had. And additional capabilities are coming on line every day. We\u2019re coming up with new equipment, like the Abbott Laboratories equipment \u2014 on site, five minutes. Great success. Everybody wants it. But you can only make so many of those machines, so we have many other forms of testing. We have many other machines that do it very quickly and by the millions \u2014 by the millions. Our task force issued its reopening guidelines earlier than April 30th to give governors the time that they needed to develop testing capability and capacity and customized plans for their states, which many of them did. We\u2019ve had some governors do a fantastic job on testing and on a lot of other things. I spoke \u2014 as you know, Governor Cuomo was here. He had a \u2014 we had a great conversation on testing yesterday, and they\u2019re doing a really good job in New York. We\u2019re working very closely with each of the states to help them succeed. I spoke earlier today with Governor Newsom, California. And that was all about testing, that conversation. He has been scaling up really well. Really good job. And I agreed to help him get some of the critical supplies that California needs to make use of the tremendous capacity that they\u2019ve found. This is a tremendous testing capacity. And I\u2019m going to do it very quickly. He needs certain things. I\u2019m going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to get that to him very quickly. Now, could he get it himself? Yes. But I can get it faster. He understands that. And he\u2019s done a great job. And we\u2019re going to have it to him \u2014 we\u2019re going to have a lot of it to him over the next two days. And we\u2019re going to beef it up the following week, get him a lot of additional. He\u2019s done a really terrific job in California. Some of the governors have done a fantastic job, working with us. I told the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia. They\u2019re incredible people. I love those people. They are \u2014 they\u2019re great. They\u2019ve been strong, resolute. But, at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right. I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he\u2019s doing. But I want to let the governors do \u2014 now, if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I\u2019ll do. But I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barbershops in phase one \u2014 we\u2019re going to have phase two very soon \u2014 is just too soon. I think it\u2019s too soon. And I love the people. I love \u2014 I love those people that use all of those things: the spas and the beauty parlors and barbershops, tattoo parlors. I love them. But they can wait a little bit longer. Just a little bit. Not \u2014 not much. Because safety has to predominate. We have to have that. So I told the governor, very simply, that I disagree with his decision, but he has to do what he thinks is right. I\u2019m excited to announce that, in the coming weeks, the Air Force Thunderbirds \u2014 they\u2019re incredible \u2014 and the Navy Blue Angels \u2014 equally incredible \u2014 will be performing air shows over America\u2019s major cities and some of the cities that aren\u2019t major cities. They\u2019re going to be doing a lot of work \u2014 a lot of very dangerous flying. It\u2019s dangerous, you know \u2014 the odds when you start going at massive speeds and you\u2019re 18 inches away from each other. That\u2019s dangerous work. Your son is a great pilot. And I don\u2019t know if he could be \u2014 could he be a \u2014 could he be a Thunderbird? I don\u2019t know. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ll see. THE PRESIDENT: I think \u2014 I think he probably could, from what I hear. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want him to be, because it is \u2014 it\u2019s incredible what they\u2019re able to do. And to sacrifice our frontline \u2014 what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re paying tribute to our frontline healthcare workers confronting COVID. And it\u2019s really a signal to all Americans to remain vigilant during the outbreak. This is a \u2014 a tribute to them, to our warriors. Because they are equal warriors to those incredible pilots and all of the fighters that we have for the more traditional fights that we win. And we win. If we want to win, we always win. Sometimes we don\u2019t want to win, so we just go to a standstill. But that\u2019s always \u2014 that\u2019s not the way this country works. Operation America Strong was the idea of our great military men and women \u2014 the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels crews who wanted to show support to the American medical workers who, just like military members in a time of war, are fiercely running torward the fight. It\u2019s going to be great. I want to see those shows. I\u2019ve seen them many times and I can\u2019t get enough of them. And on July 4th, we\u2019ll be doing what we had at the Mall, as you know. We\u2019re going to be doing it. Last year was a tremendous success and I would imagine we\u2019ll do it \u2014 hopefully, I can use the term \u201cforever.\u201d That was a great success as you remember, even though it was pouring. It was raining so hard. It was raining at \u2014 that was about as hard as I\u2019ve seen in a while, but it was an amazing success. Didn\u2019t bother the pilots. It didn\u2019t bother the military. It didn\u2019t bother the crews that we had there. So we\u2019re going to be doing that again on July 4th. Our great military is operating at 100 percent during this crisis and thousands of troops are deployed alongside of civilians in the COVID hotspots, as you know. You see them all over. I spoke \u2014 when I spoke with Governor Cuomo, and when I spoke to Gavin Newsom, and many of the other governors, they wanted to know if we could have some military help with the medical, and we \u2014 we gave it to them. And in every case, they said, \u201cFantastic.\u201d I mean, just fantastic. In New York City, Mayor de Blasio called me to say it was inspiring to watch. He was there when the military came in. He said it gave everybody spirit when he saw the professionalism and the spirit that they had. They walked in and they helped a lot of \u2014 a lot of people: doctors, nurses, respiratory technicians, and professionals. It was an incredible thing. But they all \u2014 everybody that saw them going to work said that was something special. So we\u2019re going to have some tremendous air shows all throughout our country. And that\u2019s in honor of what we\u2019re all going through together, and the people that are helping us so much, and, unfortunately, the people who have passed away from something that should never have been allowed to happen. Following around-the-clock negotiations yesterday, the Senate answered my call to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program so that millions of additional American workers can keep getting a paycheck. We just increased it by $310 billion dollars. I urged the House to pass the bill without delay. In our first round of funding, we\u2019ve provided nearly $350 billion dollars, and it went at record speed to American workers and small businesses. And it\u2019s really been an incredible, incredible success. I want to thank the banks. We have the big banks, the little banks, the commercial banks of all kinds. We had the community banks \u2014 who were fantastic, by the way. Community banks. And as you know \u2014 this was an interesting story in recent days \u2014 I\u2019ve called for Harvard \u2014 that\u2019s Harvard University, which has a $40 billion endowment fund \u2014 to return the money that it was allocated under the CARES Act. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds, nor will Stanford University or many of the others that were involved both on a university level. Also on company level, some of the companies were bigger than people had represented or bigger than people had thought and strong enough that they didn\u2019t need the money. So there\u2019s a certain amount of money that we are not sending. As soon as I heard it, I said, \u201cStop funds.\u201d And for the most part, I guess, they stopped it, Mike, right? They stopped it. But we\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not accepting the money, and that\u2019s great. And so I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford, and I want to thank the other companies in the case. It\u2019s broken differently between colleges and companies, but I want to thank the companies and the other great universities. And there\u2019s some great ones. The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday also reserves $30 billion in loans for small financial institutions that serve minority and distressed communities. This is very important. We\u2019re determined to protect our African American, Hispanic American, and minority workers who have been hit so hard by this hidden enemy. My administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to address the full spectrum of needs in these communities, supporting both health and economic revitalization. First, my administration is committed to providing the testing that is needed to fight the virus in distressed communities. In the last month alone, we\u2019ve already sent over $1.4 billion to our nation\u2019s 13,000 community healthcare centers \u2014 think of that, 13,000 \u2014 to increase testing and treatment in the underserved areas. We\u2019re also expanding access to telehealth. Telehealth has become a big deal. You know, I\u2019ve been reading about it for years, and all of a sudden, because of this, it\u2019s become a big \u2014 a big thing. People can\u2019t leave their houses. They didn\u2019t want to leave their houses for various reasons, including they wanted to follow the guidelines. The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday \u2014 and I want to thank everybody. A great, great vote. Great. It\u2019s \u2014 as you know, it was a unanimous vote. How often do you see that? But the legislation passed by the Senate yesterday includes an additional $25 billion to further expand testing, and provides even more funding for community health centers and various forms of epidemics and pandemics. And we\u2019ll be working on that because, you know, as per a couple of your statements and questions before, we want to work on that for the future. We hope this doesn\u2019t happen again for \u2014 again, ever. But, you know, last time it was of this magnitude: 1917. That\u2019s a long time ago. So we want to be prepared. And we are prepared. And, as I told you, we\u2019re building up hospital \u2014 not only our stockpile, which is being up greatly \u2014 being built up greatly \u2014 but also hospital stockpiles. We\u2019re getting them what they need. We\u2019re working out cost arrangements with them. And we\u2019re getting them a lot of the ventilators, which are the hardest thing for them to get, both from a cost standpoint and a technical standpoint. At the same time, we\u2019re also supporting the establishment of new testing sites focused on these communities. Forty sites have launched so far, and there are plans to launch dozens more in the next three weeks. We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re coming up with testing apparatus and testing plans that are incredible when you look at the numbers. And some people are very, very big on testing. I\u2019m big on testing, but some people are much less big than I am, I will tell you, and they\u2019re professionals. But we want to have it so that nobody can talk about, \u201cGee whiz, I wish we had more testing.\u201d Nobody has done it like we\u2019ve done it, and nobody will. And we\u2019re getting very much stronger. We have incredible professionals doing it. So many different tests have now evolved, people are finding it even hard to believe. My administration is working closely with governors to ensure that they have the testing infrastructure in place to reduce further spread of the virus if they\u2019re so inclined to use the testing apparatus, including strategies for older individuals, low-income Americans, minorities, and Native Americans. As part of the effort, the White House Task Force, headed up by Mike, who has done incredible \u2014 I\u2019ll say it every time. I\u2019ll say it to anybody that wants to listen: Mike Pence has done an incredible job. Really, an incredible job. Thank you. Is providing technical assistance to all 50 states through one-on-one phone calls as they develop and implement their plans. In addition, my administration is committed to restoring black and Hispanic communities to full economic health. They want to be healthy, economically and physically, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. To that end, today I\u2019m directing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, led by Secretary Ben Carson, to focus its effort on supporting underserved communities impacted by the coronavirus. And so Ben Carson is working on that with Mike and myself and a lot of other people. I\u2019m going to ask Tim Scott, who was so helpful with the Opportunity Zones. That\u2019s an economic answer to a lot of problems. And Tim Scott was fantastic, and so I\u2019m going to ask him to get involved with you. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be willing to do it from South Carolina. I also asked the council to identify what additional funding will be required from Congress beyond what has already been provided. We\u2019re really building ourself a strong base and we\u2019re building ourself a wall that\u2019s very different from the kind of walls that you\u2019ve been hearing me talking about. But it nevertheless, in many ways, performs the same function. And hopefully it\u2019s going to perform it equally as well. Furthermore, the council will seek input from the private sector and community leaders on how we can best support minority and distressed communities. As President, I\u2019m absolutely determined to deliver a great future for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Before our nation was attacked by this horrible enemy, our African American and Hispanic American citizens were prospering like never before. Best employment numbers ever. Not only African American, Asian American, Hispanic American \u2014 every American. We were breaking records at every level. We had almost 160 million people employed. We were never even close to that number. And we\u2019re also breaking them economically \u2014 highest stock market numbers, highest numbers of every kind. And I think we\u2019re going to be back there, and I think it\u2019s going to be much sooner rather than later. And I think we\u2019ll surpass those numbers, including our employment numbers. But I\u2019ll not rest until that prosperity has been fully restored. And, again, I really believe that we\u2019re going to lift those numbers higher than ever before. And it won\u2019t be as long as people might think. A lot of very smart people are looking at that and they\u2019re betting. You just have to look at what\u2019s going on with the stock market. In order to protect our great American workers, I\u2019ve just signed an executive order temporarily suspending immigration into the United States. This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens. Crucially, it will also preserve our healthcare resources for American patients. We have to take care of our patients, we have to take care of our great American workers, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So I\u2019ve just signed it, just before coming into the room. And very important, very important. And as to amending it or extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time. But it\u2019s now signed. Earlier today, the First Lady and I planted a tree on the South Lawn of the White House in recognition of the 50th annual Earth Day. I was glad to announce that we will begin to reopen our national parks and public lands. We want Americans to be able to satisfy and be really safe. We want them to satisfy their family that safety is going to happen. And it will happen, and maybe even at a level like never before. We\u2019ve learned so much. But we want them to enjoy these great national treasures as we continue to take reasonable precautions. And hopefully, it\u2019ll be just reasonable. My administration has directed more than $7 billion in federal funding to support the development of treatments, diagnostics, and therapies. And that\u2019s something, Doctors, I hope you can really work on. It\u2019s something so powerful and so important. The FDA, the NIH, and industry leaders are establishing master clinical trial protocols to test multiple promising new drugs at the same time. And they\u2019re doing a lot of \u2014 we\u2019re doing a lot of testing right now. More than 1,600 locations across the country have signed up to administer convalescent plasma to patients, infusing them with antibodies of those who have recovered. And when they recover \u2014 I said it last time \u2014 practically, the first thing they say is, \u201cI want to give my blood so that I can help other people.\u201d They want to give their blood. It\u2019s incredible. They\u2019re laying in bed, they\u2019re still in pretty weakened conditions, and they say, \u201cI want to give my blood.\u201d And that\u2019s happening all the time, isn\u2019t it? If you recovered from the coronavirus, I ask you to consider contacting your local blood or plasma donation center to arrange a donation that could potentially save many lives. With love for our nation and loyalty for our fellow citizens, we will safeguard our families, care for our neighbors, heal the sick, protect our workers, and build a future for a country that is the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we\u2019re only going to get greater. Thank you very much. Mike Pence, please. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today and, despite the fact that there have been more than 843,000 Americans who contracted the coronavirus and we grieve the loss of more than 47,000 of our countrymen, according to Dr. Birx and her team, we continue to see encouraging signs because the American people have been putting into practice the guidance that\u2019s been issued by the President and this task force and they\u2019ve been taking to heart the guidance of state and local officials. And, Mr. President, as we learned today, we are continuing to see declines in all the major metro areas around the country that have been most impacted. Numbers remain low and steady on the West Coast \u2014 in Washington State and in California. The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut all appear to be past their peak. And as \u2014 as our scientists may reflect in a few moments, we also are seeing the positive rate going down, which is actually even as encouraging as the declining cases. The Detroit metro area appears to be past its peak. The Seattle metro area, as I mentioned, remain stable. The New Orleans metro area is the most stable of all the large metro outbreaks. We also are continuing to see a stabilization and even declines in \u2014 in Houston and Atlanta and Nashville and Baltimore and Indianapolis and elsewhere. This is a tribute to the American people, to the fact that the American people have taken to heart the guidelines \u2014 the social distancing; the personal hygiene; the recommendation that you use the drive-through at a restaurant, rather than going in a restaurant; and avoiding groups of more than 10. On the President\u2019s behalf, on behalf of our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, we just want to urge all of the American people to continue onward. We all want to reopen America. And we want to reopen our states and our communities as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so. But I want to say to my countrymen: the fastest way to reopen America is to continue to do what you\u2019ve been doing. That\u2019s the fastest way, as President Trump has said many times, to get our country working again \u2014 is to put the coronavirus in the past. And we are on our way to doing just that. You know, from early on, the President called forth not only the full power of the federal government, but he called forth the full weight of the American economy. And I had the privilege yesterday to travel to Madison, Wisconsin, and see American industry and American workers at their very best. And I want to thank the GE Healthcare team in Wisconsin, as well as the union machinists that I spent time with all day yesterday. It was extraordinary, Mr. President. And earlier this month, you used the Defense Production Act to ensure that supplies could flow to GE and General Motors and Ford and other companies that \u2014 that were prepared to repurpose manufacturing lines and hire new workers to construct ventilators. And, at this particular plant, they literally have \u2014 the union sat down \u2014 the machinists\u2019 union sat down and, in less than one week, negotiated a new contract with GE Healthcare that allowed them to begin to bring in workers from around the country. They doubled \u2014 they doubled their \u2014 their work line in one week. They\u2019re about to triple it. They\u2019ve been going 24 hours a day, 3 shifts, 7 days a week. And the President promised that, by harnessing the power of the American economy, we would have 100,000 ventilators in 100 days. But thanks to the ingenuity and the hardworking Americans that I was with yesterday and other companies, we\u2019re actually going to have 110,000 ventilators in 100 days. They were all wearing t-shirts, Mr. President \u2014 I brought one back for you \u2014 that simply read, \u201cUnion Machinists Save Lives.\u201d And to that great team of GE Healthcare, I want to just say all of America is proud of you and grateful for you. We\u2019re also grateful to all of our healthcare workers at every level and all the work that they\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re proud that our National Guard and our American military are at their side. As our task force learned today, more than 31,000 National Guard stood up around the country. And the President, in the last day, extended what\u2019s called Title 32 authorizations for all National Guard personnel through May 31. So we\u2019re going to continue to partner with states, as the National Guard plays a vital role in testing, and in cleaning nursing homes, and in standing up states\u2019 response. Military personnel: Mr. President, we have more than 5,500 active duty military personnel, including, as of yesterday, 964 medical professionals in the uniform of the United States, working in 17 hospitals in 7 states around the country. We\u2019re also very proud of our team at the VA. The VA has \u2014 has addressed its capacity issues. It\u2019s not seeing cases among the veterans in its facilities increase, so they\u2019re deploying teams to focus on nursing homes. In Massachusetts, the VA personnel have disinfected two different nursing homes in New Jersey. They\u2019ve literally taken over two state nursing homes and deployed 90 doctors and nurses. And, in Florida, we\u2019re sending 16 teams to assist in nursing home operations. As the President also mentioned, in addition to what I saw yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to \u2014 we continue to build our Strategic National Stockpile. It\u2019s growing, again, with ventilators \u2014 nearly 11,000 in supply. Nine hundred and one new ventilators will be added, transitioned in the near term. And every American, I think, can \u2014 can be confident that, should the need arise for your family member, facing serious consequences from the coronavirus to need that equipment to help them breathe, that equipment will be there. As we said yesterday in Wisconsin and you\u2019ve said, Mr. President, I think it should be a great source of comfort to every American that no American who has required a ventilator in the United States has been denied a ventilator. And that\u2019s a testament to our healthcare workers, it\u2019s a testament to every American putting mitigation principles into practice, and it\u2019s a testament to all these great companies. Speaking of great companies, American businesses are stepping up. It was on April 1st that I traveled to Walmart distribution center and the President reached out to the \u2014 to the president and CEO of Walmart to ask Walmart to get in the gowns business. And, Mr. President, I\u2019m glad to report to you that we heard today at the task force that Walmart is producing 8.4 million gowns, and they will be delivered into our commercial supply to healthcare facilities around the country by the end of June. They\u2019re hardly alone. Honda is producing 500,000 face shields. New Balance is making 100,000 masks a week. In a very real sense, the American people have stepped up to make the sacrifices and endure the hardship that social distancing has required, but American businesses, at every size and every means, have come together to respond to the President\u2019s call. It really has been a whole-of-America approach. And our message from the President\u2019s White House Coronavirus Task Force is to tell the American people it\u2019s working. We\u2019re getting there. We can see light at the end of the tunnel. We can see the day that we can reopen and put America back to work. But it\u2019s going to take all of us, continuing to make the sacrifices necessary to practice those disciplines, to get us to a place where we can reopen safely and confidently. And with that, Mr. President, I\u2019ll call Dr. Fauci up for his reflections and \u2014 and we\u2019ll move on. THE PRESIDENT: Great. DR. FAUCI: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. So I\u2019m going to just take off from when I was at this podium a few days ago, to kind of reiterate some of the things that the Vice President said, but to kind of connect the dots from where we were, where we are now, and where I think we\u2019re going to be. So, you remember a couple of weeks ago, when we talked about the fact that we were going to have a really bad week because the deaths, particularly driven by the situation in New York, were going to get worse and worse. But yet, as that was happening, we were starting to see some turnaround, some flattening, and some coming down. As you\u2019ve heard from Dr. Birx and will likely hear more, that that is continuing. So what has happened is that the mitigation that we put in with the first 15 days and then the 30-day mitigation program of physical distancing worked. So it got us to where we are today. It is a successful formula. It is the basis for our being able to say that we can now think seriously about reopening America. And for that reason, we put together a carefully thought out and, I believe, well-delineated and described program for Opening Up America Again. And you know what it is; it\u2019s the guidelines that we announced a few days ago. Those very guidelines are based on a version of the successful formula that got us to where we are. So what I\u2019m trying to say is that the program is not one that is going to be: \u201cTurn the lights on in America. We\u2019re finished.\u201d We\u2019re not. We have to proceed in a very careful, measured way. And if you look at the guidelines, they are careful and they are measured. There are certain checkpoints before you can even think about going into a phase one, and then things relax a little as you go into phase two, and relax a little and you go into phase three. Now, we live in a big country and it\u2019s heterogeneous, and there are different dynamics of outbreaks in different parts of the country. So the speed with which one can go from one to another, at the point at which you can even begin to think about the phase, is going to differ. So the one thing that I know: The urge we all have to get out there and get it over with \u2014 let\u2019s get back to normal \u2014 for a lot of good reasons because there\u2019s a lot of suffering, economic and otherwise, in this country because of that. But again, as I\u2019ve pleaded early on, weeks ago, I plead with the American public, with the governors, with the mayors, for the people with responsibility: Although I know one has the need to leapfrog over things, don\u2019t do that. Do it in a measured way. This is a successful formula. The problem is if we don\u2019t do that, there is a likelihood that we\u2019ll have a rebound. And the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we can\u2019t take care of. So, please, again, let me just close by pleading with the American public in general and those who are responsible leaders to carefully consider how we get back to normal. Thank you. Q Dr. Fauci, could you talk a little about your expectations for the fall? We heard from Dr. Redfield and Dr. Birx. What do you see for the fall? Is it going to be embers or possibly no return of the virus at all? DR. FAUCI: You know, as I\u2019ve said before here, when you look at an outbreak, it\u2019s two dynamic forces opposing each other. If you leave the virus to its own devices, it will take off if you do nothing to stop it. If you put into place the kinds of things that we talk about, first, containment \u2014 and then hopefully you never get to mitigation \u2014 but containment is important. Those two forces are going to determine whether you\u2019re going to have a big outbreak. So, what Dr. Redfield was saying, first of all, is that we will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that because of the degree of \u2014 of transmissibility that it has, the global nature. What happens with that will depend on how we\u2019re able to contain it when it occurs. And what we\u2019re saying is that, in the fall, we will be much, much better prepared to do the kind of containment compared to what happened to us this winter. Now, the complicating issue is that, unlike the syndromic and influenza-like observances that we have, that you could pick it up by clinically what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s going to get complicated by influenza season. And I believe that\u2019s what Dr. Redfield was saying, that it is going to be complicated. So whether or not it\u2019s going to be big or small is going to depend on our response. And \u2014 and that\u2019s what I think people sometimes have misunderstanding. Nobody can predict what is going to happen with an outbreak, but you can predict how you\u2019re going to respond to it. And that\u2019s really very important. Q So you would caution against people thinking that, in the fall, there\u2019s not going to be coronavirus anymore and we won\u2019t have to worry about it? DR. FAUCI: No. No. Q Or if it is, it\u2019ll be spotty and it won\u2019t be a big problem we have to worry about? DR. FAUCI: No. There will be coronavirus in the fall. If we do \u2014 which we won\u2019t, but let\u2019s take an imaginary period. We say, \u201cOkay, coronavirus, forget about it. We\u2019re not going to do anything about it.\u201d It will take off. That\u2019s what viruses do, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re going to respond to it to not allow it to do that. Q Dr. Fauci, what happens when governors like Governor Kemp are not following this careful, measured plan and moving forward even without meeting the gating criteria? What do you do about that? DR. FAUCI: Well \u2014 well, you know, if I were advising the governor, I would tell him that he should be careful. And I would advise him not to just turn the switch on and go. Because there is a danger of a rebound. And I know there\u2019s the desire to move ahead quickly \u2014 that\u2019s a natural, human nature desire \u2014 but going ahead and leapfrogging into phases where you should not be, I would advise him, as a health official and as a physician, not to do that. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Go ahead, please. Q Thank you, Mr. President. Can you please give some details about the executive order? I know that the White House has just released a document. I haven\u2019t had a chance to review it. THE PRESIDENT: Well, we could talk about that later. It\u2019s an executive order on immigration. We want Americans to have the jobs. We want Americans to have the healthcare. We want to take care of our citizens first. We have to. And it\u2019s a very powerful order. It\u2019s for 60 days. At the end of 60 days, or maybe even during 60 days, I\u2019ll extend it or not. And I\u2019ll maybe change it. I might modify it. Yes. Q (Inaudible) for immigrants who are already here, Mr. President? Q Mr. President, I wanted to ask you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, go ahead, please. Q Immigrants who are already here in the country or immigrants abroad who already effectively have a green card, trying to get into the country, and healthcare workers? THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re talking about immigrants that are trying to get in, and we\u2019re talking about people and \u2014 also, by the way, people that are coming in illegally. Now, as you know, because you\u2019ve seen the numbers, our border \u2014 our southern border \u2014 is very, very tight. It hasn\u2019t been this tight in years. It\u2019s being helped by 160 \u2014 more than that \u2014 miles of wall that are going up. I\u2019m trying to get to 450 by the end of the year \u2014 450 miles. And we\u2019ll have 530 miles early next year, and that\u2019s really great. It\u2019s fully funded. We have all the funds. And the Army Corps of Engineers is doing a fantastic job. Same people that did Javits Center, as you know. They\u2019re doing a fantastic job. So our \u2014 our southern border is very, very tight, for good reason \u2014 for very good reason. We\u2019re also being helped by 27,000 very good soldiers from Mexico, and I want to thank the President of Mexico. He\u2019s been terrific in many ways, including on what we\u2019re doing with COVID. And, as you know, we have a very good trade arrangement with Mexico now, which we didn\u2019t have before. So I want to thank the President of Mexico, in particular for the 27,000 soldiers. Q Do you want to talk about the exemptions for the healthcare workers, sir? THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re doing \u2014 they\u2019re doing a fantastic job. Q Do you want to talk about the exemptions for healthcare workers? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we want to protect our healthcare workers, and that\u2019s one of the other reasons we\u2019re doing this. Yes, Jon. Q Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about Rick Bright. He\u2019s the head of the federal agency in charge of getting a vaccine out to \u2014 to Americans once it\u2019s ready. He says he has been pushed out of his job because he raised questions about hydroxychloroquine and some of your directives on that. Was he pushed out of that job? THE PRESIDENT: I \u2014 I\u2019ve never heard of him. You just mentioned the name. I never heard of him. When did this happen? Q This happened today. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019ve never heard of him. If the guy says he was pushed out of a job, maybe he was, maybe he wasn\u2019t. I \u2014 you\u2019d have to hear the other side. I don\u2019t know who he is. Please. Q And on the hydroxychloroquine \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Hold on one second, please. Q I just wanted to \u2014 you said by Fourth of July you expect people be on the National Mall and we\u2019ll be having a celebration like we did \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Hope so. Q \u2014 last year. Given what the doctors are just saying \u2014 that, you know, coronavirus is still going to be out there \u2014 might not be as bad as it is now, but it\u2019s still going to be circulating \u2014 is that \u2014 is that going to be safe to have that many people on the Mall for July Fourth? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re going to probably have 25 percent of what we had last year. Last year, as you know, it was maxed out \u2014 maxed out. I saw a magnificent picture of Dr. Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year, and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful. Very similar. This year, most likely, we\u2019ll be standing six feet apart. We\u2019ll have to do that in a very, very interesting way. And maybe we\u2019ll even do it greater, so we\u2019ll leave a little extra distance. But if we do that, we\u2019d certainly do that. I \u2014 I don\u2019t see, maybe, the purpose if we can\u2019t do that. We have to have people. Thousands \u2014 we had tens of thousands \u2014 most of you were there \u2014 tens of thousands of people last year. It was incredible. And it was, to an extent, an air show of all the different aircraft flying over. We even had Air Force One flying over. So ideally, it would be wonderful if we could actually have it as it was last year. But \u2014 and, eventually, we\u2019ll \u2014 we will have that. I think it\u2019s important to know: Eventually, we are going to have that. Your stadiums are going to be the way \u2014 Q You think by July you\u2019d be able to have \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 they\u2019ve been for the last hundred years. Q By July, you\u2019d be able to have a \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, I know. But your stadiums \u2014 as an example, sports \u2014 are going to be the way they used to be. I mean, I told one of the owners. He said, \u201cDo you think I should take out seats?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t take out seats.\u201d We\u2019re going to have it the way it was. We\u2019re going to be back. This virus will eventually be gone. And if it should show up in the fall, we\u2019re going to put it out very fast. We have great people. We\u2019re going to put it out very fast, because we\u2019ve learned a lot. We\u2019ve learned a lot about how to deal with this, and we\u2019ll put it out very fast. Yeah, please. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Nice \u2014 just nice and easy. Just \u2014 good. Q You talk a lot about testing capacity. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q And governors agree that that exists. But it\u2019s very different from testing implementation. And they are still begging for you to use your full authority to help them get reagents and other things. As you would like to say, what do you have to lose by helping them do that \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Well, I am doing that. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We are doing that. Q \u2014 and becoming the king of testing? THE PRESIDENT: And \u2014 and let me just say, we are the king of testing already. There\u2019s no country in the world that\u2019s done more. Not even \u2014 not even close. Q Well, only 1.2 percent of the population has been tested. Is that good enough? THE PRESIDENT: I just said there\u2019s no country in the world that\u2019s done more. And we have tests that have already come out that are going to be introduced very shortly that will do it more. My problem is this: It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s very much of media trap. Whether we did 2 percent, 5 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent, it\u2019ll never be enough, no matter what. Q But it\u2019s 1.2 percent. THE PRESIDENT: Now, with the \u2014 with the expertise and with what we did \u2014 because of our expertise and tremendous talent at manufacturing \u2014 what we did with the ventilators, that wasn\u2019t a trap. Because we got them done, shockingly to everybody, because of the incredible talent \u2014 like Mike Pence saw yesterday in Wisconsin. But we have numerous of those sites all over the country doing the same thing. So that when the governors were complaining \u2014 some of the governors, I must say. And it was very much along party lines, for the most part, but when they \u2014 except for one. When the governors were complaining, we said, \u201cNo, no. How many do you need?\u201d \u201cWe need 50.\u201d \u201cWe need 100.\u201d One governor asked for many, many, many thousands, and it turned out they didn\u2019t need that, and that\u2019s good. We got them and nobody that needed a ventilator \u2014 you know this, and we went through this with the governors \u2014 that needed a ventilator didn\u2019t get a ventilator. That was an incredible achievement. With testing, it\u2019s a little different. It\u2019s much easier than ventilators. It\u2019s like 2 percent. But \u2014 for instance, the swabs are coming in by the millions. They\u2019re coming in \u2014 literally coming in by the millions. Totally ordered. We wanted the highest quality. We could have gotten a much lesser quality. We didn\u2019t want to do that. We got the highest quality. But, testing \u2014 it\u2019s like no matter how well you do, you can always say more. With the ventilators, they either have them or they don\u2019t. In fact, we went to one meeting \u2014 \u201cWho wants a ventilator?\u201d One governor \u2014 one governor said, \u201cWe\u2019d like 25.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five. You got them. Who else?\u201d Nobody spoke up. That was four weeks ago. So that was great. The problem with the testing is, as I said, if we test \u2014 if we tested 350 million people, you\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, we want them to have a second test or a third test or a fourth test.\u201d Not everybody believes as strongly as some people in testing. Some people want to do testing because they think it\u2019s impossible for us to fulfill that goal. That\u2019s easy compared to ventilators, as I\u2019ve said. But we have a tremendous testing capability \u2014 better than anybody in the world right now. And every day, it\u2019s growing. And it\u2019s growing very substantial. I mean, these doctors are very talented people. They\u2019ve seen testing all their lives. They\u2019ve never seen anything like we\u2019ve been able to do. So, we\u2019re going to give everybody what they want with the testing. But again, testing \u2014 and I\u2019ve said it from the beginning: The actual test has to be administered locally. You can\u2019t do from Washington or faraway locations \u2014 federal testing \u2014 nearly as well as you can, where you have a governor, he has mayors, and they have representatives, and \u2014 and they know the back of a Walmart \u2014 put it in the parking lot in the back of a Walmart or put it in a certain location in different states. They\u2019re doing it beautifully. It\u2019s working beautifully. The relationship I have with the governors, and Mike has, and we all have with the governors, I would say, other than one or two \u2014 but even them, they don\u2019t complain. They\u2019re not complaining. So we\u2019re doing tremendous testing. And ultimately, we\u2019re doing more testing, I think, than probably any of the governors even want. Okay. Please, Jennifer. Q Back on the immigration EO \u2014 can you say, is it just for green cards \u2014 for green card holders or is it \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s green cards for \u2014 subject \u2014 Q Is it also for people seeking temporary work visas? THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s subject to change. We have some people coming in, for instance, helping the farmers. We want to have the farmers take care \u2014 they\u2019ve been coming for years and years, and they\u2019re helping our farmers, and they\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve been coming in for years. We don\u2019t want to do \u2014 you know, the border has been turned off a number of times over the years. And you know what happened? Our farmers all went out of business. They were out of business. They couldn\u2019t farm. We\u2019re taking care of our farmers. Nobody ever took care of farmers like I take care of farmers. Q Subject to change because some \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Including the $19 billion that we\u2019re dispersing to farmers because of some very good things that happened. Q Subject to change because some of your advisors are saying there could be a problem with it, or subject to change because you want to extend it? THE PRESIDENT: No, no. Just it might be modified. It could be modified next week, in two weeks. It could be modified in two months. No, we may modify it as we go along. But right now, we have a very powerful immigration ban, but it could be modified \u2014 meaning made tougher or made less tough. We don\u2019t want to hurt our businesses, and we don\u2019t want to hurt our farmers. Very important. Q Mr. President, can I ask you about your conversation with Governor Kemp? What did he say to you when you said you strongly disagreed with him? And, of course, for gym owners and tattoo parlor artists and barbers in Atlanta \u2014 I mean, Georgia, generally \u2014 would you advise them to listen to you and not to their governor? THE PRESIDENT: Look, I\u2019d like them to listen to their governors. All of their governors. I have the right to do, if I wanted to clamp it down, but I have respect for our governors. They know what they\u2019re doing, I think. And, as you know, Brian Kemp, governor of Georgia, I worked very hard for his election. He beat their superstar. He beat the superstar of their party. I think you can say, I helped a lot. Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey \u2014 they all went in. They campaigned for him very, very hard, and he lost. He also was way down in a primary, and he ended up winning a primary after I came out and endorsed him. So, a lot of good things and there\u2019s a lot of good feeling between myself and Brian Kemp. I like him a lot. I happen to disagree with him only on time and timing. I disagree. When you have spas, beauty parlors \u2014 and I love these people \u2014 I know the people from spas and beauty parlors, tattoo parlors. Bikers for Trump \u2014 a lot of tattoos. I love them. I love these people. And barbershops. These are great people. But you know what? Maybe you wait a little bit longer until you get into a phase two. So do I agree with him? No. But I respect him, and I will let him make his decision. Would I do that? No. I\u2019d keep them a little longer. I want to protect people\u2019s lives. But I\u2019m going to let him make his decision. But I told him: I totally disagree. Okay. Q Thank you, Mr. President. The Vice President, in his remarks, was talking about the federal efforts that have been undertaken as it relates to nursing facilities. And, as you both know, they\u2019ve been just so incredibly hard hit \u2014 just tragic \u2014 over 10,000 COVID-19 deaths so far. The industry says that they\u2019re struggling as it relates to testing. Can you commit to increasing testing at the nursing facilities across the country? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Well, we\u2019re doing that automatically. I mean, that\u2019s almost common sense. But we\u2019re doing that automat- \u2014 I mean, you look at the State of Washington. That was our first glimpse of it. They got hit so horribly in that nursing home. It seems \u2014 it seemed like everybody was from a particular nursing home. So we knew immediately that was going to be a problem. And we\u2019re doing that, 100 percent. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I can speak to \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re taking very special care of our nursing homes and our seniors, other than me. Other than me. Nobody wants to take care of me. But other than me, we\u2019re taking care of our seniors. Q Another \u2014 another \u2014 THE VICE PRESIDENT: I can speak to that as well. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, please, Mike. Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. Vice President. THE VICE PRESIDENT: No, it\u2019s just an enormously important question. And we want to thank the American people who have been putting off visits to their grandmothers and grandfathers and moms and dads. It\u2019s tough. I\u2019m going to be in Indiana next week, and I\u2019m not going to go see my mom. She lives in her own home, but people get it that the risk of serious illness for a healthy American of the coronavirus is fairly low. You\u2019ll either have flu-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. But as we\u2019ve said so many times at this podium and the American people get it: A healthy American could inadvertently convey the coronavirus to a senior with an underlying health condition and have the kind of heartbreaking results that we\u2019ve seen in nursing homes around the country. It\u2019s the reason why, from early on, the President took decisive action to raise the infectious disease standards at every nursing home in America. He deployed all 8,000 of our inspectors at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to dedicate all of their time to ensuring compliance with those new higher standards. And we\u2019ve spoken about \u2014 about nursing home issues with governors around the country. And frankly, there are governors around the country that have done remarkable work with nursing homes. You mentioned Governor Brian Kemp. He actually used the National Guard. In Georgia, he deployed them to nursing homes to do cleaning and to disinfect areas of those nursing homes. And it\u2019s a tremendous service. But to your point about testing, if you look carefully at the Guidelines to Open Up America Again, you will see that in phase one, the level of testing that we contemplate is first that we want to be able to test anyone who has the symptoms that may be coronavirus, and be able to test them quickly. Secondly, we want to do the kind of contact tracing \u2014 and Dr. Redfield and his team are deploying CDC teams in every state in America \u2014 to be able to find out everyone that that person has been in contact with and test them. But if you look right underneath that, what we\u2019re directing states to do is be prepared to deploy testing resources first and foremost to nursing homes and long-term care facilities so that we can monitor any potential outbreak of the coronavirus among the most vulnerable population. Thanks to the leadership of our Surgeon General, as the President announced today, we\u2019re also going to be deploying testing resources to vulnerable communities, to underserved communities. The CDC released new preliminary data on the impact, particularly, on African American communities in this country. And it\u2019s the reason why part of our phase-one recommendation is that we deploy testing resources into those communities that are described by the doctors as socially vulnerable. And, even as we speak, we\u2019ll announce next week that we\u2019re already in the process of deploying testing. And so it\u2019s a good opportunity to remind every American to be especially careful around our seniors and to heed the guidance about avoiding visitations to protect the health of those who are most vulnerable. But the American people can be assured that from phase one forward, all the way through phase three and reopening, we\u2019re going to be helping to guide the states to focus on the most vulnerable, beginning with our seniors with serious underlying health conditions. Q Mr. Vice President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: How about right behind Jennifer? Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ll get back \u2014 we\u2019ll get back to you. Q Commercial labs say that they need to buy new diagnostic machines to be able to double their testing capacity. Your administration has said that there is enough testing capacity to double overnight. How do you, kind of, square that difference? THE PRESIDENT: Very easy. They can get new machines if they want, but even if they didn\u2019t, we have tremendous testing capability. You take a look at what\u2019s happening in California and New York. Governor Cuomo told us very strongly \u2014 he said, \u201cWow, we have a lot of labs.\u201d You know, that\u2019s a research center of the world. They have tremendous \u2014 in California, too. Long conversations. They have tremendous testing capability there too. Now, if they want to increase it, they can increase it, but they have plenty right now. You saw the maps the other day, when we put up the different sites in various states, and virtually all states are like that. How about you with the mask? Nice that you wear a mask. Q Yes. Mr. President, may I actually follow up on those maps from the other day? On Monday, a reporter for a local television station in Miami sent me a question asking if it was possible to get the information on those maps distributed to the media so that local TV stations and newspapers can check on that information. So if that could that be done \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Who did the maps? Do you \u2014 do you want do that? Do you want to say something? DR. BIRX: Thank you for talking about testing and testing capacity because we have been talking about that for several weeks, because we could see \u2014 and we did a full inventory of every single state and every single laboratory. And I also appreciate you talking about the implementation piece of the testing capacity. And it\u2019s complicated, so we have been \u2014 we have a team calling every lab and working through the American Society of Microbiology, as I mentioned before, to really work with every lab director to see what the issues are in each laboratory. And I just want to thank Administrator Verma, who really worked on increasing the funding for this test and uniquely doubling the funding for the coronavirus nucleic acid test from $50 to $100 to really address some of the issues about laboratory technicians. Because sometimes we think these tests run themselves; they don\u2019t. They actually need people to help with the machines. So we were talking about purchasing more machines; we actually need to have additional laboratory technicians to really be able to work all of those machines. And so it\u2019s lab by lab, state by state, and that\u2019s the dialogue that\u2019s going on now to unlock the full potential of the United States. Maybe the testing would not be needed at this moment, and maybe it is, but we want it also totally available in the fall if it comes to an issue where we have to distinguish between flu and COVID-19. So we\u2019re building infrastructure and capacity not only for today, but for tomorrow, and really showing a new way to really deal with pandemics and bring testing to scale. Because the country has never had to do this before. I mean, if you look at some of the other countries, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re struggling with some of the issues, from PPE to testing. And so this is a universal issue, but we\u2019re working on it as a collective to really have a very innovative and integrated way to approach testing. THE PRESIDENT: But without building new, they have tremendous capability. And \u2014 DR. BIRX: And the maps are \u2014 I will ask the companies, because, obviously, it\u2019s proprietary where every single machine is. And, you know, if you have that machine and five others, maybe you don\u2019t want to know \u2014 let that person know you have five others. It\u2019s kind of like Coke and Pepsi. So I think we\u2019re working very deliberately to really be able to share those maps. The governors, I can tell you that they \u2014 all of the state and local gover- \u2014 state governors and the mayors have those maps and the addresses and the type of machine for every single laboratory in their jurisdiction so know who they\u2019re testing. THE PRESIDENT: And many of the governors were not aware that those laboratories were available. Q One more for Dr. Birx, before you leave, on the \u2014 the state of California has now partially broken with CDC restrictions on who will get guidance and who should get testing because they want to test people without any symptoms at all in high-risk environments, like a nursing home. Do you agree with this? Vice President Pence, do you agree with this? DR. BIRX: Well, not only do we agree with it; it was in our guidelines. THE VICE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s in our guidelines. DR. BIRX: That was fundamental to our guidelines, and I think we were the first group that said testing asymptomatics will be key. We\u2019ve always said that we think that\u2019s a significant contribution to infections. And we went to the places where we thought it was most critical to find cases the earliest. And so that is where we have asked states in the guidelines to start with nursing home, indigenous peoples, and people in underserved areas and cities to really ensure that we\u2019re monitoring for any type, because we know the asymptomatic piece may be the tip of the iceberg. In fact, it\u2019d be the iceberg underneath the surface. And so if you\u2019re only seeing cases and maybe this. But in parallel, we\u2019re working with states and local governments to really define what that population is by doing \u2014 in collaboration with states, working with them together, to really reinforce this antibody testing but in a careful way where you do two antibody testing to increase your sensitivity and specificity into the 99-plus percent range, because we think it\u2019s really important that you have a very high-quality test, but a high-quality test that you can really tell someone that they\u2019ve had this before. And so we\u2019re waiting to have those two tests that we can do in series to really assure people. But that is \u2014 that was in the guidelines from the very beginning, and we think it\u2019s fundamental, both for right now and going through the fall, because that will be our early alert if any of the COVID virus reappears. Q So how much more testing are we going to need? How much \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Jon, you didn\u2019t know that was in the guidelines? Q The CDC criteria says that (inaudible) \u2014 Q Well, it\u2019s currently in the CDC guidelines. You\u2019re saying that \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, but it\u2019s right \u2014 but it\u2019s right in the guidelines. Q Dr. Birx \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m surprised at you. Q \u2014 while you\u2019re there, can I just \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Jerome, would you like to say something on that, please? Please. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: Thank you, Mr. President. And I just want to reiterate to everyone that the task force and the administration have a commitment to protecting vulnerable people, and that includes in the area of testing. We\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk to many different groups, and we hear that testing is absolutely a concern. And we\u2019ll be giving you more details in the coming days, but I just want you to know that we\u2019re building on the public-private partnership that the President rolled out with pharmacy and retail companies like CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Walmart, and Kroger to accelerate testing for more Americans and more communities across the nation. We\u2019re going to be increasing access to testing for under-tested, underserved, and minority communities. And we\u2019re working closely with partners and states to establish sites in areas most in need of increased access to testing. We\u2019re using data \u2014 CDC-provided data \u2014 to locate sites and counties that are under-tested and socially vulnerable, especially with high populations of black, Hispanic, rural, and Native Americans. We\u2019re using the CDC\u2019s Vulnerability Index, as you heard about \u2014 heard about earlier to select sites. And this measures the resilience of communities when confronted by external stressors along four main themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status, and housing type. Our goal \u2014 our goal is to have about two-thirds of these initial sites located in counties with moderate to high social vulnerability and about a quarter of these sites and counties with high social vulnerability. So again, I want communities that are vulnerable to understand that we are strategically and intentionally making sure we\u2019re deploying testing in those areas so that people can get identified if they have symptoms, can get identified if they are asymptomatic, and that we will be able to deploy resources appropriately. Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jerome. Thank you. And I have to say our Surgeon General is doing a great job. Thank you. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Really good. OAN, in the back, please. Q Mr. President, thank you. Can we talk about Iran? You put out a message this morning making a rather big announcement for our military when it comes to Iranians\u2019 \u2014 Iranian aggression. Are you going to change, formally, rules of engagement for our U.S. military so that they can engage? THE PRESIDENT: No. We\u2019re covered \u2014 we\u2019re covered 100 percent. We don\u2019t want their gunboats surrounding our boats and traveling around our boats and having a good time. We don\u2019t want them anywhere near our boats. And \u2014 so you know the order I gave. I don\u2019t think I have to say it again, but I\u2019ve given that order. Under the Obama administration, it was taking place all the time. Under my administration, I gave this order early on and nothing happened. They were very nice; they were no problem. But then I noticed yesterday, they did that in a much lighter form, but they did that again. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to \u2014 we\u2019re not going to stand for it.\u201d So if they do that, that\u2019s putting our ships at danger and our great crews and sailors at \u2014 in danger. I\u2019m not going to let that happen. And we will \u2014 they\u2019ll shoot them out of the water. Q So the U.S. military does not have to change its rules of engagement in order to follow your directive? THE PRESIDENT: No, that\u2019s not rules of engagement; that\u2019s a threat when they get that close to our boat. And they have guns. They have very substantial weapons on those boats. But we\u2019ll shoot them out of the water. Okay? Please. Q Thank you, President Trump. If possible, I\u2019d like to ask a question to Dr. Fauci and then a very different one to you. To Dr. Fauci, today the CDC and the USDA said that the first pets in America had tested positive for coronavirus. What does that mean, and what should the public know about that? DR. FAUCI: Pets? Q Pets. Two pets. THE PRESIDENT: Pets. DR. FAUCI: So that question was asked before, but I\u2019d be happy to answer it again. Certainly, animals, pets can get infected. Big cats in zoos have been reported to be infected with coronavirus. There is no evidence that the virus is transmitted from a pet to a human. Now, obviously, is that impossible? I mean, biologically, you know, anything is possible, but there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that we\u2019ve seen, from an epidemiological standpoint, that pets can be transmitters within the household. So, it\u2019s not surprising. I mean, we \u2014 when you have viruses that can infect multiple species, isolating it from an animal doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it. THE PRESIDENT: What about the lion in the New York Zoo? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, well, you know, that\u2019s the lion in the New York \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: How did that \u2014 how did that happen? DR. FAUCI: You know what probably happened? I don\u2019t know, Mr. President, but I would imagine that one of the \u2014 one of the zookeepers probably had an asymptomatic infection, took care of the animal, gave him some food, touched him or whatever, and that\u2019s how he got it. Q A question for you, President Trump. My question for you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q \u2014 is: Earlier in these briefings, you talked a lot about giving Americans hope and you wanted to focus on that. But now that the crisis seems to perhaps be lessening, I wanted to ask you about accountability. And, of course, million \u2014 millions of Americans became familiar with you as the tough boss who fired people for doing a poor job. I wanted to ask you about two specific things. There was a report from Reuters today that the HHS Secretary put a former dog breeder in charge of day-to-day coronavirus efforts, to begin with. And also on \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: He did what? What? Q Reuters reported today that Alex Azar, the Secretary of HHS, put a former dog breeder \u2014 that was his most recently former job \u2014 in charge of day-to-day operations of the coronavirus. THE PRESIDENT: That, I don\u2019t know. But I \u2014 you\u2019re just telling me something. And what\u2019s the second? Q And the second one is on face masks. Taiwan has a bigger population than New York State. Early on, they had universal wearing of face masks. Here \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No problem with face masks, if the governors want to do that. You know, we ordered \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you know \u2014 500 million face masks. We have hundreds of millions right now. And if people want to wear them, it\u2019s up to the governors. If the governors want that, it\u2019s absolutely \u2014 now, it\u2019s more appropriate in some states, obviously, than others. You have the big plains and you have certain states where it\u2019s much less necessary. But, no, that\u2019s up to the governors. And we have that very well covered, I think, face masks. But we have \u2014 Q Here, people aren\u2019t wearing masks. THE PRESIDENT: We have hundreds of millions of face masks, and we have at least 500 million. That\u2019s a lot. We\u2019ll have them very shortly. Q And lots of people are wearing face masks now that the federal government advised. It was almost overnight. But less than a month ago, our Surgeon General said that \u2014 and I\u2019m quoting \u2014 they\u2019re, quote, \u201cnot effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus.\u201d I mean, is \u2014 should there be accountability there and also from HHS Secretary? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. Would anybody like to speak about it? I don\u2019t \u2014 I think, if \u2014 for \u2014 as \u2014 just so you understand, if somebody wants to wear them, I\u2019m all for it. Would somebody like to discuss that? THE VICE PRESIDENT: Bob Redfield. Bob. DR. FAUCI: Go \u2014 go for it, Bob. DR. REDFIELD: I think the comments that we made when we came into face masks \u2014 and I think it\u2019s important when we came out with the CDC guidance about face masks, or what we called \u201cface coverings\u201d \u2014 was, in recognition of the growing understanding of asymptomatic infection or pre-symptomatic infection, was the recognition that we could use a barrier. And the reason \u2014 you know, and I have mine when I\u2019m in public, right here, that I use \u2014 you know, that this barrier, in case I was, in fact, infected if I didn\u2019t know, is a barrier to prevent me to protect you in case I happened to be asymptomatically infected. There\u2019s very good data to show that the ability of viral particles to go through a barrier is substantially dishmininished [sic] \u2014 diminished. And that\u2019s why we recommended these face coverings. I think if you go back to when CDC came out with that recommendation, some people may think, intuitively, it\u2019s to protect them from getting infected. No, it was to protect you from potentially getting infected by me when I go out in public. Jerome, do you \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Jerome, please. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: I actually appreciate you asking that question because it\u2019s one that \u2014 that we\u2019ve had to clarify several times, and I understand why the American public has been confused over time. As Dr. Redfield mentioned, initially we said, based on CDC, World Health Organization, and most other major public health organizations that the public needed to know that these masks are not effective or shown to be effective in preventing you, if you wear a mask, from catching coronavirus. Another important thing to remember is the context of those statements was a run on medical masks, on N95 masks, and our healthcare workers were at risk. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Right. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: What\u2019s changed? What\u2019s changed is, we found out that, unlike past viruses that are spread through the respiratory route, a significant proportion of coronavirus cases can be traced back to asymptomatic spread. So the task force deliberated this. We\u2019ve always told you that we will look at the facts and we will give people recommendations based on the best available evidence at the time. And once we saw that asymptomatic spread, we said, \u201cWell, masks still aren\u2019t effective, from our point of view, at preventing you from catching coronavirus in a significant way.\u201d But we\u2019ve always told people that they should wear masks, if they know they have symptoms, to prevent them from spreading to other people. Well, now that we know about 25 to 50 percent of people are spreading asymptomatically, we suggested people wear cloth facial coverings to prevent asymptomatic spread. You wear your mask to protect me. I wear my mask \u2014 and Dr. Redfield mentioned it \u2014 I\u2019ve got my mask \u2014 I believe I have mine on me, Bob. I carry mine around with me too. I wear my mask to protect you. We\u2019re six feet away, which is why I\u2019m not wearing my mask to protect you now, and we also all have been tested. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m not wearing mine now. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, but I\u2019m right next to you, so. (Laughter.) SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: Well, I\u2019ll put mine on if you want me to, sir. But \u2014 but again, important to note that if you\u2019re going to wear a mask, it\u2019s not a substitute for social distancing. Still, social distancing is the number one thing you can do. Number two, it\u2019s important to know that you should practice good hand hygiene and not touch your face, because you still can touch a surface and bring disease to your face. And number three \u2014 this is the most important \u2014 well, it\u2019s just as important: Please, save the medical masks, the N95s for the healthcare workers, because the cloth facial coverings are effective, as far as we know right now, based on the best available evidence, at preventing you from spreading disease to other people. So no inconsistency there. It\u2019s just the recommendation changed because the information changed, and that\u2019s what you want from your public health leaders. Q There\u2019s been the now argument made that you knew about the asymptomatic transmission at the time that you said that and that you were essentially misleading the public? THE PRESIDENT: No, I think it\u2019s (inaudible). SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: Well, I made \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s answered that question. SURGEON GENERAL ADAMS: The honest answer to you is: No, we did not. That was a recommendation of the World Health Organization and the CDC, and we gave you the best information we could at the time. So I actually, a little bit, resent that implication because I work hard to try to protect the American people, and we are always going to give the American people the best information we have available at the time. And we don\u2019t \u2014 and we have \u2014 we\u2019re humble enough to say, \u201cLook, if we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re going to change. We\u2019re going to change our recommendations.\u201d THE PRESIDENT: Just a wise-guy question, that\u2019s all. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Please, go ahead. Q Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the launch of the military satellite by Iran. I wanted to get your response to that. Do you see this an advancement of the missile program? THE PRESIDENT: You mean the shot they took? Well, they say no. Okay? They say all sorts. \u201cIt was for television\u201d. Does anybody really believe that? They want to have better television in Iran, so they say. No, we\u2019re watching Iran very closely. Very closely. Q Are you concerned \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: We know more about Iran than they do. Right now, we know more than they do. So we know all about it. We watched it; we knew it was going up. We followed it very closely. They say it was for television. Yes, please. Q Are you concerned, though, Mr. President? Q Mr. President, I have a question for Dr. Fauci. THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Finish up there, please. Q Yeah, very quickly. Are you concerned that they see this as a potential vulnerability on the part of the United States? There is the outbreak \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: See what? What is vulnerable? Q Military readiness. The outbreak on the Roosevelt, the fact that you\u2019re consumed with dealing with coronavirus here in the United States. THE PRESIDENT: Her, I read where various navies have had outbreaks of COVID. Look, we\u2019re in 184 different \u2014 different nations right now. A hundred and eight-four \u2014 the COVID. No, we have a problem on \u2014 that just shows you how rapidly it spreads. It started off with two sailors and then 10 sailors and 20, and now I hear it\u2019s 540, of which one has died and a few are very sick. But most of them are back in \u2014 you know, in great shape. But we did \u2014 we did lose one, and it attacked the lungs of that young person. And then we also had a number of that were quite sick, but they\u2019re all either better or getting better. But most of them are better for a long time already. Okay, please. Q Mr. President, can I \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, just one second. Q Thanks, Mr. President. As you know, over the course of the past few weeks, there have been the closures of several meat-processing companies across the country in several states. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q Is this a concern to you? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q Are you going to increase testing in these facilities because the workforce is getting sick? THE PRESIDENT: Look at South Dakota, how well the governor is \u2014 yeah, look at South Dakota, how well the governor has done there. And, all of a sudden, you have a big spike in one location. And she\u2019s got that very much under control, as you know. But nevertheless, that was surprising. And they had a big one right near where you were yesterday, as I understand it. And \u2014 so yeah, we\u2019re concerned about that. Q Is the food supply \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re closing one or two of the plants, actually. Q Is the food supply secure? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, totally secure. It\u2019s in great shape. Yeah, in the back. You didn\u2019t go. Q Thank you, Mr. President. The Attorney General in the State of Missouri filed a law \u2014 a law case against China \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Against China. Q \u2014 accusing it of lying and covering up about the origin of the virus. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q Do support that? And do you call for international \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Well, I haven\u2019t seen the case. I know about the case. He filed a case against China. I love Missouri, as you know. It\u2019s great. But I\u2019m going to take a look at it. I actually know about it very much. I have to take a look at it. I have not seen the case, in terms of reading it, but I will be doing that. Q But would you call for international investigation? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re going to have to take a look. Oh, we\u2019re doing investigations. We\u2019re doing our own. But I do want to see and review that lawsuit. I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t be the last one. Yeah. Q Mr. President, yes, I just had a follow \u2014 a question for Dr. Fauci, if you don\u2019t mind. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure. Q And I\u2019m happy to ask you one after. So Jon had asked the President about Rick Bright, and he said he wasn\u2019t sure who that was, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar who he is since he was the head of BARDA. So this concern or an accusation he\u2019s raised that he was removed from his job because he protested widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, are you familiar with the situation? And do you feel like public health experts feel they are able to speak publicly or to speak out in opposition to the things? DR. FAUCI: Here I am. Q Yeah. DR. FAUCI: So you don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any concern among \u2014 DR. FAUCI: No. No. Q \u2014 people at the NIH right now or in the public health community? DR. FAUCI: At the NIH, absolutely not. Q Dr. Fauci, knowing Dr. Bright and knowing what his gifts are as one of the country\u2019s leading experts on vaccines, are those gifts best suited at NIH rather than BARDA? What\u2019s he going to be doing with you? DR. FAUCI: What is he going to be doing at the NIH? Q So, first of all, are his gifts best suited to work with you rather than BARDA? DR. FAUCI: No, I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t really think I can comment on somebody\u2019s relative gifts. I mean, he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s going to be at the NIH, and he\u2019s going to be responsible, from what I hear \u2014 again, this is what I\u2019ve heard \u2014 that he\u2019s going to be responsible for the development of diagnostics, which is very, very important. The NIH is going to be involved in trying to develop new-generation diagnostics, which we feel is going to be very important for the future of being able to facilitate the kinds of things that now are sometimes problematic. Q Are you concerned at all that he \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And why did you say that he has great gifts or gifts? What, do you know him? Q Well, that\u2019s his expertise. I mean, I\u2019m just looking at his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but have you reviewed him? Have you \u2014 have you studied him? Have you reported on him? You said, \u201chis gifts.\u201d His gifts. I mean \u2014 Q He\u2019s worked his entire career developing vaccines, including the \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Well, that doesn\u2019t mean you have gifts. I know a lot of people, they play baseball, but they can\u2019t hit 150 in the Major Leagues. Q Well, he helped develop the flu vaccine last year. THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but you talk about his great gifts. Go ahead, please. Q Mr. President, thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Please, go ahead. You can go. Please. Q Thank you, sir. I have two questions, one for myself and then one for a colleague of ours who cannot be here today because of social distancing. THE PRESIDENT: From where? From where? Q I\u2019m with USA Today. First, the executive director of the National Association of Counties said today that the White House did not want to see money for local \u2014 state and local governments in the latest COVID assistance package. THE PRESIDENT: And they didn\u2019t want to say what? What does that mean? Tell me. Q I\u2019m sorry? THE PRESIDENT: What does it mean? Repeat it. Say it a little differently. Q The executive director of the National Association of Counties said today that the White House objected to putting funding for state and local governments into the latest COVID assistance package. THE PRESIDENT: Oh, really? That\u2019s interest- \u2014 is he a Democrat? Q I do not know, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Well, check it. How can you ask that questions without knowing? Q Okay. Well \u2014 but what \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Check it out. You\u2019ll find out. Q I\u2019ll check it out. But he says \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Okay, what\u2019s the next question? Q His question was \u2014 THE President: You know, the numbers \u2014 you know, the money we put into states, local governments, everything else? And they have to be responsible for their own finances. But you check it out. Go ahead. What\u2019s the next \u2014 Q Well, his point was \u2014 he said that you felt like that this would somehow be a disincentive for states to open their economies. Is he correct about that? THE PRESIDENT: How would he know what I felt? I never spoke to him. I don\u2019t even know who he is. Q I\u2019m asking you, sir. THE PRESIDENT: You don\u2019t know who he is either. Q Yes, his name is Matthew Chase, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Okay, it doesn\u2019t help me, and it doesn\u2019t help you. Okay, go ahead, Jeff. Q Mr. President, also a follow-up \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Do we want to keep going a little while longer or no? Q Yes. Yes. THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re not going to say, \u201cOh, he took questions all night long\u201d? Q No, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Okay? Right? Q Yes, please. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Okay, well, good. How many questions can you ask? Go ahead. Q Also \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: We \u2014 we all have fun, because we\u2019re talking about something very important. The main thing is I think we\u2019re getting to a lot of solutions. We never want this to happen again. We never want this to happen again \u2014 what happened. And if it should come back in some form, we want to snuff it out very quickly before anything can happen. And I personally hope it doesn\u2019t come back in the fall as a combination of the flu or not as a combination of the flu. But I think we learned a lot. And, you know, some of these questions are good. Some of them are ridiculous, frankly, but some of them are very \u2014 I think some of them are very important questions. Very important. You know, when you asked Dr. Fauci about the right to speak \u2014 if I let him speak, I\u2019ll let anybody speak. And we love him. Let\u2019s go. Q Mr. President, Senator \u2014 Senator McConnell said today that he would prefer to see states that have high public pensions declare bankruptcy, rather than taking on more \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I \u2014 I heard he said that. Q \u2014 federal bailout money. THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know what he said. I\u2019ll have to call him and ask him. Q That\u2019s what he said. THE PRESIDENT: Well, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to have to look at it directly. Q Would you agree with him on that? Or \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I can\u2019t tell you that. I have to see \u2014 I want to base it on fact and reason. I want to see what he said \u2014 you know, why he said it and how he said it. I\u2019d have to watch him say it. But some of the states are not doing well, let\u2019s face it. And some are doing phenomenally well. A state where Mike was governor, Indiana \u2014 I looked at their numbers. They have \u2014 it\u2019s incredible what they\u2019re doing. Some states are doing fantastically well. Iowa is doing great. You have \u2014 you have states doing well, and you have some states that aren\u2019t doing well. We know the ones. I don\u2019t have to mention the ones that aren\u2019t doing well, but you do have states that are in trouble. And certainly they\u2019re coming back to talk to us. We\u2019ll see what happens. Q Are you concerned \u2014 are you concerned, sir, about the growing U.S. national debt as a result of these stimulus packages? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we have a choice. Do we have a choice? Yeah. I\u2019m always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem. This was \u2014 we were attacked. This was an attack. This wasn\u2019t just, \u201cOh, gee.\u201d And this wasn\u2019t the flu, by the way. You know, they like to say the flu. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. 1917 was the last time. We were attacked. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy \u2014 better than China, better than any place. They will tell you that. I dealt with them for a long time, and they will tell \u2014 we have the greatest economy and we built it in the last three years, three and a half years we built it. And then one day, they came and they said, \u201cYou have to close it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got to be\u2026\u201d \u201cThese people right here, they said you have to\u2026\u201d They came into my office \u2014 into the Oval Office, and they said, \u201cWe have to close the economy.\u201d I said, \u201cLet\u2019s explain this. Explain this to me.\u201d The greatest ever in history and we had to close it. Now we\u2019re going to open it again, and we\u2019re going to be just as strong or stronger. But you have to spend some money to get",

                              "text": "Rose Garden March 29, 2020 5:43 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody being here. Beautiful day in the Rose Garden. Tremendous distance between chairs. Social distancing. You practice it very well. We appreciate it. That\u2019s great. I want to start today by highlighting several critical developments on both the testing and treatment that will help us win our war against the coronavirus. On Friday, the FDA authorized a new test developed by Abbott Labs that delivers lightning-fast results in as little as five minutes. That\u2019s a whole new ballgame. I want to thank Abbott Labs for the incredible work they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve been working around the clock. Normally, this approval process from the FDA would take 10 months, and even longer, but we did it in four weeks. Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week. And as you know, even before this development, we\u2019ve been doing more test \u2014 tests than any other country anywhere in the world. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we\u2019ve been testing. It\u2019s also one of the reasons that we\u2019re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we\u2019ve been doing more testing. So we have bigger numbers to look at. I want to also thank General Semonite, of the Army Corps of Engineers, and General Polowczyk, who\u2019s here with us, who\u2019s going to say a few words in a little while. What the Army Corps of Engineers did, along with FEMA, in New York was incredible. They built 2,900 beds\u2019 worth of hospital. An incredible hospital in the Javits Center, which I know well. And I just want to say that was unreal. They did it in less than four days. People have never seen anything like that. And it\u2019s an incredible, complex, top-of-the-line hospital. They did it so quickly. Everyone is trying to figure out how they did it, including me \u2014 and I was a good builder. But they did it very quickly, Mike. So we\u2019re very \u2014 we\u2019re very happy. So I want to thank Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA \u2014 the incredible job they have done. Now they\u2019re moving to other locations throughout the country where they already have people building hospitals. We\u2019re doing them in Louisiana and New Jersey \u2014 many, many other places. But these are incredible men and women, and they worked around the clock. And the people of New York are very happy. Governor Cuomo expressed his thanks, which we appreciate. But these are \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s nobody could have done a job like that. Most people have never seen anything like it. The deployment of rapid testing will vastly accelerate our ability to monitor, track, contain, and ultimately defeat the virus. We will defeat the virus. It will also allow us to test doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers immediately and enable us to act quickly and aggressively to shut down the spread of the virus \u2014 so important \u2014 in critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes. And we will ensure that we can give cities and states the best information to guide local decision makers and making. I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients \u2014 people in New York \u2014 along with the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin. And it\u2019s very early yet; it\u2019s only \u2014 it started two days ago. But we will see what happens. I want to thank Stephen Hahn, who\u2019s a great doctor \u2014 left one of the best jobs in our country running an incredible Hospital in Texas. And he\u2019s the head of the FDA. And Stephen got approval for that so fast. Let\u2019s see how it works. It may, it may not. But we may have some incredible results. We\u2019re going to know soon. So it\u2019s tested \u2014 it\u2019s being tested on 1,100 people in New York. The FDA is also allowing the emergency use of a blood-related therapy called convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for seriously ill patients. This treatment involves taking blood plasma from patients who have already recovered from the virus. So they\u2019ve recovered; they\u2019re strong. Something was good in them that worked. And so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well \u2014 meaning, their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus \u2014 and transfusing it into six [six] patients \u2014 sick patients, very \u2014 very, very powerfully. So, sick patients will be transfused with the blood taken to boost their immune system. We\u2019ll see what happens. And we\u2019re having some early results that are good, but we will see. And that\u2019s going, I think, very rapidly. Again, we got approvals in, really, very quick time. We\u2019re also looking at an approval for the sterilization of masks. I kept saying to myself \u2014 I\u2019d see some of the masks are very complex. We\u2019re delivering millions, by the way. Millions. But I kept saying, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they able to use that mask a second, third, fourth time?\u201d And Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, called me. They have a company that is in the final process of getting approval for the sterilization of masks, and in some cases, depending on the mask \u2014 some of these masks are very, very strong, very powerful, very strong material \u2014 they\u2019re able to sterilize the mask up to 20 times. So that\u2019s, I guess, like getting 20 masks. And so we worked on that. As soon as I heard from Mike today, I got involved, and the FDA is now involved. And we\u2019re trying to get a fast approval for the sterilization of masks. That would be a tremendous difference. That would be really helpful. While much of the research has to be done \u2014 we have a lot of research left to do, obviously \u2014 this treatment on plasma has shown promising results in other countries. We\u2019re in communication with other countries, and very strong communications. And they\u2019re very reliant on us in just about all cases. We have the greatest people in the world. They\u2019re very, very anxious to find out how we\u2019re doing on our different things, whether it\u2019s a cure or whether it\u2019s really anything having to do with getting people better. We have some interesting things will be announced, I think over the next few weeks, but we\u2019ll see what happens. They\u2019re being tested right now. The vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer, but I\u2019d like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick. And we\u2019re working on that at a level that people would be amazed. These are incredible people. They don\u2019t stop. This method also has been used for more than a century \u2014 and that\u2019s the blood-related therapy \u2014 you know, more than a century to fight off infectious diseases. So it\u2019s not unusual. Our level of complexity has changed, but it\u2019s a concept that\u2019s been used for a long time, including during the Spanish Flu epidemic. And that was really a pandemic of proportions like, frankly, nobody has seen until what we\u2019re facing now. That was in 1918. You know what the result of that was; probably from 75 to 100 million people were killed. And also, other viruses, like the one in this outbreak \u2014 this is a very tough one. This is a tough one because it spreads so quickly, like nothing we\u2019ve seen. It spreads so easily, so quickly. We\u2019re unleashing every tool in our nation\u2019s vast arsenal \u2014 economic, medal [sic] \u2014 medical. If you look, medical, and scientific, military. Homeland Security is working very, very hard with all of them in order to vanquish the virus. As you know, every level of government \u2014 state, local, and federal \u2014 is working nonstop to obtain more personal protective equipment for frontline workers. We\u2019re delivering vast orders of this material. I\u2019m going to ask a couple of the people here to join me that both make it and deliver it. Joining us today are the leaders of America\u2019s largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, including McKesson, Cardinal Health, Henry Schein, Owens & Minor, Medline, FedEx, and UPS. We just concluded a very productive meeting about ways to keep our supply chains and delivery systems moving at top speed. And maybe I\u2019d like to just ask for a couple of minutes for Mike Kaufmann to come up, and maybe Ed Pesicka. Mike is with Cardinal and Ed is Owen & Minor. But I \u2014 and I appreciate. And if anybody else has anything, please come up. But if you could come up, Mike, for a second and, Ed, for a second. Just, if you could maybe say what you told me before when we had the meeting. Thank you. MR. KAUFMANN: Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks for your leadership on this. Because of that leadership, we have really seen the government agencies working with industry like no time before. We have seen HHS, FEMA, the CDC work incredibly effectively with all of the distributors, and all of the distributors working together for the good of the people. And all of us have been so focused on making sure that we take care of our customers because our customers are the ones that are taking care of the patients every day. And we need to do everything we can to make things good for them. And so it\u2019s been great to see how well all these government agencies have been coordinating together with us. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. MR. KAUFMANN: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it. Please. MR.PESICKA: Thank you, Mr. President. Let me first start by thanking the administration for all the support you have provided to the industry. And one of the things we did \u2014 we did hear the challenge. And starting in January, we\u2019ve ramped up our production in the Americas, including our facility in North Carolina, where we are now manufacturing an additional 40 to 50 million masks per month to get into the U.S. healthcare system. And we talked a little about this in the pre-meeting: One of the issues we\u2019re struggling with is the demand increase. You know, used an anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly ten- to twenty thousand masks a week are now using two- to three hundred thousand masks a week. So you multiply that times the entire pop- \u2014 the entire U.S., let alone the same demand outside of the U.S. That\u2019s part of the issue we\u2019re running into: Is even with a significant ramp-up in supply, you know, there\u2019s still that demand that is \u2014 that is much greater than that supply. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. MR.PESICKA: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: And I bring that up because when we discussed, back in a room \u2014 we were in a conference room \u2014 a very nice one, actually; it\u2019s called the Cabinet Room \u2014 that statement was made that they\u2019ve been delivering for years, 10- to 20,000 masks. Okay, it\u2019s a New York hospital. Very \u2014 it\u2019s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20, to 300,000? 10- to 20,000 masks to 300,000? Even though this is different, something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So, somebody should probably look into that, because I just don\u2019t see, from a practical standpoint, how that\u2019s possible to go from that to that. And we have that happening in numerous places \u2014 not to that extent; that was the highest number I\u2019ve heard. That\u2019s the highest number you\u2019ve seen, I would imagine, right? But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals. He knows the system better than anybody. And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number. So thank you very much. I hope I didn\u2019t get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York. FEMA is working with these companies to launch Project Airbridge to expedite the movement of critical supplies from other countries to the United States. The first flight arrived at JFK Airport, New York, this morning, filled with 80 tons of personal protective equipment, including 130,000 N95 respirators \u2014 those are the ones that we were talking about before \u2014 1.8 million face masks and gowns, 10.3 million gloves, and many other things. Millions and millions of different items. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights and is adding more daily. We hope to have about 50 flights. We\u2019re going to have \u2014 I think including the one that came in today, we\u2019re up at 51 flights with these massive planes from the different companies. That was so nice to be here today. Would you like to say something on behalf? Please, come up. Thank you. MS. LANE: Thank you, Mr President, for the incredible leadership. I will share with you that UPS is really proud to be part of this effort. Vice President Pence and I had the opportunity to speak before, and the way we\u2019re going to win this war is with great logistics, and UPS is going to be part of that effort. We have a Big Brown army \u2014 495,000 UPSers across the country that are ready to deliver. We\u2019re bringing in the supplies from anywhere around the world as fast as we can so that they can serve the communities that need them most. We\u2019re proud to be partnering with the states as well, because we know that in partnership with those states, we can deliver what is needed everywhere. So thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Great job you\u2019re doing. Please. Thank you very much. MR. TYLER: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I would certainly like to echo my colleagues\u2019 comments that the collaboration amongst many of the government agencies and the private market and the distributors represented here today has been incredible. It has been increasing and ramping up over the past weeks. Today\u2019s first delivery of Operation Airbridge, I think, is the first evidence that it\u2019s working. The 51 flights you referenced we\u2019re excited about. We look to build upon that. So I would echo my thanks for your leadership, and certainly to the staffs, for the terrific partnership and the commitment to protect the people we think about most often, which are the people on the frontlines providing care. And maybe just a quick word of thanks, on behalf of all the CEOs here, to our teams that continue to show up in warehouses across the country, in pharmacies across the country, and do their jobs to keep the supply chain going. The supply chain is working. It\u2019s resilient. Supply is a challenge, and we\u2019re tackling that. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Great job. Please. MR. MILLS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And thanks to FEMA and HHS. I think great leadership, and it\u2019s really working well. The demand has skyrocketed, and we\u2019re doing a lot of things to bring in more masks, more \u2014 other protective apparel. We are involved in reprocessing masks, and we\u2019ve already started at about 100,000 masks per day, and we hope to expand from there. So we\u2019re quite optimistic about it. THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Yeah. MR. MILLS: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Fantastic job. Anybody else, if you want? Yes, please. You\u2019re doing such a great job, we have to \u2014 MR. CONNETT: Well, thanks. THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 have everybody if they want. MR. CONNETT: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. We appreciate the opportunity to work with your administration on a lot of collaborative fronts. Number one, we\u2019ve all talked about PPE products; that\u2019s critical. And it\u2019s not just to the hospitals \u2014 that\u2019s a must \u2014 but it\u2019s really to all healthcare providers out there working on the frontline. So our commitment is there to get it to the hotspots and get it to the care providers that are taking care of those patients. It\u2019s absolutely key. Second, we talked in there about buying in America and getting resources back here and manufacturing in America. That is critical. A lesson to be learned from where we are. And lastly, we\u2019re proud that we introduced a test. We need to get some more tests out there in a rapid form. We\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019ve worked with your administration very closely, and the FDA, and we\u2019re very grateful for that because it\u2019s a quick, rapid antibody test that is needed as well. So we\u2019re really proud to work with your administration. All going well. Thanks so much. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. So thank you all very much and for the great job you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s really incredible, frankly. Many of the states are stocked up. Some of them don\u2019t admit it, but they have \u2014 we have sent just so much \u2014 so many things to them and \u2014 including ventilators. You know, there\u2019s a question as to hoarding of ventilators. Some hospitals and independent hospitals \u2014 and some hospital chains, as we call them \u2014 they are holding ventilators; they don\u2019t want to let them up. We need them for certain areas where there\u2019s big problems. We can\u2019t hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road. So we\u2019ve delivered a lot, and this group has been really fantastic. We want to thank you. And UPS and FedEx, in particular, you\u2019ve gone absolutely out of your way, so we appreciate everything you\u2019ve done and delivered. The federal government continues to mobilize every resource to make sure our frontline doctors and nurses have the equipment needed to save American lives. Yesterday, I visited Naval Station Norfolk as the USNS Comfort departed from New York three weeks ahead of schedule, fully loaded with 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, and hundreds of the best doctors, nurses, and medical professionals anywhere in the United States Navy \u2014 anywhere, frankly, in the United States. It was an incredible thing to see. Mostly you saw that on television as it was leaving. It left literally three weeks early. It was under maintenance, and they got the maintenance done very quickly. They work round the clock as many of the people have. And it was a great sight. Additionally, two of the country\u2019s largest health insurers, Humana and Cigna, are announcing that they will waive co-pays \u2014 which is a big deal for anybody that understands insurance; they don\u2019t waive co-pays too easily, but we\u2019ve asked them to do it and they\u2019ve done it \u2014 coinsurance and deductibles for the coronavirus treatments to help ease the financial burden on American families during this pandemic. So they\u2019re waiving co -pays, coinsurance, and deductibles. Nobody has \u2014 I don\u2019t think anyone has heard of that one. Have you heard of that one before? I haven\u2019t heard. I want to thank them. Great companies. Today I spoke with Wolfgang Puck. Wolfgang Puck is a great restauranteur, as you know, as is Jean-Georges and Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud, and other leaders in the restaurant business, which has been probably one of the hardest-hit industries. I\u2019ve directed my staff to use any and all authority available to give restaurants, bars, clubs incentives to stay open. You\u2019re going to lose all these restaurants and they\u2019re not going to make it back. They have to get going. So what I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m going to tell Secretary Mnuchin and also our great Secretary of Labor, who you know very well, to immediately start looking into the restoring of the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations that set the restaurant business back a lot when it was done originally, and then done not so long ago. And we\u2019re going to go to deductibility so that companies can send people to restaurants. I think it\u2019ll have a tremendous impact and maybe keep them open. I mean, don\u2019t forget, some are closing right now, despite the fact that they could be open in the not-too-distant future, and we expect that. But there are some that aren\u2019t going to be able to get open, and we want to make sure they do. So we\u2019re going to look at the restoration \u2014 restoring the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations so that corporations can send people to restaurants and take a deduction on it like they did in the old days. That was when restaurants were doing really well. The financial relief bill I signed on Friday provided historic relief for American workers and small businesses, and it includes $350 billion in job restoration and retention. So if you look at job retention loans for small businesses, that\u2019s a big deal, with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying the worker. So it\u2019s $350 billion \u2014 job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying workers. I mean, how about that? Three hundred billion dollars in direct cash payments are being sent to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year; $3,400 for the typical family of four. So they\u2019ll be getting a check for $3,400 for the typical family of four. Approximately $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. Under this plan, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months. The bill provides for these unemployment checks to be delivered through the existing state unemployment systems, not us. State. And I was opposed to this method because many of the states have very antiquated computer systems that are 45 years old, and they\u2019re not prepared to handle this kind of distribution, this kind of money coming in so quickly. They\u2019re not set up for that. And I didn\u2019t want to do it but our opponents wanted it, so we did it. And if they don\u2019t get their money fast, I\u2019m going to ask that we convene the federal government \u2014 that we come back to Congress and we\u2019ll do something where we take care of it, because we can take care of it very easily and quickly \u2014 and I said that. But a lot of these systems, they\u2019re so old and so antiquated at the state level that they\u2019re going to \u2014 they have the money, and they\u2019re going to get the money very quickly, but they\u2019re not going to be able to distribute it. So remember what I said, and we will, if we have to, call Congress back or find some other way of delivery of the money. Throughout this great national struggle, the American people have embodied the unrivaled patriotism and willpower that has led America to conquer every challenge \u2014 every single one in our nation\u2019s history. More than 90 percent of Americans say they\u2019re staying home as much as possible, putting their lives, their careers, their educations, and their dreams on hold out of devotion to their fellow citizens and to their country. Social distancing: That\u2019s the way you win. These shared sacrifices are pulling our nation together like never before. Family bonds are strengthening. Neighbors are looking after neighbors. It\u2019s incredible. I\u2019m seeing, you\u2019re seeing, everybody is seeing what\u2019s happening. Communities are rallying for the cause, and all divisions are fading away. The Americans of every background are uniting to help our nation in this hour of need. It\u2019s up to 151 countries. So when we say \u201cour nation\u201d \u2014 our nation and the world, when you think. Think of it: 151 countries. Somebody said to me today that wasn\u2019t in this particular world \u2014 they didn\u2019t know that we had that many countries. A hundred and fifty-one countries. That\u2019s something. And some are struggling at a level that nobody would have believed possible. If you look at Italy, if you look at \u2014 France is having big problems. Spain is having incredible problems. Something we did very well is, when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level, that was a good thing to do, a great thing to do. We would have had thousands and thousands of more deaths. And we also stopped the inflow from Europe at a very early level. But those things were very important, especially the initial one, because we had never done anything like it, where we closed our borders to a country like that. The modeling put together by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and our other top healthcare ex- \u2014 I mean, we have \u2014 and these people are amazing \u2014 the healthcare experts who, in this country, are the best in the world. They demonstrate that the mitigation measures we are putting in place may significantly reduce the number of new infections and, ultimately, the number of fatalities. I want the American people to know that your selfless, inspiring, and valiant efforts are saving countless lives. You\u2019re making the difference. The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks. So, I\u2019ll say it again: The peak, the highest point of death rates \u2014 remember this \u2014 is likely to hit in two weeks. Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all. Therefore, the next two weeks, and during this period, it\u2019s very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines. Have to follow the guidelines that our great Vice President holds up a lot. He\u2019s holding that up a lot. He believes in it so strongly. The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end. Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30th to slow the spread. On Tuesday, we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings, supporting data, and strategy to the American people. So we\u2019ll be having lots of meetings in between, but we\u2019ll be having a very important statement made on Tuesday \u2014 probably Tuesday evening \u2014 on all of the findings, all of the data, and the reasons we\u2019re doing things the way we\u2019re doing them. We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery. We think, by June 1st, a lot of great things will be happening. I want every citizen in our country to take heart and confidence in the fact that we have the best medical minds in the world tackling this disease. We have the best science, the best researchers, and the best talent anywhere working night and day to protect your family and loved ones and to overcome this pandemic. With the grace of God, we are rising to the occasion. We are proving that no darkness can overshadow the eternal light of American courage. We will win. And when we do, we will rebound with astonishing force and speed. We will be stronger than ever, and we will have learned so much, where something like this can never hurt us to the extent it has \u2014 and the world \u2014 again. In our present crisis, the strength of our people is our single most important asset, and together we will defeat this invisible curse \u2014 this is invisible enemy \u2014 and rise to incredible new heights. So I just want to thank you all for being here. And we\u2019ll take some questions if you\u2019d like. Yeah, please. Kelly. Q Mr. President, Dr. Fauci said that we likely be in excess of a million cases in the United States, and deaths could exceed 100,000. Do you accept that assessment and has that formed your thinking about extending these guidelines? And you also talked about New York. Were you suggesting there has been inappropriate use of masks, or improper conduct with supplies? THE PRESIDENT: No, I want the people of New York to check \u2014 Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio \u2014 that when a hospital that\u2019s getting 10,000 masks goes to 300,000 masks during the same period \u2014 and that\u2019s a rapid period \u2014 I would like them to check that. Because I hear stories like that all the time. You know, we\u2019re develop- \u2014 we\u2019re delivering millions and millions of different products and all we do is hear that, \u201cCan you get some more?\u201d But when you hear that \u2014 and I heard that from one of the great companies of the world at doing this \u2014 it\u2019s a client. And they\u2019re going from \u2014 you heard it \u2014 10,000, 20,000, tops, to 300,000. And that\u2019s a hospital that\u2019s always full. So I think people should check that because there\u2019s something going on, whether \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding; I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out. Check it out. Q (Inaudible.) (Off-mic.) THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I think that\u2019s for other people to figure out. But you don\u2019t go from numbers like that. Now, other equipment likewise, because we\u2019re delivering a lot of ventilators, we\u2019re deve- \u2014 and we\u2019re building. By the way, we\u2019re building and buying, and we have a lot of ventilators that we\u2019re going to be sending out very soon. We also have, right now, in the stockpile, almost 10,000 ventilators that we have to hold in case of emergency. We don\u2019t want them going out and then Louisiana has a tremendous problem, which we now know they do. You know, all of a sudden, it came very quickly. It came \u2014 I mean, Louisiana was doing so fantastically well. Then, all of a sudden, there was a big rash of cases. So, we have to be prepared to move the ventilators. They\u2019re very important pieces of equipment. They\u2019re very expensive and they\u2019re very complex. They\u2019re very \u2014 it\u2019s like building a car. You know, these are expensive, complicated \u2014 very complicated pieces of equipment. So we now have 10,000. And we inherited a system which was broken. Just like \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget the day when a general came and said, \u201cSir\u201d \u2014 my first week in office \u2014 \u201cwe have no ammunition.\u201d That was in the military. We\u2019ve now rebuilt our military stronger than it\u2019s ever been. And we have so much ammunition. You wouldn\u2019t believe it, how much ammunition we have. But the same thing here. We had \u2014 we had a stockpile that was deficient. We had testing that was no good. We had a testing situation that just wasn\u2019t right. It was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken, and it was only good for a very small situation. But what I\u2019d like to do is I\u2019d like to ask Dr. Fauci to come forward and discuss the number, because I think the number \u2014 I think the number is going to be a very different number than the numbers that you talked about. Please, Doctor, you might talk about that. DR. FAUCI: Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, the number I gave out is, you know, based on modeling. And I think it\u2019s entirely conceivable that, if we do not mitigate to the extent that we\u2019re trying to do, that you could reach that number. Q One hundred thousand? DR. FAUCI: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s possible. I mean, you could make a big soundbite about it, but the fact is it\u2019s possible. What we\u2019re trying to do is not let that happen. So instead of concentrating on the upper and the lower, we\u2019re saying that we\u2019re trying to push it all the way down. But the second part of your question was \u2014 yes, we feel that the mitigation that we\u2019re doing right now is having an effect. It\u2019s very difficult to quantitate it because you have two dynamic things going on at the same time: You have the virus going up, and you have the mitigation trying to push it down. But the decision to prolong \u2014 not prolong, but to extend this mitigation process until the end of April, I think, was a wise and prudent decision. Dr. Birx and I spent a considerable amount of time going over all the data, why we felt this was a best choice of us, and the President accepted it. So, in direct answer to your question: The idea that we may have these many cases played a role in our decision in trying to make sure that we don\u2019t do something prematurely and pull back when we should be pushing. THE PRESIDENT: Deborah, please. Would you \u2014 can you explain the 2.2 million, if we did nothing? DR. BIRX: Yeah. THE PRESIDENT: Because a lot of people would like to know that. DR. BIRX: So, thank you. You all know, we\u2019ve all \u2014 you\u2019ve all seen the models. You\u2019ve seen the models from Imperial. You\u2019ve seen the models from Columbia. We\u2019ve reviewed 12 different models. And then we went back to the drawing board over the last week or two, and worked from the ground up, utilizing actual reporting of cases. It\u2019s the way we built the HIV model, the TB model, the malaria model. And when we finished, the other group that was working in parallel \u2014 which we didn\u2019t know about \u2014 HIME [IHME] and Chris Murray ended up at the same numbers. So if you go on his website, you can see the concern that we had, with the gray \u2014 growing number of potential fatalities. All of the flu models predicted anywhere between 1.6 and 2.2 million fatalities, if we didn\u2019t mitigate. I think you all knew those numbers. Some of them predicted half of the United States would get infected and have that level of mortality. So we worked very hard together to really look at all of the impacts of the different mitigations that have been utilized around the world, and used that evidence base to really bring that data and that evidence to the President to consider for extending \u2014 which is not a simple situation when you ask people to stay home for another 30 days. And so they have to know that we\u2019ve really built this on scientific evidence and the potential to save, really, hundreds of thousands of American lives. And we know that\u2019s a huge sacrifice for everyone. We know it\u2019s a sacrifice for every mother and child and father who\u2019s also self-isolating. There are people that have to go out to work, and we know the compromises that they\u2019re making. But it\u2019s all to protect not only Americans, but the healthcare providers \u2014 the healthcare providers that are on the frontlines. And you\u2019ve seen them, and you\u2019ve seen how difficult this has been. And so, we\u2019re really working \u2014 there\u2019ll be a comprehensive piece presented on Tuesday that really talks about not only diagnosing individuals, but also increasing our surveillance now that we have more test kits so that we can really stop and contain new infections. At the same time, we\u2019re really dedicating test kits still to the critical diagnosis so people can get the treatment that they want and so that we can ensure, when people come to the hospital, that they know that the nurses and the doctors and the equipment that they need will be there to serve them. Because together as Americans, we\u2019re going to bring down the number of infections so we don\u2019t have 2.2 million deaths or 1.6 million deaths, but really work very hard to keep this in as low as number as we possibly can. THE PRESIDENT: I just want to reiterate, because a lot of people have been asking, \u201cWell, what would have happened if we did nothing? Did nothing \u2014 we just rode it out.\u201d And I\u2019ve been asking that question to Tony and Deborah, and they\u2019ve been talking to me about it for a long time. Other people have been asking that question. And I think we got our most accurate study today, or certainly most comprehensive. Think of the number: 2.2 \u2014 potentially 2.2 million people if we did nothing. If we didn\u2019t do the distancing, if we didn\u2019t do all of the things that we\u2019re doing. And when you hear those numbers, you start to realize that with the kind of work we went through last week, with the $2.2 trillion, it no longer sounds like a lot, right? So you\u2019re talking about \u2014 when I heard the number today \u2014 first time I\u2019ve heard that number, because I\u2019ve been asking the same question that some people have been asking \u2014 I felt even better about what we did last week with the $2.2 trillion, because you\u2019re talking about a potential of up to 2.2 million. And some people said it could even be higher than that. So you\u2019re talking about 2.2. million deaths \u2014 2.2 million people from this. And so, if we can hold that down, as we\u2019re saying, to 100,000 \u2014 that\u2019s a horrible number \u2014 maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 \u2014 we all, together, have done a very good job. But 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that. I\u2019m feeling very good about what we did last week. Q Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: Yes, please. Go ahead, please. Q Mr. President, given that you\u2019re announcing that you\u2019re extending these guidelines, was floating Easter a mistake, do you think? And \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No. Q \u2014 does this \u2014 can you tell us why and then \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It was just an aspiration. We actually will be hitting, potentially \u2014 and this was with our meeting before \u2014 on Easter, we probably \u2014 they \u2014 well, that could be a peak. That could be a peak period. That could be the peak. Sadly to say, that could be the peak number of deaths before it starts coming down. No, that was aspirational. We had a \u2014 an aspiration of Easter. But when you hear these kind of numbers and you hear the potential travesty, we don\u2019t want to do anything where \u2014 you know, we don\u2019t want to have a spike up. We don\u2019t want to do it soon, and then all of a sudden you go down \u2014 you\u2019re coming down and then you start going up again. Because we discussed that can happen, and we don\u2019t want that to happen. We\u2019ve gone through too much. So that was an aspirational number. I didn\u2019t say \u201cEaster.\u201d I said, \u201cIt would be a great thing, if we could do it by Easter.\u201d And we know much more now that we knew two, three weeks ago. Easter should be the peak number, and it should start coming down, and hopefully very substantially from that point. Q Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Okay? Thank you. Please. OAN. Q Jenn Pellegrino with OAN. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q Thank you, sir. Mr. President, your approval ratings have been the highest they\u2019ve ever been, as well as the ratings on your handling of the virus. Yet, there are some networks that are saying they\u2019re debating whether or not to carry these briefings live. Do you think there\u2019s a link between the two? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t know. I know that \u2014 boy, that\u2019s a nice question. Thank you very much. Yeah, I don\u2019t want high approval ratings for this. I wish we could have our old life back. We had the greatest economy that we\u2019ve ever had, and we didn\u2019t have death. We didn\u2019t have this. We didn\u2019t have this horrible scourge, this plague \u2014 you can call it whatever you want. The virus. But we\u2019re working very hard. That\u2019s all I know. You know, I see things \u2014 I see numbers. They don\u2019t matter to me. What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible. When you hear that 2.2 million people could have died if we didn\u2019t go through all of this, and now the number will be, you know, a much lower number. Hopefully, it\u2019s going to be the numbers that we\u2019re talking about. But \u2014 so I appreciate it very much. But, you know, what I want is I want our life back again. I want our country back. I want the world back. I want the world to get rid of this. This \u2014 again, 151 countries. And we\u2019re going to do it. We\u2019re going to have a great victory. We\u2019re going to have a great victory. Go ahead, please. Q You mentioned it, and I just want to make sure I was right. So, Humana and Cigna are going to waive, for all costs, for anybody that\u2019s got the coronavirus, they\u2019re going to take care of everything? THE PRESIDENT: Well, that\u2019s what they said. I told you what they\u2019re going to take. Q Right. THE PRESIDENT: Co-pays in particular, that\u2019s a big deal. Insurance companies don\u2019t do that, and I appreciate it. Humana and Cigna, they should be getting a lot of credit for that. Q Will there be other companies? Just those two? Or \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know. Well, those two are getting a lot of credit right now for it. And they should, because it\u2019s something that \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of money they\u2019re waiving. And so we thank them. Will there be other companies? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. There\u2019s great \u2014 Q Are you calling on them to do it, sir? THE PRESIDENT: There\u2019s great spirit. I\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 yeah, I\u2019d love to have them do it. Let them waive those co-pays. There\u2019s a great spirit in this country right now. I mean, I know insurance companies better than anybody. They just don\u2019t do that. But now there\u2019s a spirit like I have not seen. I have never seen anything like it. I mean, even the media is much more fair. I wouldn\u2019t say all of it, but that\u2019s okay. They should be fair because they should want this to end. This is \u2014 this is about death. So I want to thank Cigna and Humana. Thank you. Q Will the federal government be reimbursing those insurance companies, or is this something they really are just doing out of their pocketbooks? THE PRESIDENT: They haven\u2019t asked for reimbursement, so I assume they\u2019re not. They said they\u2019re going to waive them. Waiving them doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to waive them and get reimbursed. No. Q Okay. And second question for you, sir. First of the month is three days away. I know these cash payments are coming, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said, today, in about three weeks they should get there. For people that are worried about paying rent \u2014 I know mortgages through HUD is taken care of \u2014 but I\u2019m just curious about rent. What should people be doing for the first of the month? THE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2019re going to be getting the money. I will tell you, I think landlords are going to take it easy. We may put out a statement on that. I think a lot of people that are owed money are going to take it easy. They don\u2019t, sort of, have a choice. But a lot of concessions are made, just like the insurance companies. A lot of concessions are being made that wouldn\u2019t have even been thought of three weeks ago. Not even thought of. So, a lot of really positive things are happening. Please, behind you. Q Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday, why did you publicly threaten a quarantine on New York, New Jersey, parts of Connecticut? THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t do that at all. Read the statement. Read the statement. Read what I said. I said we\u2019re going to look into \u201cpossibly quarantine.\u201d I didn\u2019t say we\u2019re \u201cgoing to quarantine.\u201d I looked at it as a possibility, because a lot of our professionals suggested quarantine. I said we\u2019re going to look at it. We then looked at it. You see? Who are you with? Bloomberg, right? I can\u2019t imagine that. Let me just tell you, I didn\u2019t threaten it. I don\u2019t go around threatening. What happened is, people \u2014 professionals, very good professionals \u2014 love the idea of doing that, because that\u2019s sort of the ultimate in distancing. You can\u2019t do \u2014 they didn\u2019t want New Yorkers, where they\u2019re having a problem, necessarily going down to Florida where they have less of a problem. So the concept of quarantine was thrown out to me. Really, would love to do it \u2014 they would love to do it. And I thought it was too much to do, because the people are doing a great job with it. Also, it\u2019s very hard to enforce. Okay, please. Q But by speaking about it publicly \u2014 I mean, by speaking about it publicly and letting it know \u2014 be known that it\u2019s a consideration, do you think that you maybe frightened some Americans? THE PRESIDENT: No, I think we made people aware to stay in your houses and do good. Now we did an advisory. It\u2019s a strong advisor. The governors are running the advisory \u2014 the three governors: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut. And I think we did a great thing. But all I did yesterday, as you know, and you can see it. You can read it. You can read. And you can see very simply that I said that, \u201cWe are looking into it.\u201d And then before the end of the evening, substantially, we decided to go with the advisory, which frankly, I liked better from the beginning. Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. The first is, you\u2019ve said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don\u2019t actually need. You said New York might need \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say that. Q \u2014 might not need 30,000. THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say that. Q You said it on Sean Hannity\u2019s, Fox News. THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say \u2014 come on. Come on. Q You said that you might \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: You know, why don\u2019t \u2014 why don\u2019t you people act \u2014 let me ask you: Why don\u2019t you act \u2014 Q You said some states \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Why don\u2019t you act in a little more positive? It\u2019s always trying to \u201cget you.\u201d Q My question to you is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: \u201cGet you. Get you.\u201d And you know what? That\u2019s why nobody trusts the media anymore. That\u2019s why people \u2014 Q My question to you is: How is that going to impact \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. You didn\u2019t hear me. That\u2019s why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Look, let me tell you something: Be nice. Don\u2019t be threatening. Q Mr. President, my question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Don\u2019t be threating. Be nice. Go ahead. Q My question is: How is that going to impact how you fill these orders for ventilators or for masks? Your views that \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not going to impact. Q They\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re not going to \u2014 it\u2019s not going to impact you at all? THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re producing tremendous numbers of ventilators. We\u2019re doing a great job on it. Mike Pence, our Vice President, has headed up the task force, which has been incredible, the job they\u2019ve done. We have everybody in the White House working on it. We have \u2014 everybody in the country is working on this in one way or the other. The fact is, we\u2019ve done a great job of delivering. You\u2019ve seen the biggest people in the business \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s nobody even close to this group of people. We had a meeting at 3 o\u2019clock. It lasted for a long time. It was a great meeting with the generals and with everybody else. And they have done a fantastic job. I\u2019m just saying this: If they\u2019re holding \u2014 let me give you one example. We sent thousands of generators to New York. They were put into a warehouse \u2014 a New York warehouse \u2014 that happened to be located, interestingly, in Edison, New Jersey. They were given to New York, and we then went to other places, also giving thousands of ventilators. The people in New York never distributed the generators. We said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you distribute them?\u201d Now, you have to understand, they have New York people working in those warehouses. I knew they had them. So we said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you distribute them?\u201d I\u2019m \u2014 I hope they\u2019ve distributed them now. But maybe they didn\u2019t need them so badly. But just so you know, we\u2019re all \u2014 you, me, everybody \u2014 we\u2019re all on the same team. You know, when \u2014 when journalists get up \u2014 and you\u2019re a journalist, a fine journalist \u2014 Q I was quoting you directly from Sean Hannity THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 when journalists get up and ask questions that are so threatening \u2014 we\u2019re all on the same team. Q I was quoting you directly from your interview with Sean Hannity. THE PRESIDENT: Take a look at my interview. What I want to do is, if there is something wrong, we have to get to the bottom of it. When I hear facemasks go from 10,000 to 300,000, and they constantly need more, and the biggest man in the business is, like, shocked \u2014 he knows all about the virus, by the way; he\u2019s not surprised by that. He knows all about it. He shouldn\u2019t be surprised. He should say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s standard,\u201d because this is, really, a very tough disease. This is, really, a very tough virus to handle. Okay. Please, go ahead. Q Mr. President, my second question \u2014 Mr. President, my second question \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Q My second question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s enough. Thank you very much. Q But, Mr. President, my second question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Please. Please. Q My second question is \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s enough. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s not fair to your other reporters. It\u2019s not fair. You had a long time, a long question. It\u2019s \u2014 if we have time, I\u2019ll get back to you for your second question. Is that okay? Q Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Q Thank you, Mr. President. Just to follow up on previous questions, you said that the peak will hit in two weeks. THE PRESIDENT: Well, we don\u2019t know that, but we think the peak will hit. Q You think it will hit in two weeks. Can \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Right, that is \u2014 Q Sure. THE PRESIDENT: Our two doctors here. Q Can you just share with us your understanding of how bad it will be so the American people will be prepared for it? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can. I think I\u2019ll ask Doctor and Doctor. Maybe you could both come up and give your opinion on that, because that\u2019s really \u2014 Q And I have another question on Italy, please. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Please. DR. BIRX: Thank you. I mean, we have grave concerns when you look at the model. As I told you, look at the Chris Murray model, where he shows rapid escalation. And you can see it happening with the people we\u2019re losing every day throughout the \u2014 throughout America. And you can see it going up, just like cases. And we\u2019re starting to lose people at the same rate. And we have deep concerns about that. And I think we\u2019re meeting, and we\u2019ve had calls with the clinicians. And that has been extraordinarily helpful. I think you\u2019re watching the alerts. And we have a different population than Italy or Spain. And so because of that, our doctors and our nurses are getting information back really quickly so that they can talk to each other about how to really combat this. We\u2019re seeing things here that weren\u2019t reported in other countries. And so, I really want to appreciate \u2014 I know doctors and nurses are going full out, but they\u2019re also taking the time in their two hours of sleep to write us about what could be happening \u2014 when you see the cardiovascular disease and others. So in the model \u2014 and there\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s a large confidence interval, and so it\u2019s anywhere in the model between 80,000 and 160,000, maybe even potentially 200,000 people succumbing to this. That\u2019s with mitigation. In that model, they make full assumption that we continue doing exactly what we\u2019re doing, but even better, in every metro area with a level of intensity. Because we\u2019re hoping that the models are not completely right; that we can do better than what the predictions are. But we\u2019re tracking it very closely, and I think there\u2019s people around the United States really helping us. Scientists across the country have really given freely of their time to really help us not only model this, but really assure that the American public knows how important it is that they stay doing this. You know, you could see from the recent data \u2014 and I\u2019ll have Dr. Fauci talk \u2014 about young people that are being impacted here. We didn\u2019t see that the same way in Europe, but our population is about eight or nine years younger. And so we have to be attentive to all aspects of this \u2014 to children, to young people, to adults. We know, still, the people with preexisting conditions and the elderly are at particularly high risk, but we don\u2019t want to lose any American. And so that\u2019s why I think the President came to the conclusion that, at a minimum, we have to continue what we\u2019ve been doing, but even better. To every metro area out there, we have to do better. We have to ensure that we\u2019re protecting each other. Tony, you want to \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. DR. FAUCI: So, at the risk of offending my modeling colleagues: Models are good, but models often generate the kind of anxious question that you asked, is: \u201cHow bad could this possibly get?\u201d And as I\u2019ve said many, many times, a model is as good as the assumptions that you put into the model. And very often, many of these assumptions are based on a complexity of issues that aren\u2019t necessarily the same, as Dr. Birx said, from one country to the other. So when you give a model, you have the worst extreme, you have the best extreme. Often, the worst extreme means that you don\u2019t do anything. You just, as we say, \u201cLet it rip and let it go.\u201d If you go to the low end, that means you\u2019ve actually mitigated, really, to the utmost. So what I like to do \u2014 as a scientist, a physician, a public health official \u2014 is to not ignore models, but say look at the data as it\u2019s evolving and do everything you possibly can to mitigate that instead of getting overly anxious about the extremes of the model. Again, not to push them aside completely. But the reason the President made the announcement today about going to the end of April is because we want to make sure that we don\u2019t prematurely think we\u2019re doing so great. We may be, but we want to push it to the extreme. So, take that with you and maybe you\u2019ll be less anxious. Okay. Q Mr. President, on behalf of the foreign pool, sir, you mentioned Italy \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Just \u2014 just to finish with \u2014 Q Sure. THE PRESIDENT: So \u2014 so what both were saying, and what Dr. Fauci just brought up, we don\u2019t want to do well and then end a little bit early and have it start going up again, because that would be a disaster. Go ahead, please. Q You mentioned Italy. Italy is a close ally of the United States. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q They\u2019re facing catastrophic time. THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Q They have been receiving help from countries like Russia, China, even Cuba. Cuban doctors have been sent to Italy. Is the United States stepping in to \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we are. Q \u2014 help a close ally like Italy? THE PRESIDENT: In fact, I met last night with our people. We\u2019re sending them a lot of different things that we\u2019re not needing, because we\u2019re obviously in need of a lot also. And we\u2019re also helping them monetarily. We are helping Italy a lot. We\u2019re working very closely with Italy. And we\u2019re working closely with Spain too, which is really hit hard. And we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re working with everybody. I spoke with Angela Merkel the other day; Germany is hit hard. Their mortality rate is different, I think, because they do more testing. But their mortality rate is much different. Italy\u2019s mortality rate is very high, so is Spain. But we\u2019re working very closely with them. Yes, we had a big meeting on it last night. Admiral Giroir, would you please come up and just talk a little bit about the tremendous success that\u2019s been made on testing from where we started? Thank you. ADMIRAL GIROIR: Thank you, Mr. President. So, as of close of business yesterday, we have been able to perform in the United States over 894,000 tests. So, highly significantly increased every single day. Those tests are performed at a number of places: in hospitals in your neighborhood; in the public health laboratories \u2014 the state public health laboratories, and in our territories; as well as the large reference laboratories that are members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association. They have done over 650,000 tests, including over 840,000 just yesterday. I met with all their CEOs yesterday. They\u2019re fully committed to increasing testing to meet the requests and the demands of the President and Vice President. A couple words on the point-of-care test. Point of care means you stop, you get the result right there \u2014 that the President and the Vice President have talked about \u2014 by Abbott, approved in record time by Dr. Steve Hahn and the FDA. This is a point-of-care test, meaning that from the time to swab, to the time you get a positive result: five minutes, like the President said, and at most, 15 minutes for a negative result. So just think of it as a 15-minute test. This is not an esoteric test. There are 18,000 of these little toaster-size machines all over the country, in doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals right now. And Abbott will be providing 50,000, or more, tests per day starting on April 2nd, with the first shipments out already. This complements other point-of-care testing like the Cepheid test that we announced about a week ago. We also have moderate platforms. So it\u2019s not just about the number; it\u2019s the type. We have point of care. We have moderate platforms that are in hospitals and in larger clinics and academic medical centers. And then we have the very large tests. You\u2019ve heard Ambassador Birx talk about the Roche tests and the Roche platforms that are in some of these big reference laboratories. So it\u2019s not just about the number, but it\u2019s about painting this very complex ecosystem so that everybody who needs a test can get a test. On priorities, remember, we are still prioritizing those in most need \u2014 those who are in hospitals or in ICUs \u2014 because that test makes a difference to how they\u2019re being treated. Symptomatic first responders, healthcare workers, and as Administrator Verma will always say, those in long-term care facilities who are at high risk. Two \u2014 one last point: I\u2019ve learned more about nasal swabs than I ever thought I would want to learn in my entire life. But it was a very big thing that the FDA approved last week, and it will now be implemented this week. Instead of having a provider stick this all the way in the back of your nose \u2014 that\u2019s uncomfortable, but it also requires PPE changes every time it\u2019s done \u2014 the FDA approved, with lots of data supporting it, self-swab of your nose. So, literally, put a swab \u2014 a certain kind of swab \u2014 foam swab in your nose, put it in a plastic bag, give it in, and then drop it. This not only increases the speed, but it eliminates all those changes of PPE. So we will be implementing that this week, which will increase speed but also save our precious resources as we build them up in the stockpile and out to hospitals. Thank you, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Admiral, very much. Q Mr. President \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, please go ahead. Q Mr. President, you mentioned that the peak could come in two weeks. Can you ensure that everyone that needs a ventilator \u2014 every single patient that needs one will get one? Will it get there in time? And my second question is: After invoking the Defense Production Act yesterday with GM, you said that there were a couple of problem children that may require using your authority again. What are those companies? And what aren\u2019t they meeting. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t have to tell you because those companies have come into line. They\u2019re doing a great job. They\u2019re working very hard 24 hours, around the clock. So I don\u2019t want to give their names now because they are \u2014 they\u2019ve been great. They\u2019ve come into line. And, by the way, General Motors is doing a fantastic job. I don\u2019t think we have to worry about General Motors now. They\u2019ve really \u2014 they\u2019ve really done a job. And what the Admiral said also \u2014 I think we can add this, Admiral: The reason we show more cases than anybody else in the world is we\u2019re doing more testing than anybody else in the world. So we have more cases because we\u2019re doing far more testing than anybody in the world. And remember, we started with a system that was broken. For many years, it was broken. And I\u2019m not blaming the last administration. I\u2019m saying other administrations. And our pipeline had very little in it. Just like we had no ammunition, we had very little medical; we had very little in our pipeline. Now we have ammunition \u2014 more than hopefully we\u2019ll ever need. And we also have a pipeline that\u2019s packed. And now we have those 10,000 ventilators that we can use because you need some quickly. I mean, this goes quickly from place to place. I\u2019d love to give them all out right now. But we need them quickly. I don\u2019t want to give them out and then we have to take them back and move them someplace else. So we\u2019re very much prepared. Please. Q Mr. President, states like Florida have reportedly had 100 percent of their request for supplies from the National Strategic Stockpile filled, but other states like Massachusetts have not. So how is that assessment being made? And why has Florida gotten its request fulfilled? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think you\u2019re going to find that most \u2014 almost all states \u2014 look, I was on the call yesterday with the governors, and they were happy with the job we\u2019re doing. And I\u2019ll tell you what: If you had a different administration, they would not have been happy. These are people that speak their mind. They were happy. It was falsely reported by a couple of people that, \u201cOh, gee, they weren\u2019t\u201d \u2014 they were happy. They were thrilled. Florida has been taken care of and Michigan has been taken care of \u2014 a very important state. To me, it\u2019s very important because I\u2019m so proud of what we\u2019ve done, bringing car companies back into Michigan. And we\u2019re now dealing with the governor, and I think, Mike, I can say that a lot of good things are happening in Michigan. Massachusetts \u2014 we\u2019re dealing with the governor very strongly and we\u2019re trying to get things to Massachusetts as rapidly as possible. Q But why has Florida received 100 percent of its request compared to some other states? Is there a reason? THE PRESIDENT: Well, Florida \u2014 look, they\u2019re very aggressive in trying to get things, and they\u2019re doing a very good job. But I think \u2014 I think I can say all of the governors are very committed. We\u2019re very committed. We\u2019re working together. And we\u2019re getting things out at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We can \u2014 you can speak to FedEx, you can speak to UPS. You can speak \u2014 they\u2019ve never done anything like this, what they\u2019re doing right now. And nobody in the world has been able to match what these great companies have been able to do. If we left that to government, it would have been a tough thing. We have mobilized private enterprise. We have mobilized the greatest companies in the world. And what\u2019s happening is incredible, and that includes Abbott, where Abbott comes out and, all of a sudden, out of nowhere comes up with this incredible test that simplifies everything and makes it so easy. So I think you\u2019re going to find most states are very happy. I\u2019m dealing with the Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards. He\u2019s a Democrat \u2014 if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at. But I\u2019m dealing with him very successfully. I think he\u2019s very happy. I think he\u2019s actually amazed at what he\u2019s been able to get. In fact, we were even forward thinking. I suggested we send additional ventilators and other things. We\u2019re building a hospital in Louisiana, very importantly. We\u2019re building hospitals in New Jersey. Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a terrific guy and, frankly, he wants \u2014 you know, he\u2019s got a pretty hot spot right there, right next to New York. And we\u2019re doing hospitals. We\u2019re doing ventilators. We\u2019re getting a lot to Governor Murphy; that\u2019s New Jersey. Q So may I ask \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Last night, I spoke to the governor of \u2014 last night, I spoke to the governor of Connecticut. We had a great talk with him. We are really doing a job. Look, Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, he\u2019s been \u2014 he\u2019s been terrific. We sent him a boat way ahead of schedule \u2014 the ship \u2014 way ahead of schedule \u2014 a hospital ship, the Mercy, with 1,000 beds, operating rooms. And it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been in L.A. for three days already. So I think they\u2019re really happy. And when you think about it, in New York, we built 2,900 hospital rooms, beds. Nobody has ever seen it before. The governor has never seen anything like that before. This was done by federal government, not by state government. This was done by the federal government. They\u2019re opening it tomorrow. I wanted to be there so badly but Secret Service and all of the people involved won\u2019t let me. They won\u2019t let me. I would love to be there, but they won\u2019t love me, for obvious reasons. But I would have loved to have been at the opening tomorrow of the hospital in New York, Javits Center \u2014 at Javits Center. But we\u2019re very proud of the job we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve mobilized and getting better and better every day. And the task force, headed by your Vice President, the job they\u2019ve done. And they don\u2019t even sleep. Okay, any other question? Q Sir, may I just follow up on your letter to the governors that you sent? Since we were on the topic of governors. You sent a letter to governors, at the end of the week, saying that you guys are going to be developing criteria \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 to be able to classify counties \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Yeah. Q \u2014 based on whether they were hotspots or what not. And I wanted to know if you have enough tests, currently, to be able to accurately rank those counties. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We\u2019re ranking counties and we\u2019re ranking states. And a lot of people put out false information because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. And we took over a dead, barren system. We took over a system that was obsolete. It was \u2014 it was good for a tiny, little sample of people. It was \u2014 and even that didn\u2019t work, because when CDC first looked at their test, the biggest problem they had is the test didn\u2019t work. That wasn\u2019t from us. That\u2019s been there a long time. Now we have the best tests in the world. And nobody has \u2014 now they\u2019re all calling: \u201cCan we get the quick test?\u201d We call it the \u201cquick test,\u201d where, by the way, probably more accurate and it takes a few minutes. I mean, it\u2019s pretty amazing what we\u2019ve done. No, we\u2019re getting \u2014 we\u2019re getting along great with the governors. Yeah, go ahead. Please. Q Mr. President, sir. Sir \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, go ahead. Please. Q Thank you so much, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, thank you. Q I wanted to ask you more specifically about this strategy that you plan to unveil on Tuesday. What factors are you taking into consideration? What can the American people expect? And is it possible that these April 30th guidelines could be extended? THE PRESIDENT: Well, we hope not. But we think it\u2019s going to \u2014 you know, we have aspirational thoughts. We would have loved to have been a little bit sooner, but we have to do it right. We could have done it. We could have done it on Easter, but there was a good chance that if it\u2019s coming down or if it\u2019s still going up \u2014 maybe it\u2019s going to be coming down by then. But we just felt it was too soon. We can\u2019t take a chance. You know, again, because of what we\u2019ve done and because of the fact that we\u2019ve stopped the flow from China so early \u2014 because the question is, from a lot of my friends, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we just wing it? Why didn\u2019t we just wing it?\u201d And I kept asking, and we did models now. Finally, we got these models in. And you hear about the 2.2 million people would have died. I don\u2019t mean we would have had 2.2 million cases. These are 2.2 million people who would have died. 2.2 million people. Look, we\u2019re going to have a meeting or speech or press conference or something on Tuesday. I thought what I\u2019d \u2014 I was going to announce the end of April on Tuesday, but I said let\u2019s do it now because somewhere along the line it\u2019s going to leak. We might as well just do it now and get rid of all the leaks. This way it did it nice and clean. But we have to really do a great job for another couple of weeks. And I think we\u2019re going to be in great shape. And we\u2019re going to be in a position, even with what we\u2019re trying to do with restaurants, with deductibility \u2014 we have to get these restaurants back in. We have to get our businesses open. We have to get the planes flying. We have to get everything going. We have to get even the cruise ships. I mean, we have to get those cruise ships moving along. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world, three weeks ago, and now we\u2019ve said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t work anymore.\u201d We\u2019re actually paying people not to work. Nobody has ever heard that. That\u2019s not for us. People want to work. But at the same time \u2014 and I\u2019m so glad that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx gave us a number. And the number on the outside \u2014 and maybe it\u2019s not even on the outside; we don\u2019t know \u2014 is 2.2 million people would have died if we didn\u2019t do what we\u2019re doing. And now we\u2019re looking at numbers that are going to be much, much, much lower than that. And it makes everything we\u2019re doing feel much better to me. Please, go ahead. Q Thank you, sir. I do have a question for you, but I\u2019d like to let my colleague, Yamiche, finish her second question, if that\u2019s all right. THE PRESIDENT: That would be fine. Finish it. Go ahead. Q Thanks, Jeremy. THE PRESIDENT: I was going to call on you next. You know that. Q Thank you, Mr. President. You\u2019ve also said that, at one point, that you thought more people might die from the economic tragedies and the economic problems in America due to the coronavirus outbreak. What health officials are telling you that? And, Dr. Fauci, could you speak to that \u2014 the idea that there might be mental health and suicide related to this? Would that outpace, at some point, the virus\u2019s impact on the society? Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I could ask Dr. Fauci to come up, but it\u2019s common sense. You\u2019re going to have massive depression, meaning mental depression. You\u2019re going to have depression in the economy also. But you\u2019re going to have mental depression for people. You\u2019re going to have large numbers of suicides. Take a look at what happens in a really horrible recession, or worse. So you\u2019re going to have tremendous suicides, but you know what you\u2019re going to have more than anything else? Drug addiction. You will see drugs being used like nobody has ever used them before. And people are going to be dying all over the place from drug addiction, because you would have people that had a wonderful job at a restaurant, or even owned a restaurant. I spoke to great people today that have done a great job. And one day, at the top of their business, they\u2019re celebrity chefs, they\u2019ve got the most successful restaurants, and in one day they have nothing. They\u2019ve gotten wiped out. One day, from our enemy: this invisible, horrible scourge. So when you ask me that, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s so easy to figure that. I mean, massive drug use, massive depression \u2014 mental depression, massive numbers of suicide. Anxiety causes, you know, disease, they say. A lot of people \u2014 you\u2019re going to have tremendous. And hopefully we\u2019re not going to have that, because hopefully, by what we\u2019re doing, we get the best of both worlds. We don\u2019t have 2.2 million deaths. We have a number that\u2019s much less \u2014 much, much less. And at the same time, we get our country running again. Please. Thank you very much. Q Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: You were next. He was very nice in doing it, though, nevertheless. Go ahead. Q Thank you, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Which is unusual for CNN. Q Two quick questions. First of all, during this 30-day additional period, do you anticipate at all relaxing those restrictions by region during these additional 30 days, or no? THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s a great question, actually. I don\u2019t think so. And I asked that the same. I said, \u201cHow about Nebraska? How about Idaho? How about Iowa?\u201d And you know what? Those people are so great \u2014 the whole Midwest. They want to \u2014 I don\u2019t think they want to be in that position actually. And probably \u2014 I was given a pretty strong look by these two people. They said, \u201cWe don\u2019t like that idea.\u201d So, you know, we\u2019re relying on them. They\u2019re the best in their profession, and they didn\u2019t like the idea. Q And secondly, sir, I want to ask you about some comment \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: And we could do it, but I don\u2019t think it would be good. Q Thank you, sir. I would also like to ask you about some comments you made on Friday. You were talking about governors of different states, and you said, \u201cI want them to be appreciative.\u201d You also said, \u201cIf they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call.\u201d THE PRESIDENT: But I didn\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t say that. Q These are direct \u2014 direct quotes, sir. THE PRESIDENT: No, it\u2019s such a \u2014 excuse me. Ready? Ready? Ready? Take a look at what I said. I want them to be appreciative of me \u2014 okay? \u2014 and then you cut it off, because it\u2019s fake-news CNN. Q (Inaudible) of you and of your administration. Absolutely. THE PRESIDENT: Listen. Just, please, let me just finish. You just said it again, and you know the answer is a lie. Q I could read you your full comments, sir, if that would be easier. THE PRESIDENT: You know that your statement is a lie. Let me just say \u2014 look, your statement and your response and your answer is a lie, because here\u2019s the story. Are you ready? I said, \u201cI want you to be appreciative of me,\u201d and then you go on, and then I go on, and you cut it off. But it says, because when you\u2019re not \u2014 Q You said, \u201cI want them to be appreciative. I don\u2019t want them to say things that aren\u2019t true. I want them to be appreciative. We\u2019ve done a great job. And I\u2019m not talking about me, I\u2019m talking about Mike Pence, the task force. I\u2019m talking about FEMA\u2026\u201d \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q \u2014 \u201c\u2026and the Army Corps of Engineers.\u201d THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Q But then you went on to say, \u201cIf they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call. He\u2019s a different type of person,\u201d you said \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t call. Q \u2014 referring to the Vice President. THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t call. No, I don\u2019t call the governor of Washington now. Q But why in this time of \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: But Mike Pence calls, and the head of FEMA calls. I don\u2019t stop them. Did I ever ask you to do anything negative, Mike, to Washington, the State of Washington? Michigan \u2014 I love that state. That\u2019s one of my favorite places in the whole world \u2014 Michigan. And I\u2019m so proud of what\u2019s happened with the auto industry; it\u2019s coming back to Michigan. No, I don\u2019t have to call because I\u2019m probably better off not, because we don\u2019t get \u2014 he\u2019s a failed presidential candidate. He\u2019s a nasty person. I don\u2019t like the governor of Washington. So you know who calls? I get Mike Pence to call. I get the head of FEMA to call. I get the Admiral to call. But what you didn\u2019t say \u2014 see, you started it off and you talked about \u201cI have to be appreciated,\u201d but then, when you read the rest, it said: Because if you don\u2019t appreciate, you\u2019re not respecting these incredible people \u2014 the two admirals. You\u2019re not appreciating FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers who built 2,900 beds in three and a half days, and you\u2019re not appreciating all of the work that\u2019s been done, and you\u2019re not appreciating these incredible people from private enterprise that are delivering things in numbers that nobody has ever seen. See, and that\u2019s why people aren\u2019t watching CNN very much anymore. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s why your ratings are no good, because you even \u2014 after knowing the truth for days now, you bring up the old lie. Read the read \u2014 the rest of your question, the rest of your statement, you didn\u2019t put in. You have to put that in. And it said in there \u201cFEMA,\u201d and it said in there \u201cArmy Corps of Engineers.\u201d Because when they disrespect me, they\u2019re disrespecting our government. And you know what? I don\u2019t mind if I\u2019m disrespected, but they can\u2019t disrespect the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. Okay. Please, go ahead. Q Why is the lack of appreciation something that\u2019s important in the midst of (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT: I want them to appreciate the incredible job we\u2019re doing. We are doing a job the likes of which has never been done before. And there are a couple of people that know that, but for political reasons \u2014 let\u2019s say they\u2019re Democrats; they don\u2019t want to give this administration credit, and that\u2019s okay. But I don\u2019t have to deal with them, but our Vice President does deal with them. Please, go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT: But that\u2019s why CNN is not trusted anymore. They are not trusted. They are fake news. Remember that. Go ahead. Q We\u2019re not fake news, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Yes, you are. Go ahead. Q Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about the extension of these CDC guidelines you\u2019ve announced today \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 through the end of next month. And, of course, you know that there have been shelter-in-place orders that have been have been imposed by governors and mayors all throughout the country. And when you take that all into account, it sounds like \u2014 and it seems like you\u2019ve acknowledged \u2014 that America, essentially, will be shut down for the next few weeks, maybe even the next two months; you mentioned June 1st as a date in which you\u2019d like America to \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: No, we think it\u2019s going to really start to open up. We think that that\u2019s going to be the bottom of the hill. That\u2019s where we\u2019re looking at \u2014 June 1st. Maybe even a little bit sooner than that. So we have this hill. If we did nothing, the hill would have been up here. We did a lot. We did just about maximum. And we got lucky, because we stopped China from coming in, and then later on we stopped Europe from \u2014 we got lucky. We got very lucky. The people that were coming in here, they went to Italy, they went to Spain, they went to other countries. We got lucky \u2014 and they got unlucky, to be honest with you. You look at what\u2019s going on in Italy and Spain, in particular. So, no, I don\u2019t want that. June 1st \u2014 we think we can reach the bottom of that hill on June 1st. And that would be a great thing. And I have confidence in the two of \u2014 the two doctors. I think that that could be a day. It could even be sooner. Could be a little bit later; it could be sooner. But I think people would be very happy if we did a job and saved, potentially, millions of lives. I think people would be very happy with that date. Q My question, sir \u2014 I actually asked \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Yes, please. Go ahead, please. Q Sir, Mr. President, my question actually has to do with the 2.2-trillion-dollar relief bill \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 that you signed into law. In your view, do you think that another relief bill, another phase bill may be necessary? And are you prepared to support that, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m prepared to do whatever is necessary to, number one, save lives, and number two, bring our economy back strong just like it was before. I think our economy has a chance to be just as good and even better than it was before. And remember, a lot of the money that you read about, that\u2019s all coming back. These are loans to great companies that got stopped from doing business. They\u2019ll be back very soon. So much of the money that we\u2019re talking about, that money is coming back, and we\u2019ll take warrants \u2014 meaning, we\u2019ll take pieces of the company for the taxpayers of our nation. I expect that we\u2019ll make a lot of money with that money. We\u2019re going to make a lot of money, and that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t even want to talk about making money, because what I want to talk about is two things: Number one is saving lives, and number two is bringing our economy back. Okay? But I think we\u2019re going to do very well. That whole money, a lot of it is coming back. Please. Q Mr. President, thank you. Earlier this afternoon, you tweeted that there are, on average, 8.5 million Americans tuned into these daily press briefings, yet there are some networks out there that are, you know \u2014 I apologize \u2014 THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Q \u2014 concerned about taking these briefings. THE PRESIDENT: No, I know exactly what you\u2019re saying. No, I\u2019ve read that. Q What do you say to these detractors? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019ve read that CNN doesn\u2019t want to cover them. I\u2019ve read that \u2014 except they can\u2019t help them because their ratings are so high. You know, if the ratings were low, they wouldn\u2019t be here. This man wouldn\u2019t be here. In 100 years, you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all their cameras, if they\u2019re bad, because we help their ratings. We help \u2014 we lift up their ratings because their ratings are very low. But for the most part, I haven\u2019t heard that. I will say, the Washington Post has a drive-on not to go to the President of the United States\u2019 news conference \u2014 because, frankly, so many people are watching. We\u2019re getting the word out. We\u2019re getting the accurate word out. And a lot of people are happy about it, and a lot of people aren\u2019t. But they should be happy. When I have the General, when I have Seema, and when I have Tony, and when I have our \u2014 our incred- \u2014 these are, like, people that have become big stars, okay? But they\u2019ve done a great job. But Deborah has done a fantastic \u2014 all of these people. They \u2014 they don\u2019t want to be stars. You know what they want? They want to win. They want to win the battle against the vir- \u2014 they\u2019ve been fighting this stuff their whole life, between Ebola and swine flu and \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d love your life, but that\u2019s what you like, right? That\u2019s what they do: They fight disease. And you know what? There\u2019s nobody that does it better. But I think the American public \u2014 ultimately, they should be the decider. It\u2019s like if they don\u2019t want to watch, they shouldn\u2019t watch. And we shouldn\u2019t have bigger ratings than \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d or, as the New York Times said, we have Monday Night Football-type ratings. Now, I didn\u2019t say that. I have no idea what they are, in a sense, but I know that the Times, they say it\u2019s all the news that\u2019s fit to print. I say it\u2019s all the news that\u2019s not fit to print because I think they are not honest people, but that\u2019s okay. But they can\u2019t help it. But even they said that the ratings are like Monday Night Football ratings, and that these are like \u201cBachelor\u201d finale \u2014 that\u2019s their end. When the big deal happened \u2014 I have no idea what happened because I\u2019m too busy working on this. Someday you will tell me what happened. So, no, I think it\u2019s terrible. When they don\u2019t want the President of the United States to have a voice, you\u2019re not talking about democracy any longer. Please. Thank you very much. Q Thanks, Mr. President. You\u2019ve talked a lot about concerns about leaving the economy shut down for so long. Was there any dissent from your top economic advisors in your decision to leave the guidelines in place until the end of April? THE PRESIDENT: No. No. And this is before we heard the 2.2 million people. I mean, we had a lot of people who were saying, \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t do anything. Just ride it.\u201d They say, \u201cRide it like a cowboy. Just ride it. Ride that sucker right through.\u201d That\u2019s where the 2.2 million people come in, who would have died, maybe. But it would have been 1.6 to 2.2. And that\u2019s not acceptable. But there were a lot of people that said \u2014 I thought about it. I said, \u201cMaybe we should ride it through.\u201d You know, you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We\u2019re in the midst of a bad flu season. You know, we had a bad season last year as an example. A bad flu season. And you\u2019ll have 35-, 36-, 37,000 people die, sometimes more, sometimes less. But this is different. And part of this is the unknown, and part of it also is the viciousness of it. I had a friend who went to a hospital the other day. He\u2019s a little older, and he\u2019s heavy, but he\u2019s tough person. And he went to the hospital, and a day later, he\u2019s in a coma. I call: \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d \u201cSir, he\u2019s in a coma. He\u2019s unconscious.\u201d He\u2019s not doing well. The speed and the viciousness, especially if it gets the right person, it\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s really horrible. Please, go ahead. Q Mr. President, this may be good for some of the advisors as well. We\u2019ve heard some rumors that Louisiana is really going to get hit hard next because there\u2019s a possibility with Mardi Gras. Have you guys seen any data to back that up, of what happened a few weeks ago, and whether or not that\u2019s contributing to the spike in Louisiana? THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rumor. I think it\u2019s a fact. Louisiana has been hit hard. And Louisiana, as an example, it started off with like nobody for so long. I spoke \u2014 when I spoke to the governor. But Deborah or Tony? Any \u2014 either of you, if you\u2019d like to talk. DR. BIRX: You know, I think you heard us talk, about a week ago, that we were very worried about the numbers and how they were increasing in Louisiana, how they were increasing in Cook County, how they were increasing in Dearborn and Detroit. And I think those are areas that we\u2019re still watching very carefully. And like the President said, when people get this virus, some people do very poorly. And when certain metro areas get exposed to the virus, we see this really very rapid expansion of the virus. We think it may have been circulating there for, you know, a couple of weeks. We don\u2019t like to \u2014 I don\u2019t like to look backwards; I only like to look forwards. And, really, we are putting all of our effort into ensuring that the people of New Orleans, the people of the Detroit region \u2014 frankly, the people of New York. I mean, some of the fastest-growing counties are not New York itself, New York City, when you look at a per hundred thousand; it\u2019s Rockland, it\u2019s Bergen. So, I mean, these are \u2014 all of these places are people that have transited through cities, and that\u2019s why we really did want the travel advisory, just to really warn people to watch out for their own health, to really take their temperatures. And so it can go from 50, 100, 500 cases, and the next thing you know, it\u2019s 2,000, it\u2019s 4,000, it\u2019s 10,000. And because it then gets across all communities, people get very sick. DR. FAUCI: You know, you made the comment about New Orleans. This can happen anywhere, and that\u2019s really one of the issues that we\u2019re concerned about and why we were so reluctant to pull back at a time when we need to put our foot on the gas, as opposed to on the brake. And as Dr. Birx said, this is exactly what you see. There are a number of communities, cities, states, what have you, out there, in which they\u2019re trickling along like that. Don\u2019t get complacent about that because that\u2019s exactly the way the virus works. It goes like this, and then like this, and then it goes up like that. That\u2019s exactly what happened in New Orleans. That\u2019s what happened, in a terrible way, with New York. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to avoid in multiple locations throughout the country. So we shouldn\u2019t take any solace when we see low levels in different states, different cities, different areas, because they\u2019re very vulnerable to an explosion. Q And, Mr. President, last question from me, sir. I \u2014 just real quick. I asked the Vice President a week ago, and I think we talked about it last week as well. You took the test that first time. I remember that. And I think you took it last week, Mr. Vice President. Have you had a chance to take it again? Does it get easier the second time around? Does it \u2014 how are you feeling? THE PRESIDENT: Well, I haven\u2019t. I think I\u2019m waiting for that little 45-minute test. I sort of like that. Or now it\u2019s down to five minutes, I understand. But, no, I haven\u2019t. But I think I\u2019ll \u2014 I think I will take it again, if it\u2019s appropriate. I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s any symptoms. I don\u2019t notice \u2014 have you noticed any sniffles? Nothing, right? So far, I haven\u2019t felt that way. But, you know, there was a big, strong point made originally, and I think it still holds: Take the test if you need it, if you have the symptoms. If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t take it. That\u2019s put out by the professionals. So, you know, I don\u2019t have it. But I would \u2014 I would take it. I just wanted to say one thing also about what Tony had mentioned. So I grew up in Queens, New York, and right next to a place called Elmhurst, Queens. And they have a hospital that\u2019s a very good hospital \u2014 Elmhurst Hospital. Right? I\u2019ve known it. I\u2019ve known where it is. I can tell you the color on the outside, the size of the windows. I mean, I know it very well, right? That was near my community where I lived. And I\u2019ve been watching that for the last week on television. Body bags all over in hallways. I\u2019ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks \u2014 freezer trucks; they\u2019re freezer trucks \u2014 because they can\u2019t handle the bodies there\u2019s so many of them. This is in my \u2014 essentially, in my community in Queens \u2014 Queens, New York. I\u2019ve seen things that I\u2019ve never seen before. I mean, I\u2019ve seen them, but I\u2019ve seen them on television in faraway lands. I\u2019ve never seen them in our country. Elmhurst Hospital \u2014 unbelievable people. I mean, I \u2014 when I see the trucks pull up to take out bodies \u2014 and these are trucks that are as long as the Rose Garden. And they\u2019re pulling up to take out bodies, and you look inside and you see the black body bags. You say, \u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d It\u2019s Elmhurst Hospital; must be supplies. It\u2019s not supplies. It\u2019s people. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. So, we\u2019re doing \u2014 these people are doing a fantastic job. And somebody else who\u2019s doing a fantastic job is sitting here, who is the head of the task force. And I just maybe want to finish off because I\u2019d like to ask Mike \u2014 what do you think about what we\u2019ve done and where do you think we\u2019re going? And how do you feel also \u2014 and you\u2019ve studied this so closely \u2014 how do you feel about the curve and the June 1st date? And that\u2019s a very \u2014 that\u2019s aspirational. But I think that\u2019s, really, modified aspirational, because I think we\u2019re going to hit it. And maybe we\u2019ll even beat it. Okay, Mike? Please. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. And let me just join you in thanking the American people for the efforts that the people of this nation have made over the past 15 days and that we know they will continue to make over the next 30. You heard the President speak today about the modeling. And on Tuesday, he will share with the nation the full range of counsel, of the team that he assembled now months ago at the White House Coronavirus Task Force, will lay out to the country what could have been, but what we\u2019re continuing to work to make a reality. But in the meantime, every American \u2014 I think every American should have a grateful heart, first and foremost, to all the incredible healthcare workers that are on the front lines at places like Elmhurst and elsewhere every single day, as Dr. Birx said, getting just a few hours of sleep and going right back into work. I mean, they are the hands and feet of American compassion. And I want to say on behalf of your President, and on behalf of a grateful nation, that we\u2019re with you. We\u2019re going to continue to work tirelessly with these outstanding leaders at FEMA to make sure that you have the protective equipment to be able to do your job safely and go home to your family. We\u2019re going to continue to work with these incredible distributors. Literally, the aircraft that landed at JFK this morning is the first of 51 aircraft that are going to be coming in from around the world, and it\u2019s all headed to support our healthcare workers and people that are on the frontlines. But also, Mr. President, I want to say thank you to American businesses whose generosity is shining forth every day. The two insurance companies that you mentioned have waived co-pays and are providing full coronavirus coverage to Americans for the full treatment that people that are enduring this virus are experiencing. But American businesses, like those so well represented here, are stepping up every day with what the President likes to call a \u201cspirit,\u201d the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen for quite a while in this country. And it\u2019s truly inspiring. I also want to join your words about this team that you\u2019ve assembled \u2014 not only the healthcare team, the extraordinary team at FEMA and HHS, but all of our partners at the state and local level, the work that they\u2019re doing. And, Mr. President, when you tapped me to do this five weeks ago, you said: I want a full partnership with our states. I want to \u2014 I want to make sure the federal government is there working \u2014 working with our governors and all the local health officials. And to all of you who are managing your states, to all of you that are implementing those healthcare policies on the local level, you have our admiration and our commitment to continue to be with you. I think what the President laid out today, while it is \u2014 I\u2019m sure for many Americans that were hoping we would be with this sooner, there may be a modest sense of frustration and disappointment. But what I hear, speaking to these healthcare experts, is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. And that as the American people continue to put into practice the President\u2019s Coronavirus Guidelines for America \u2014 as each one of us continues to do our part \u2014 social distancing, avoiding groups of more than 10, using a drive-through at local restaurants, avoiding unnecessary travel \u2014 as every American continues to listen to your state and local leaders to heed that domestic travel advisory that the CDC issued on Saturday night, we\u2019re going to hasten the day that we get to the other side of this, as the President said. And that we truly do believe that while there are challenges in the weeks ahead, there is hope that as every American continues to put these guidelines into practice, as every single one of us continues to do our part, that we\u2019ll get through this. I mean, when the American people know the how tall the hill is, Mr. President, we\u2019ve never failed to get over it and then some. And I think with your leadership, with this extraordinary team that you\u2019ve assembled, with the great leadership that we have at the state and local levels, with the partnership with American businesses, and that can-do spirit of the American people, we\u2019ll get through this, and we\u2019ll get through this together. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much, Mike. So I just want to end by saying that we\u2019re all in this together, all of us. I have never seen anything like it. The unity, the esprit de corps, the spirit \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to watch. Unfortunately, the enemy is death. It\u2019s death. A lot of people are dying, so it\u2019s very unpleasant. It\u2019s a very unpleasant thing to go through. But the level of competence, the level of caring, the level of love, I \u2014 I just think it\u2019s brilliant, and it\u2019s possibly happening in other countries. Possibly. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t speak to other countries, but I can speak to the United States of America. And I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: I am very proud to be your President. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. END 7:13 P.M. EDT",

In part one of a two-part interview with Professor Martin Bachmann, the expert immunologist spoke with Medical News Today about his vaccine, what life is like in his lab at the moment, and how he thinks the pandemic will unfold. Share on Pinterest Prof. Martin Bachmann speaking at the World Immune Regulation Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in 2019. Image credit: Ojoer, 2019. While many of us are settling into our new found reality of social distancing and self-isolation to slow down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, researchers across the globe are busy working on new vaccines and treatments. Leading immunologist Martin Bachmann is both a professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom and the Head of the Department of Immunology at the University of Bern in Switzerland. Medical News Today spoke with Professor Bachmann about the COVID-19 pandemic and the work he is doing on his candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. He hopes to produce enough of the vaccine to treat part of the world\u2019s population in 6\u20138 months. Virus-like particles MNT: What are the challenges that researchers face when they work on a new vaccine during a pandemic compared to working during normal times? Prof. Martin Bachmann: Well, it\u2019s mostly the timeline that is so totally different. It just needs to be much faster. Normally, when we work on a virus vaccine, we have everything we need in place, the virus, the models to challenge, and how well the vaccine works. It\u2019s challenging now because we haven\u2019t had the time to build up the samples, get the virus, or spend time developing the best models to use. MNT: Your vaccine uses a different approach to what we\u2019ve seen from other labs and companies. Can you explain how your vaccine works? Prof. Martin Bachmann: We use so-called virus-like particles that are not infectious. These are self-assembling structures that look like a virus, but they don\u2019t have any genetic information. If you express a coat protein of a virus, it often self-assembles into a virus-like structure. The vaccine for human papillomavirus, for example, is a virus-like particle vaccine. It is very well known that virus-like particles are very immunogenic. In particular, they make very good antibody responses, B cell responses to be precise. And this is what you want. If you make a vaccine against a virus, and if you hope it works, you have to have neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies are the key to any vaccine on the market that fights viruses. The new coronavirus uses a Spike protein to attach to a receptor on a cell, and that allows infection with the virus. The receptor is called ACE2. We are working with a part of the Spike protein, called the receptor-binding domain (RBD). This part of the Spike protein is responsible for binding to ACE2. For SARS and MERS, most neutralizing antibodies are directed against the RBD domain of the Spike protein. When we use this RBD domain in isolation, it\u2019s not very immunogenic. To improve this, we used the RBD domain, and chemically linked it to the virus-like particle. And now, the immune system thinks that the RBD domain attached to the virus-like particle is a virus because it looks like a virus and correspondingly makes a very strong immune response. And this is the basis of many vaccines we\u2019re developing, for example, against peanut allergy. Testing the vaccine and making enough Prof. Martin Bachmann: We have done a number of experiments to test the Spike protein RBD domain virus-like particle. We used our vaccine in mice, and on the one hand, we have seen that it blocks the binding of the Spike protein to the ACE2 receptor. We have also done what is called neutralization assays, where we measure the amount of neutralizing antibody produced after vaccination. If we vaccinate just with the RBD domain, we don\u2019t see a lot of neutralizing antibodies. However, if we vaccinate with the RBD domain on the virus-like particle, we see a lot of neutralizing antibodies. We then tested the neutralizing antibodies on a lab-made version of the new coronavirus, where we took the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and attached it to a model virus to test if the neutralizing antibodies work. Our collaborators in China carried out these experiments during the complete shutdown, and they saw that this works. At the moment, we have a way of using chemical coupling to attach the RBD domain to the virus-like particle, and we know this works. But there is an issue with scale. If you want to make 5 billion doses of this in a few months, you would be hard pressed to do that. We are now working on an important modification. We are trying to genetically fuse the RBD domain into the surface of the virus-like particle. We have two different virus-like particles that we are testing for this, from the cucumber mosaic virus and a virus called AP205. \u201cIf this works, then we expect to make around 10,000 doses with 1 liter (l) of culture, which means you can really make a lot of doses in a short period of time.\u201d We know the chemically coupled version of the vaccine works very well, but we would not be able to make a lot of this in a short period. We could make this for specific target groups, maybe hospital staff. But with the genetically fused vaccine, we could make a lot in a short time. However, this needs a lot of commitment and compromises by the health authorities. Clinical studies during a pandemic MNT: When you are working on a new vaccine during a pandemic, which steps in the normal development process do you think you will have to skip, and what challenges does that present to you and health authorities? How are you working with them to overcome these barriers? Prof. Martin Bachmann: We are only at the start of our conversations with health authorities now, as we\u2019ve been working on generating the data so far. You have to focus on safety, of course. You need to be sure that you don\u2019t harm anyone. But, if the vaccine is pure, and it\u2019s easy to determine whether or not it\u2019s pure, then actually its chance to cause harm is minimal because it doesn\u2019t replicate. It\u2019s not like an attenuated virus, which, if given to an immunocompromised person, has the potential to make them sick. \u201cSo what I would like to do is an initial study, maybe on 100 people, just to see that you get the right antibodies and that people tolerate it reasonably well. Then you can expand. That would involve constant monitoring of course by the health authorities, but then really, you could give the vaccine to everyone.\u201d At the same time, we could work on improvements. For example, we are looking at making the vaccine even more efficient by adding adjuvants, such as microcrystalline tyrosine. MNT: What data do you have from your previous work to show that the virus-like particles that you are using are safe to give to people? Prof. Martin Bachmann: We have done a lot of studies. We have not tested this particular virus-like particle in humans, but we have tested it in numerous animals, including cats, dogs, and horses, and they have always tolerated it well. MNT: How difficult will it be to do your initial studies during a time of pandemic. Who would you test your vaccine on first? Prof. Martin Bachmann: If you want to determine efficacy, you would start with at risk people, for example, hospital staff, because you would need to have a sufficient number of people at risk of getting sick by being exposed to the virus. But this could all be done as part of one big study. Of course, you don\u2019t want to immunize people to then find out your vaccine doesn\u2019t work. But testing the first group of people could already be part of a bigger study, with milestones that we would need to pass before expanding the number of people. Well, that is my idea, at least.",

                              "text": "Updated at 2:47 p.m. ET on May 28, 2020. By all estimates, the novel coronavirus is quickly becoming the most disruptive pandemic in more than a century. New developments and warnings are being issued every day. The uncertainty of this moment has also led to abundant misinformation, some coming from the president himself. As you sort through the onslaught, here are some stories to help you make sense of life during a pandemic. The Atlantic is choosing to make these freely available to all readers, even those who don\u2019t subscribe. This list will be updated with our continuing coverage. We Don\u2019t Even Have a COVID-19 Vaccine, and Yet the Conspiracies Are Here, by Sarah Zhang Mistrust of and misinformation about vaccines runs deep in the United States. Though experts hope that widespread fear of falling ill or spreading disease during a global pandemic will be enough to convince skeptics that they\u2019re better off receiving an eventual vaccine, anti-vaccine messaging and existing coronavirus conspiracies could make such cooperation unlikely. And the Trump administration\u2019s inconsistent and faulty statements about public health and vaccine development will only make it more difficult for the scientific community to gain the public\u2019s trust. Zhang lays out several important variables that could affect how receptive America is to a COVID-19 vaccine, including factors as unpredictable as timing: The vaccine\u2019s timing could affect its reception too. Heidi Larson, whose Vaccine Confidence Project has been regularly surveying people in Europe throughout the pandemic, says the numbers have changed slightly over time: In mid-March, 7 percent said they would refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine, which dropped to 5 percent two weeks later, when COVID-19 deaths spiked, and rose to 9 percent when talk turned to loosening lockdowns. \u201cThe public is in general pretty sensible in how they make their decision, and they are weighing their different perceived risks or benefits,\u201d she says. If the pandemic seems as if it\u2019s waning, fewer will be willing to take a chance on a new vaccine. Is Everyone Depressed? by James Hamblin Many of the classic signs of depression\u2014lethargy, social withdrawal, disinterest in activities\u2014suddenly seem like nearly unavoidable side effects of Americans\u2019 daily routines. The coronavirus has rapidly worsened the mental-health crisis in the U.S. At the same time, it\u2019s also made discerning whether depressive feelings are circumstantial or indicative of underlying disorders more difficult. Identifying clinical depression and doling out treatment appropriately is difficult in person, and even harder over video calls. In the absence of methods to easily pinpoint who needs treatment most urgently, ensuring that mental-health resources match the scale of those who need them for any reason could be a better plan. Just as, in the time of COVID-19, not everyone with a cough can go to the hospital, clinicians are working to identify and prioritize those who truly need in-person mental-health attention. Jennifer Rapke, the head of inpatient consultation at Upstate Golisano Children\u2019s Hospital in New York, has seen a surge in teenagers reporting suicidal ideation and instances of self-harm, so she has been carefully turning away the less severe cases to make sure that inpatient facilities aren\u2019t overwhelmed. \u201cWe\u2019re only seeing people who absolutely need to be here,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, those with milder, emerging cases are sometimes left in limbo. \u201cThe places we would normally send people, the things we would put in place to address the depression or the anxiety in early phases\u2014they don\u2019t exist or they\u2019re unavailable,\u201d Rapke says. Social Distancing Is Not Enough, by Derek Thompson As parts of America slowly begin to reopen, we\u2019re starting to get a sense of what it might take to return to shared indoor spaces. Activities will return, but in altered forms to keep people safe in the great indoors. Sports events could open with limited seating, zero concessions, and staggered admission times. Restaurants might ask customers to order online before arriving. And between-desk barriers could become ubiquitous, along with a slew of other workplace precautions: Office meetings, once merely obnoxious, are deemed simply noxious. The South Korean government devotes a full page and 12 bullet points to the subject of meetings, but those recommendations can be boiled down to three words that will make meeting-haters rejoice: fewer, smaller, shorter. For meetings that are necessary, large, and long, South Korea recommends masks for all participants and, if possible, open windows. Ventilation, in general, will become a watchword. Many offices may have to overhaul their vent technology or hire professionals to improve airflow throughout the entire office. \u201cHow Could the CDC Make That Mistake?\u201d, by Alexis C. Madrigal and Robinson Meyer The CDC began releasing nationwide coronavirus testing data in mid-May with little fanfare. But when the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic compared the data with numbers put out by individual states, our reporters found dramatic inaccuracies in the agency\u2019s figures, including a complete failure to distinguish at all between viral and antibody tests. That makes the CDC\u2019s testing numbers virtually useless for any attempts at containing the virus. Viral tests, taken by nose swab or saliva sample, look for direct evidence of a coronavirus infection. They are considered the gold standard for diagnosing someone with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus: State governments consider a positive viral test to be the only way to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antibody tests, by contrast, use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past. A negative test result means something different for each test. If somebody tests negative on a viral test, a doctor can be relatively confident that they are not sick right now; if somebody tests negative on an antibody test, they have probably never been infected with or exposed to the coronavirus. (Or they may have been given a false result\u2014antibody tests are notoriously less accurate on an individual level than viral tests.) The problem is that the CDC is clumping negative results from both tests together in its public reporting. America\u2019s Patchwork Pandemic Is Fraying Even Further, by Ed Yong Ed Yong\u2019s fourth deep look at the country\u2019s crisis reveals how federal failures created a dangerous patchwork of viral spread with little oversight. Different cities and rural areas that may think they\u2019ve evaded the virus could still become the next hot spots, he writes. And nearly every feature of the virus helps enable this uneven and staggered movement. Even the spread from person to person can be unpredictable: Consider \u201csuper-spreader events,\u201d in which dozens or hundreds of new infections stemming from a single person create entirely new branches of the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a hurricane or some other disaster that will come and go, signaling an obvious moment when recovery can begin. It is not like the epidemics of fiction, which get worse until, after some medical breakthrough, they get better. It is messier, patchier, and thus harder to predict, control, or understand. \u201cWe\u2019re in that zone that we don\u2019t see movies made about,\u201d says Lindsay Wiley, a professor of public-health law at American University. Why the Coronavirus Hits Kids and Adults So Differently, by Sarah Zhang On the whole, common infectious diseases tend to be most dangerous to children. But coronaviruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, are rarer, and have tended to largely spare children. That might be because, as we age, the variety within our infection-fighting T cells decreases in favor of strengthening our defenses against the illnesses we encounter most. Adults\u2019 immune systems are more practiced at identifying and disarming common infectious agents, while a younger immune system might be better equipped to defend against an obscure intruder. The two human viruses most closely related to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 are the ones behind SARS and MERS\u2014both also coronaviruses, a large family that infects many animal species. SARS likely jumped from bats to civet cats to humans in 2002, and MERS from camels to humans in 2012. Both have a much higher fatality rate than COVID-19 and neither exploded into a pandemic on the current scale, giving us smaller numbers from which to draw conclusions. Still, they too seemed to have largely spared children. Like COVID-19, SARS and MERS were caused by viruses entirely new to humans, and adult immune systems are unused to dealing with entirely new viruses. By and large, the ones that sicken adults year after year are altered versions of viruses they\u2019ve encountered before, such as seasonal flu. Children, on the other hand, are constantly dealing with viruses that are not necessarily novel but are novel to them. \u201cEverything an infant sees, or a young child sees, is new,\u201d says Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University. Thus, their immune system is primed to fight new pathogens in a number of ways. You\u2019ll Probably Never Know If You Had the Coronavirus in January, by Rachel Gutman Many Americans are eager to know whether that lingering cough or punishing fever they had back in the winter was in fact COVID-19. The official tally of coronavirus cases in January is certainly an undercount, but all the available evidence suggests that the number of infections in the U.S. that month was still very, very small. Coming up with a precise number will require data about travel, deaths, and blood tests that are currently unavailable or unreliable. It\u2019s possible we\u2019ll arrive at an answer, but even if we do, it will be all but impossible to identify the specific people who were infected. Unfortunately, experts generally agree that the actual number of Americans carrying the virus by the end of January was nowhere near high enough to support speculation about herd immunity and star-studded superspreader events. Beyond that, the estimates vary widely. Lauren Gardner, an associate professor of engineering at Johns Hopkins University, who created the school\u2019s popular dashboard for tracking coronavirus cases, told me that \u201cthere could have been hundreds of cases in the U.S. in January and thousands by the end of February.\u201d Trevor Bedford, a biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who has been at the forefront of the genetic study of SARS-CoV-2, says that \u201cmore than 10, less than 100 would be my guess.\u201d Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me that she\u2019s \u201cconfident it is not zero\u201d and that \u201cit seems like it\u2019s not millions.\u201d The Problem With Stories About Dangerous Coronavirus Mutations, by Ed Yong In recent weeks, a popular claim that multiple strains of the coronavirus could be spreading in tandem has sparked fear of a double pandemic, one tamer and one deadly. There is in fact no scientific evidence for this claim, and researchers agree that only one recognizable strain of the virus has surfaced thus far. While small mutations have likely occurred, none have produced especially distinct\u2014or deadly\u2014lineages of the virus. As an epidemic progresses, the virus family tree grows new branches and twigs\u2014new lineages that are characterized by differing sets of mutations. But a new lineage doesn\u2019t automatically count as a new strain. That term is usually reserved for a lineage that differs from its fellow viruses in significant ways. It might vary in how easily it spreads (transmissibility), its ability to cause disease (virulence), whether it is recognized by the immune system in the same way (antigenicity), or how vulnerable it is to medications (resistance). Some mutations affect these properties. Most do not, and are either silent or cosmetic. \u201cNot every mutation creates a different strain,\u201d says Grubaugh. (Think about dog breeds as equivalents of strains: A corgi is clearly different from a Great Dane, but a black-haired corgi is functionally the same as a brown-haired one, and wouldn\u2019t count as a separate breed.) Food Banks Can\u2019t Go On Like This, by Conor Friedersdorf Even before the pandemic, changes to the food supply chain and food assistance policies had driven up costs and complications for food banks. As economic collapse drives more and more Americans to food banks, donations of \u201crescued\u201d food (think a coffeeshop offloading pastries at the end of the day) have simultaneously dried up. And communities across the country are facing varied challenges in connecting people in need with support systems. Friedersdorf argues that local food banks and those who rely on them should be permitted to bypass some of the hoops they\u2019ve been forced to jump through to ensure everyone gets fed during the pandemic. Facing Hunger Foodbank in West Virginia used to serve about 129,000 people on a typical day. Its executive director, Cynthia D. Kirkhart, witnessed the same sharp rise in demand after her state issued its stay-at-home order. Then the retail donations that the food bank receives from partners such as Walmart and Kroger shrank by roughly 90 percent, and delivery times for purchased food grew from a week to eight or 10 weeks. \u201cBetween March 30 and April 8, I placed orders in excess of $487,000 for food, and some of it won\u2019t be arriving until late June, but at least I\u2019ll have a regular influx coming in,\u201d she told me. \u201cMy total budget for this year was about $500,000. My reworked budget is going to look more like $1.2 million to $1.5 million, and that\u2019s with an optimistic outlook for what happens with this pandemic and how long we are in recovery.\u201d What\u2019s Behind South Korea\u2019s COVID-19 Exceptionalism? by Derek Thompson South Korea beat the coronavirus by design, not because of millennia-old cultural values. A brush with MERS less than a decade ago inspired the country\u2019s government to revamp and fortify its public-health planning and infrastructure. As a result, thanks to free testing, detailed tracing, and mandatory isolation, South Korea was able to effectively contain the spread of the coronavirus within weeks\u2014something no other large democracy has done as successfully. \u201cTest, trace, and isolate\u201d is the three-legged stool of South Korean public-health policy. But what keeps the stool upright is the shared confidence between the government and the public. \u201cA delicate balance of trust \u2026 drives the entire thing,\u201d the writer Yung in Chae told me. People trust the government in part because it works to keep raw politics out of public health. South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Health has for months held daily briefings to update the public and convey best practices, such as social distancing and hand-washing. And the government trusts the public to act as a responsible co-partner in public health. Rather than announcing an official lockdown that would fully close restaurants and businesses and force citizens to stay home, the Korean government has opted to keep more of its economy open. \u201cWe were never on lockdown, and we\u2019re still not on lockdown,\u201d Paul Choi, a consultant who lives in Seoul, told me. \u201cBut citizens have taken it upon ourselves to stay inside. We\u2019re very careful to wash our hands and keep our distance. Almost everybody is wearing masks. If you don\u2019t wear masks, you get looks on the street.\u201d Should You Get an Antibody Test? By James Hamblin Antibody tests have been touted as one of the key tools that will eventually allow people to freely interact with their communities again. But what do these blood tests actually measure, and who (if anyone) should be seeking them out right now? James Hamblin, an Atlantic staff writer and a medical doctor, assembled a basic FAQ of everything you need to know about how your immune system responds to the coronavirus and the current uses of antibody tests. One question he addresses is why antibody testing is receiving so much attention: Right now, the antibody tests are being used to help map out where the coronavirus has spread, like tracking the footprints it has left. Combined with other types of research, this information will eventually help identify who is most susceptible to infection, and why. Even if we can\u2019t tell individuals that they are totally protected, we could theoretically begin to allocate scarce resources away from a city where 50 percent of people have antibodies to one where only 5 percent of people do. Georgia\u2019s Experiment in Human Sacrifice, by Amanda Mull Georgia\u2019s decision to reopen businesses against the advice of public-health experts will kill people, so why is the state proceeding? The decision was made by a state leadership that values its economy over human life, Mull argues. Ultimately, Georgia will end up serving as the country\u2019s canary in the coal mine. The state\u2019s business owners are aware of the role they\u2019re playing, and some aren\u2019t happy about it. Many Georgians have no delusions about the risks of reopening, even if they need to return to work for financial reasons. Among the dozen local leaders, business owners, and workers I spoke with for this article, all said they know some people who disagreed with the lockdown but were complying nonetheless. No one reported serious acrimony in their communities. Instead, their stories depict a struggle between a state government and ordinary people. Georgia\u2019s brash reopening puts much of the state\u2019s working class in an impossible bind: risk death at work, or risk ruining yourself financially at home. In the grips of a pandemic, the approach is a morbid experiment in just how far states can push their people. Why the Coronavirus is so Confusing, by Ed Yong Even to researchers, much about how the coronavirus operates and spreads is still a mystery. But that\u2019s not cause for alarm: It\u2019s just how the scientific process works. Yong breaks down each of the factors that experts need to investigate\u2014including the disease itself, the public-health messaging, and the flurry of statistics\u2014before the coronavirus can be understood more clearly. He also examines how the mismatched speeds of science and human curiosity can lead nervous people to bad information. The pandemic\u2019s length traps people in a liminal space. To clarify their uprooted life and indefinite future, they try to gather as much information as possible\u2014and cannot stop. \u201cWe go seeking fresher and fresher information, and end up consuming unvetted misinformation that\u2019s spreading rapidly,\u201d Bergstrom says. Pandemics actually \u201cunfold in slow motion,\u201d he says, and \u201cthere\u2019s no event that changes the whole landscape on a dime.\u201d But it feels that way, because of how relentlessly we quest for updates. Historically, people would have struggled to find enough information. Now people struggle because they\u2019re finding too much. Efficiency is Biting Back, by Edward Tenner High-tech upgrades to health systems, living spaces, travel, and more all likely helped spread the coronavirus, which might have otherwise remained an isolated disease. As Americans imagine the better, more efficient society that could be ushered in after months of living our lives mostly remotely, it\u2019s worth remembering that streamlining daily life can have disastrous consequences. In practice, the pursuit of efficiency has often resulted in the consolidation of smaller companies and facilities into larger ones; in greater congestion as more people are packed into smaller spaces, whether in office towers or aboard commercial airliners; and in the tight coupling of deliveries and other business processes in ways that, at least when all goes well, speed up production and reduce warehouse inventories. But consolidation, congestion, and tight coupling may also make our economy less efficient in the long run\u2014and our society more vulnerable to outside shocks such as the coronavirus. Efficiency, in fact, can be hazardous to our well-being, and a strategic amount of inefficiency is crucial in keeping society healthy. Medication Shortages Are the Next Crisis, by Jeremy Samuel Faust With the United States playing \u201ccatch-up\u201d with the coronavirus crisis, emergency physicians such as Faust have wondered whether they should be rationing lifesaving medications more strictly. Many hospitals are running low on the drugs needed to treat COVID-19, endangering both coronavirus patients and people who take the same medications for other conditions. The simplest solution, Faust argues, would be for the federal government to eliminate delays by more closely overseeing the manufacturing and distribution of essential drugs. Here are steps the federal government can take now to make sure that hospitals are well stocked during the pandemic and after it passes, when doctors turn to operations delayed by the COVID-19 surge. First, it needs to improve data collection to track how manufacturing capacity is stacking up against medical demand. Then, it needs to compel pharmaceutical companies and their suppliers to accelerate the production of needed drugs. Doctors Are Holding Up Their End of the Bargain. Society Is Not. by Graeme Wood The role that health-care workers are playing right now is not unlike that of the military during wartime. So why, Wood asks, are we not systematizing the work of doctors as we do the work of the military? If we require doctors\u2019 sacrifice in times of public-health catastrophes, we should also require that their safety and equipment become the burden and priority of the rest of us, he argues. Alex Kon, a physician and bioethicist, says that until about a hundred years ago, doctors regularly fled epidemics. Only since then, after a quasi-military ethos of not abandoning one\u2019s post penetrated the medical profession, did expectations change. Now there is an unwritten \u201ccovenant,\u201d Kon says, according to which doctors hold their positions, and society is supposed to reciprocate by equipping them and practicing social distancing (for example) to keep their hospitals from being swamped. Doctors have abided by that covenant. The rest of us have broken it. We have failed to equip them; we have failed to elect governments that competently manage public health; we have failed to wear masks, avoid crowds, and keep the ERs as empty as possible. Why It\u2019s Important Not to Drink Bleach, by James Hamblin The president\u2019s suggestion that cleaning products could serve as a potential medical treatment for COVID-19 is a public-health danger. Agents such as bleach and isopropyl alcohol are poisonous if ingested. The nonchalance with which Donald Trump implied that they might instead be salubrious demonstrates his disregard for the seriousness of the presidential platform, Hamblin writes\u2014especially in light of his backpedaled attempt to pass his statements off as sarcasm. Trump\u2019s words matter beyond the profound ignorance they betray. Approximately 50,000 Americans have now died of COVID-19. In states of emergency like this, health officials are trained to clearly say what is known and what is unknown, what is actionable and what is not. Trump consistently does the opposite, suggesting something while also saying he is not saying it, making bizarre declarations followed by hedges about how what he just said may or may not be true. The Scariest Pandemic Timeline, by Olga Khazan Despite everything that Americans have been through in recent weeks, the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is possibly still months ahead of us. COVID-19 infection numbers are expected to ebb and surge from now until whenever a vaccine becomes available. The pandemic began as the country\u2019s flu season was winding down, but thanks to that ebbing and flowing, a future wave could overlap with the next flu season. Having to contend with another round of COVID-19 patients while also taking on severe flu cases might cause hospitals to quickly run out of ventilators, beds, or even doctors. Some people might even get infected with both the flu and COVID-19 at the same time. While health experts don\u2019t know exactly how that would make COVID-19 worse, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that would be good,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said.",

                              "text": "About a month ago, Medical News Today started a series aiming to bring together the more encouraging research that emerges around COVID-19. We continue with this Special Feature that focuses on an incoming vaccine and other potential treatments for this new coronavirus and the disease it causes. Share on Pinterest A new vaccine may be available as early as the fall, according to some researchers. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak. With this series, we aim to remind our readers that while COVID-19 causes great sorrow and loss around the world, the resulting global emergency has also meant that scientists are working at an unprecedented pace. They are making progress that is easy to overlook among the worrying numbers of new cases and deaths. Two recent MNT articles COVID-19: 5 reasons to be cautiously hopeful and COVID-19: Physical distancing, drug trials offer hope looked at the latest developments in potential treatments, vaccines, and the outcomes of infection control measures during the pandemic. We continue our series with this third Special Feature, which continues to monitor progress in the areas mentioned above. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. We focus on a vaccine that some researchers believe may be available by the fall and round up expert opinions on this promising development. We also cover an app-based social tracing system that could help create \u2018intelligent\u2019 physical distancing instead of national lockdowns. Ebola drug continues to show promise We previously reported that the World Health Organization (WHO) have launched a global megatrial that involves testing four potential treatments for COVID-19. Remdesivir, initially developed to treat Ebola, was one of those four potential treatments. Now, scientists from the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, say that remdesivir is showing promise in in vitro experiments. The same team had previously demonstrated that remdesivir effectively combatted another coronavirus, MERS-CoV. It did so by blocking polymerases, which are enzymes that allow the virus to replicate. Study co-author Prof. Matthias G\u00f6tte explains, \u201cIf you target the polymerase, the virus cannot spread, so it\u2019s a very logical target for treatment.\u201d He continues to report the results of the team\u2019s new experiments: \u201cWe obtained almost identical results as we reported previously with MERS, so we see that remdesivir is a very potent inhibitor for coronavirus polymerases.\u201d Prof. G\u00f6tte goes on to explain, \u201cThese coronavirus polymerases are sloppy, and they get fooled, so the inhibitor gets incorporated many times, and the virus can no longer replicate.\u201d Still, the author cautions, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be patient and wait for the results of the randomized clinical trials.\u201d New treatment target found Another hopeful finding comes from researchers from Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. These scientists also started their research efforts by drawing parallels with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Namely, they looked at the spike protein that coronaviruses have and zoomed in further on the \u201cfusion peptides\u201d \u2014 these are short-chain amino acids that the spike proteins contain. \u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting about SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and this new virus, SARS-CoV-2, is this particular part of the protein, the fusion peptide, is almost exactly the same in those three viruses,\u201d explains study co-author Prof. Susan Daniel. The new study found that calcium ions enable fusion peptides to help coronaviruses penetrate healthy cells through a process called membrane fusion. This offers a potential target for a new antiviral treatment. The team has already secured funding to start developing an antibody that could stop this process by targeting SARS-CoV-2\u2019s fusion peptide. \u201cBlocking the fusion step is significant because the fusion machinery doesn\u2019t evolve and change as fast as other parts of the protein do. It\u2019s been built to do a particular thing, which is to merge these two membranes together. So if you can develop antiviral strategies to reduce that efficiency, you could have potentially very broadly-acting treatments.\u201d \u2013 Prof. Susan Daniel A vaccine by the fall? Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University\u2019s Jenner Institute in the United Kingdom, and her team may soon be closing in on a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The approach \u201cuses a harmless chimpanzee virus to carry the fragment of SARS-CoV-2 that is required for immunity,\u201d explains Ian Jones, Professor of virology at the University of Reading, U.K. Colin Butter, an associate professor of bioveterinary science at the University of Lincoln in the UK, explains: \u201cProfessor Gilbert\u2019s team [\u2026] have made a recombinant vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by taking a virus that is entirely harmless to humans, the Chimp Adenovirus designated ChAdOx1, and inserting into it the spike protein gene from the [new] coronavirus.\u201d Prof. Gilbert believes that the vaccine will be available for general use by the fall, which could prevent a potential second wave of the new coronavirus. \u201cThat is just about possible if everything goes perfectly,\u201d Prof. Gilbert told The Times in an interview. The researchers are set to put the new vaccine into human trials in the next 2 weeks. The researcher explains that during the pandemic, scientists can fast-track the process through which the vaccine reaches the population by doing many of the necessary steps in parallel. \u201cFirst, there is the need to manufacture the vaccine for clinical studies under tightly controlled conditions, certified and qualified \u2014 we need ethical approval and regulatory approval. Then, the clinical trial can start with 500 people in phase I.\u201d \u201cThis is always in healthy adults aged about 18 to 55, and usually the primary read-out from a phase 1 study is safety,\u201d Prof. Gilbert explains. \u201cThen we can do phase 2, looking at a wider age range; in this case, we are going to increase the age range, 55 to 70 plus. We are looking at safety in the older age group, [and] we expect to see weaker immune responses.\u201d The researcher explains that she and her team plan to spread their studies across different countries so that they can reduce the time it takes to test the vaccine. \u201c[I]t\u2019s vital we go fast before a high proportion [of the population] become infected. But it also means we are going to need to do studies in different countries because the amount of virus transmission is affected by the lockdowns.\u201d The vaccine could get approval \u201cunder emergency use legislation,\u201d meaning that \u201cin an emergency situation, if the regulators agree, it\u2019s possible to use a vaccine earlier than in normal circumstances,\u201d Prof. Gilbert adds. It is worth noting that other experts have expressed concern over Prof. Gilbert\u2019s estimates. Prof. David Salisbury, for example, says, \u201c[I]t is not just the availability of the first dose that we need to focus on. We need to know by when there will be sufficient doses to protect all of the at-risk population, probably with two doses, and that means industrial-scale manufacturing that governments do not have.\u201d The approach in itself, however, is viable, and the research group benefits from a lot of credibility in the scientific community. The approach \u201chas been extensively tested in other situations, so there is indeed a good chance it will work as designed,\u201d says Prof. Jones. \u201cThe [research] group has a long history of success in this area,\u201d adds Dr. Butter. \u201cOn the basis of this prior experience, it would be reasonable to assume that the vaccine would induce antibody and cellular immune responses, both of which may be important in controlling the virus in an individual.\u201d \u201cAny final roll-out will almost certainly need a level of manufacturing the [U.K.] does not readily have, so transfer to and liaison with an external manufacturer may also need to be tackled. But the roadmap is clear, let\u2019s hope they get there.\u201d \u2013 Prof. Ian Jones Trial to test benefits of clot-busting drug Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a drug designed and approved to prevent blood clots in people who have had a stroke, pulmonary embolism, or heart attack. Now, a new trial to test its benefits for relieving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in people with COVID-19 is underway. TPA acts as an anticoagulant. This means it prevents blood clotting by breaking down fibrin. Fibrin can form plugs in the airways and contributes to small clots in the blood vessels of the lungs. In patients with COVID-19, these small microfibrin plugs in the air sacs lead to ARDS. As a result, these patients require ventilators to be able to breathe. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing anecdotally that a subset of patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS are clotting abnormally around their catheters and [intravenous] lines,\u201d explains Dr. Michael B. Yaffe, Ph.D., an acute care surgeon at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, MA. Dr. Yaffe is also the senior author of the study that proposed repurposing tPA to treat COVID-19 complications. \u201cWe suspect these patients with aggressive clotting will show the most benefit from tPA treatment, and this new clinical trial will reveal whether that\u2019s the case,\u201d says Dr. Yaffe. The scientists have started to recruit some of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the BIDMC for the trial. The team also hopes to find biomarkers that can help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from the treatment. \u201cIf effective and safe for the treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19, tPA could save lives by reducing recovery time and freeing up more ventilators for other patients in need.\u201d \u2013 Christopher D.

It is important to remember that, in their labs, scientists are making quiet progress every day \u2014 helping untangle the causes of this crisis and inching closer to stopping it. Share on Pinterest Researchers are working at breakneck speed to come up with ways of treating and preventing COVID-19. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak. A couple of weeks ago, Medical News Today first rounded up emerging evidence that gave us reasons to be cautiously hopeful. In this article, we continue the series by looking at the impact of physical distancing measures, newly launched treatment trials, and hopes for a vaccine. FDA NOTICE The FDA have removed the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on a review of the latest research, the FDA determined that these drugs are not likely to be an effective treatment for COVID-19 and that the risks of using them for this purpose might outweigh any benefits. Physical distancing measures work A new study by Prof. Chaolong Wang and colleagues from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, in Wuhan, China, suggests that the physical distancing measures implemented by Chinese officials prevented more than 90% of possible infections between January 23 and February 18, 2020. Prof. Wang and the team reached this conclusion after having developed a method of predicting virus transmission patterns by looking at population movement, unconfirmed cases, and people in quarantine. The study also predicted that nearly 60% of the people carrying the virus had no symptoms and were not self-isolating. This may have contributed to the quick spread of the virus. These findings are consistent with those of other studies, such as one published in Eurosurveillance that looked at the spread of the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Prof. Gerardo Chowell, a co-author of this study, highlights the importance of physical distancing as the only way to block the chain of contagion in the context of asymptomatic cases. \u201cImplementing strong social distancing measures is the only way to stop the virus from spreading.\u201d \u2013 Prof. Gerardo Chowell, study co-author Another study, led by Prof. Christopher Dye, from the University of Oxford, in the United Kingdom, used large datasets to analyze the movements of millions of people as a result of the nationwide travel ban in China. The travel ban was instated on January 23, 2020. \u201cBased on [these] data, we could also calculate the likely reduction in Wuhan-associated cases in other cities across China,\u201d says study co-author Prof. Ottar Bjornstad, from Pennsylvania State University, in University Park. The scientists considered the number of cases from the beginning of the outbreak until February 19, 2020, the 50th day since the outbreak\u2019s start. They also looked at the cases between January 23 and February 19, having accessed public health records and case reports of COVID-19. During this time, \u201cOur analysis suggests that without the Wuhan travel ban and the national emergency response, there would have been more than 700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan,\u201d says Prof. Dye. \u201cChina\u2019s control measures appear to have worked by successfully breaking the chain of transmission \u2014 preventing contact between infectious and susceptible people.\u201d \u2013 Prof. Christopher Dye  \u2018Megatrial\u2019 of 4 potential new treatments The World Health Organization (WHO) have launched SOLIDARITY, an international megatrial of four possible ways to treat COVID-19. The first trial will look at repurposing remdesivir, a drug that was developed to treat Ebola but proved ineffective for this purpose. The drug, however, seems to be effective against the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Some recent reports have suggested that it may have helped some people recover from COVID-19. The WHO research also seeks to assess the value of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, two antimalarial drugs, and to examine the effectiveness of two HIV drugs \u2014 ritonavir and lopinavir \u2014 used in combination. It is worth noting that another study has cast doubt on the efficacy of HIV antiretroviral therapies as a COVID-19 treatment. But it is also worth bearing in mind that participants in this study may have received the interventions too late. Lastly, in an attempt to boost the efficacy of the antiretrovirals, the WHO team will combine the two drugs with interferon beta, a first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis. The CDC recommend that all people wear cloth face masks in public places where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot (2-meter) distance from others. This will help slow the spread of the virus from asymptomatic people and people who do not know that they have contracted it. People should wear cloth face masks while continuing to practice physical distancing. Instructions for making masks at home are available here. Note: It is critical that surgical masks and N95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers. Repurposed drug could prevent deaths As COVID-19 is placing an increasing strain on healthcare systems across the world, researchers led by Dr. Michael Yaffe \u2014 a David H. Koch Professor of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge \u2014 say that repurposing a blood-thinning drug could reduce COVID-19 deaths and the demand for ventilators. The compound in question is called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and it is ordinarily used to break up blood clots in people who have experienced a stroke or heart attack. In a report published in The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, Dr. Yaffe and colleagues use existing evidence to argue for a clinical trial that would test the potential benefits of tPA. The lead author explains, \u201cWhat we are hearing from our intensive care colleagues in Europe and in New York is that many of the critically ill patients with COVID-19 are hypercoagulable, meaning that they are clotting off their IVs and having kidney and heart failure from blood clots, in addition to lung failure.\u201d Previous studies have shown that drugs with a similar effect as tPA have helped patients with respiratory failure survive. \u201cIf this were to work, which I hope it will, it could potentially be scaled up very quickly because every hospital already has it in their pharmacy,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to make a new drug, and we don\u2019t have to do the same kind of testing that you would have to do with a new agent. This is a drug that we already use. We\u2019re just trying to repurpose it.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Michael Yaffe",

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak. Research from the Imperial College London (ICL), in the United Kingdom, has predicted the likely effects on mortality of two different ways of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings, which are directly informing U.K. policy, suggest that in the U.K. and United States, a policy of suppressing the outbreak, rather than mitigating it, would significantly reduce demand for critical care beds and the number of people who would die. Prof. Neil Ferguson, Director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics, at ICL, is the first and corresponding author of the new study. COVID-19 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), coronaviruses initially transmit from animals to humans. The coronavirus at the center of the current global pandemic has been called SARS-CoV-2. Previous coronaviruses include MERS-CoV, which emerged in 2012 and causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, and SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2003 and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. Although much is still unknown about the virus, the medical community believes that it spreads when a person with the condition coughs or sneezes particles that carry the virus into the air. The virus may also transmit from surfaces to people through touch. Mitigation or suppression Different governments have responded in different ways to the COVID-19 pandemic, placing varying restrictions on the movement of people within countries or entering countries. The U.K. government began with a policy of mitigation, aiming to protect the people most vulnerable to COVID-19: people over the age of 70 and people with underlying health conditions, including anyone who receives seasonal flu vaccines. This initial policy did not involve significant restrictions on the movement of the general population. The government hoped that this would slow the outbreak enough that health systems could still function and enough of the general population would achieve some level of immunity, limiting any repeated rise in infection once measures were finally relaxed. However, the research published by the ICL team has significantly changed the U.K. government\u2019s approach \u2014 which now focuses on the suppression of the virus, advising social distancing for the general population and social isolation for those who have, or who live with someone who has, COVID-19. This approach aims to minimize the spread of the virus until an effective vaccine can be produced. It relies on stringent, long-term, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and isolation. This is because any relaxation of these before a vaccine is developed would result in a large second outbreak, given that fewer people would have developed immunity. As the authors of the new study note, \u201cThe more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity.\u201d The research does not consider the ethical or economic effects of either response. However, these factors may have a \u201csignificant impact on health and well-being in the short- and longer-term,\u201d in countries with a policy of suppression, the authors acknowledge. Their focus, instead, was on the feasibility of the two approaches in the U.K. and U.S., with particular attention to the effects on health services in the two countries. The CDC recommend that all people wear cloth face masks in public places where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot (2-meter) distance from others. This will help slow the spread of the virus from asymptomatic people and people who do not know that they have contracted it. People should wear cloth face masks while continuing to practice physical distancing. Instructions for making masks at home are available here. Note: It is critical that surgical masks and N95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers. Suppression more effective Drawing on data from various sources, the team at ICL created complex models to predict the effects of a mitigation strategy and a suppression strategy. They found that in the U.S. and U.K., both strategies would be much better than doing nothing \u2014 but that a suppression strategy would result in significantly fewer deaths and less demand for critical care beds than a mitigation strategy. In the authors\u2019 words, this means that \u201cA minimum policy for effective suppression is, therefore, population-wide social distancing, combined with home isolation of cases and school and university closure.\u201d The authors note that, while this approach appears to be optimal in the U.S. and U.K., it may not be so in other countries.",

                              "text": "In the US, a slow and confused rollout of coronavirus testing helped the new virus get a foothold and cause what is now a raging outbreak. But drug and biotech companies have been searching for a cure since January, when the severity of the epidemic in China became evident. Among the most promising candidates are antibody drugs, a type that already accounts for most of the top-selling medicines in the US. The goal of the companies looking into antibodies\u2014which include AbCellera, Berkeley Lights, GenScript, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and VIR Biotechnology\u2014is to turn one person\u2019s solution to covid-19 into a drug that can benefit everyone. Antibodies can lock onto the virus and neutralize it. A dose given to the sickest patients could beat back the infection and lower the death rate. These drugs are not vaccines, but because antibodies last for weeks or months in a person\u2019s blood, they could also act like a temporary vaccine\u2014say, to protect health-care workers. If the right antibody can be found, manufactured, and bottled, it could be among the first treatments for covid-19. That means blood from survivors is in high demand. The Rockefeller University in New York blasted out an email in mid-March saying, \u201cHave you recovered from Coronavirus infection? If so, scientists need your help!\u201d The center offered \u201ccompensation and parking\u201d to anyone over 18. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) put out its own call days later. A view of the biomanufacturing space at Regeneron. Antibodies made in bioreactors could treat covid-19. REGENRON Some US hospitals are collecting blood from survivors so the plasma in it can be directly transfused into patients with severe cases. The use of such \u201cconvalescent serum\u201d was tried as early as January as an emergency treatment in China, with promising results. That\u2019s not an ideal solution because serum, which has a large mixture of antibodies present in small amounts, is not as potent as a manufactured drug, and blood donations remain in short supply. Direct transfusions are \u201cnot scalable\u201d as an answer to covid-19, says Rockefeller University immunologist Michel Nussenzweig. Still, the blood from patients who beat the virus is invaluable in the search for specific, powerful antibodies that can be identified and manufactured in a concentrated form so that \u201cwe can give them to other people \u2026 to a lot of people,\u201d he says. Despite the promise of antibody drugs, they may not yield a cure soon. Biotech companies say they will have antibody treatments ready for testing within two to four months, and possibly in larger quantities within half a year. That means none of the custom-designed drugs will arrive in time for the first wave of the pandemic, and they may not even be available in large amounts for the next phase, which in the Northern Hemisphere could happen next fall. Says Nussenzweig, \u201cThe time line is similar to vaccines: it will take about year.\u201d Vaccines, pills, or antibodies Antibody drugs are just one of the approaches being tried. Since the start of the covid-19 outbreak, drug researchers across the world have scrambled to find a treatment. Some have thrown open their libraries of chemicals; other have fired up deep-learning programs to predict what drugs could work. Immediately, doctors in China tried existing drugs, from herbal remedies to HIV medications. By mid-March, there were more than 250 clinical trials under way worldwide, and the World Health Organization (WHO) had launched Solidarity, a global mega-study of four readily available drugs, including one used to treat malaria. More than 60 potential vaccines are also in development. In the face of widespread disease\u2014and a death rate that, according to some recent studies, appears to be about 10 times that associated with the flu\u2014all we have now are \u201cnon-pharmaceutical\u201d measures. Countries are locking down\u2014closing stores, airports, caf\u00e9s, everything but essential jobs. The unprecedented campaigns of physical distancing and, in some countries, tracing infected people and their contacts are aimed at reducing the germ\u2019s chance to move. But the economic price of these steps is already beyond calculation. Any medicine able to shorten the duration of symptoms, or that proves effective in saving the lives of dire covid-19 cases, could ease the toughest trade-offs. If a drug shifted the balance of hope for those who end up on ventilators in intensive care units, we could get back to our jobs while protecting the lives of the weak, elderly, and unlucky. With a treatment that cut the death rate significantly, covid-19 might be a problem, but not an economic disaster. Each major approach\u2014conventional chemical drugs, vaccines, and antibodies\u2014brings advantages and drawbacks. Pills are easy to make and easy to take, but none has yet been proved to work. Vaccines can give protection, but no one can predict when one will be available. (At a minimum it will take 12 to 18 months; 17 years since the world battled an earlier coronavirus, SARS, no licensed vaccine exists.) Antibodies, often given through an IV drip, have the disadvantage that they are complex to manufacture, but the advantage that they copy the body\u2019s own solution. Among \u201cde novo\u201d drugs\u2014those being designed specifically for this germ\u2014expect antibodies to be among the first you hear about. How antibody drugs work Inside your blood system, countless immune cells circulate, each one endowed with a unique antibody. Think of the antibodies as sensors able to identify foreign substances, like germs or cancer cells. The immense diversity of antibodies, made possible by the reshuffling of DNA inside newly born immune cells, accounts for why people can stave off many threats never seen before. If one of the B cells made in the bone marrow recognizes a germ, it will start spewing out its antibody in huge quantities. The time it takes to mount a successful immune response is often about a week. \u201cYou have the potential in your body to encode 100 billion different antibodies.\u201d AbCellera\u2019s microfluidic technology captures individual B cells from a blood sample and segregates them into micro-chambers, where they can be probed 200,000 at a time. A single experiment can determine which of those cells are making antibodies capable of most strongly attaching to the spike protein of the coronavirus, which it uses to enter human cells. The cells making the best antibodies can be removed from the device to have their DNA, the instructions for making that antibody, read. \u201cYou have the potential in your body to encode 100 billion different antibodies,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cThese cells are special because they recombine their DNA, and that\u2019s what our technology is able to sort through, to find the one that can be a therapeutic.\u201d Learning from Ebola How fast can an antibody for the coronavirus be found and start saving lives? The time line to beat, say experts, comes from Ebola, a bleeding disease caused by a virus that flared up in West Africa in December 2013. The disease was fatal about 65% of the time, so when it got into Liberia\u2019s urban slums and even reached the US and Europe with airline travelers, the US began pouring millions into potential vaccines and drug treatments. Regeneron was one of the companies tapped to develop an Ebola treatment. The company, based in Tarrytown, NY, has established a system for finding antibodies using mice genetically engineered with partly human immune systems. The mice are exposed to a pathogen \u201cover and over again,\u201d according to Christos Kyratsous, the company\u2019s vice president for research on infectious disease, so they develop very potent, and entirely human, antibodies without needing blood from a survivor. Regeneron rushed to create an Ebola antibody drug starting in late 2014, \u201cbut by the time we were done, the epidemic was waning, and we didn\u2019t get a chance to use it,\u201d says Kyratsous. It was an example of how drugs can come too late in an outbreak or fail to find a market at all. An antibody Regeneron developed for MERS, a coronavirus that can jumps from camels to humans and kills 30% of its victims, has never been tried on any patient, Kyratsous says. That disease, first spotted 10 years ago, is still so uncommon it\u2019s been impossible to carry out a study. \"People think that if you enter a treatment center, you leave in a coffin.\" Interest in the Ebola antibody would have faded too, but then Ebola flared back up in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). \u201cSo then we had the drug ready to go,\u201d says Kyratsous. In what public health experts say could be a model for how to battle covid-19, a trial was carried out involving 673 patients to compare four treatments. It was less than a year later, Kyratsous says, in August of 2019, that he received a call saying the trial was being halted. It wasn\u2019t a failure; rather, it was too much of a success. Regeneron\u2019s antibody cocktail and one from the NIH (based on an antibody collected from a survivor of a 1995 outbreak) worked so well that it would be unethical not to give them to every patient. Only 34% of patients treated with the antibodies were dying. Among those who got the drug early, nine of 10 survived. The drug promised a transformative effect. It made people with frightening Ebola symptoms less likely to hide from health workers. \u201cPeople think that if you enter a treatment center, you\u2019ll leave in a coffin,\u201d Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, director of the DRC\u2019s National Institute of Biomedical Research, said in the British Medical Journal. \u201cFrom now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable \u2026 We have a great message: a treatment center is a place where you can recover and that you leave alive.\u201d Speeding up the chase With covid-19, people want to hear that they can go back to work, and see friends and family, without putting elderly relatives at risk. A study of the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship that became an accidental corona\u00advirus laboratory, estimated the overall death rate of people with covid-19 infection to be 1.3%. For people over 70, it\u2019s five to 10 times as lethal. As Bruce Aylward, a prominent epidemiologist with the WHO, puts it, \u201cThis is one of the most serious diseases you will face in your lifetime.\u201d If the Ebola trial\u2014carried out in under a year in a war-torn country\u2014is the current record for testing an outbreak treatment, the world hopes to beat that mark now. Regeneron says it plans to pick two antibodies against the coronavirus, and the company\u2019s billionaire founder and CEO, Leonard Schleifer, told President Donald Trump on March 2 that he could have supplies ready in the summer. \u201cWe anticipate, if all goes well, 200,000 doses per month can come out of our factory in New York, starting in August,\u201d he said. By that point an estimated 60,000 Americans could be dead from covid-19 even with strict social distancing measures in every state, according to projections from the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in April. There is intense pressure to accelerate the drugs\u2019 development\u2014to take corners at high speed, if not cut them altogether. But some experts say it\u2019s not necessary to skip steps, something that could doom a drug later on. Instead, Ebola showed it\u2019s partly a matter of spending 10 times the money to go twice as fast. \u201cYou don\u2019t throw out the rules, but you shorten all the steps,\u201d says Myron Levine, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Maryland, who has trained teams in Africa to run vaccine trials. \u201cAn accordion when extended is quite wide, but you push it together and it\u2019s short. You don\u2019t skip steps; you squeeze the accordion.\u201d As covid-19 has spread outward from China, desperate hopes have surrounded any treatment with even a chance of working. From his Twitter account, Trump touted malaria drugs based on the chemical chloroquine, even though the benefits of these are not proven, and the US took steps to make the pills widely available. A microfluidic chip from Berkeley Lights can isolate immune system B-cells and test their antibodies. BERKELEY LIGHTS Covid-19 patients have also made pleas for drugs from their ICU beds, sometimes using social media to try to contact companies. One drug they are asking for is remdesivir, an experimental virus blocker made by Gilead Sciences that is also in clinical trials. After handing out hundreds of doses to severely ill patients on a \u201ccompassionate\u201d basis, Gilead had to temporarily stop, citing \u201coverwhelming demand.\u201d Yet remdesivir was a flop in the big Ebola study. And that shows you can\u2019t tell what drugs actually work without doing a randomized controlled trial, as Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has repeatedly said during White House briefings. That type of trial involves picking some people at random to either get a drug or not get it, and seeing if there turns out to be a difference. That kind of data should be ready soonest for the available chemical pills, chloroquine and remdesivir, which are already being given to patients in organized studies involving thousands of patients. The large number of covid-19 cases means these studies could fill up quickly\u2014and solid proof the drugs work, or don\u2019t, could be in hand by summer. One possible outcome, though, is that these pills will turn out to help only a little, falling well short of a cure. In that case we may need to wait for a vaccine or for purpose-built drugs, like antibodies or custom virus-blocking chemicals of the sort that ended up being able to stop AIDS. Manufacturing project If the pandemic continues to grow, anyone who discovers a new treatment will be hard pressed to make enough of it. That\u2019s especially true for antibodies. During the Ebola trial, each subject got doses as high as 150 milligrams per kilo of body weight\u2014or about 10 grams in all. If a covid-19 antibody is created, millions of people could need it. That means antibodies would need to be manufactured literally by the ton, in a process that involves skimming the molecules from tanks of living cells and drying them into a powder. But the biomanufacturing industry has never been asked to create that much of anything. If there\u2019s an antibody Manhattan Project, it would be to build factories big enough for the job. The largest biomanufacturing facilities in the world cost $1 billion to set up and have as much as 150,000 liters of broths bubbling at once. Carnley Norman, a vice president of manufacturing at KBI Biopharma, which produces antibodies, estimates that one such megafactory might be able to make enough antibody for a million people each year. But what if we needed to treat 10 or 100 million\u2014and what if high doses of several different antibodies were required? At the high end, Norman\u2019s calculation then becomes staggering: we\u2019d need more than 300 such plants, more than exist in the world today. \u201cIf the pandemic goes completely unchecked, we are going to have a problem,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cIf an antibody becomes the only way, we would have to do something very remarkable to treat hundreds of millions. There is a question about whether manufacturing scale-up can keep up with the outbreak.\u201d Quantities of a curative antibody might be severely restricted, leading to difficult decisions about who gets treated, and in what country. Doctors and drug companies\u2014and governments\u2014would have to decide. The sickest patients will need the drugs most, but antibodies work even better if given early on. Giving them prophylactically to health-care workers will be tempting too, especially if supplies are limited. According to Regeneron, just a tenth as much is needed to protect someone for a few weeks as to treat a very sick patient. But all that\u2019s only if we get a drug. And some believe the path to an antibody, like the path to a vaccine, is probably going to be difficult. \u201cWe have to worry about the efficacy and the safety, because this virus has unique features,\u201d says Liusong Yin, who heads discovery of biological drugs at GenScript, a Chinese research company that has 50 people doing antibody screening. He says if the virus mutates, stopping it will demand more complex antibody cocktails that hit it in three or four places at once. And for severe cases, he worries, antibodies can sometimes make people sicker by contributing to a storm of immune activity. Given such concerns, some voices are rising to say that science\u2014and, by extension, clever biotechnology firms\u2014should not make excessively optimistic claims. The trouble is that the virus isn\u2019t well understood. Basic facts about it remain unstudied, including who is most vulnerable and why. Yet companies are pushing forward, which means biotechnology is being built on a foundation of scientific unknowns. In an editorial, Holden Thorp, editor of the journal Science, compared the undertaking to \u201cfixing a plane that\u2019s flying while its blueprints are still being drawn.\u201d He knows that the efforts could fail: \u201cI am worried,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat science may end up overpromising on what can be delivered in response to coronavirus disease 2019.\u201d But the alternative is that the plane crashes. And few racing to find a cure are ready to accept that fate.",

                              "text": "As efforts to find an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 ramp up, an immunologist warns that fast-tracking of clinical trials could be catastrophic. Share on Pinterest A newly published commentary warns against the dangers of fast-tracking the clinical trials for finding a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak. Scientists around the globe are working to develop an effective vaccine for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Until such a time, the world is reliant on physical distancing measures and personal protective equipment (PPE). Some countries are using \u2018track and trace\u2019 systems to monitor the movements of people and notify those who have been in contact with somebody diagnosed with COVID-19. Of course, a treatment for COVID-19 is also highly desirable. Gilead\u2019s anti-viral drug remdesivir appears to accelerate recovery time in some people. The United States and the United Kingdom have now authorized its use as a treatment for people with COVID-19. However, as remdesivir is a treatment, not a cure, and some clinical trial results show no significant benefit, a vaccine remains preferable. Although a COVID-19 vaccine is urgent, scientists cannot rush the development process. In a recent editorial, immunologist and deputy editor of the journal Science Advances Dr. Douglas J. Green explains why bypassing essential clinical trial stages for any such vaccine could be \u2018catastrophic.\u2019 The full comment is available to read in the journal Science Advances. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. The vaccine development process There are currently 95 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in development. After the discovery and pre-clinical development stages, each of these must progress through three phases of clinical trials. Phase I involves safety testing in a small cohort (e.g., 10\u201350 people). Phase II trials involve investigating the immune response in a larger cohort. Phase III trials involve much larger groups of people (sometimes in the thousands) and must show, in a statistically significant manner, that the vaccine can protect against infection. This stage alone can take several years under normal circumstances. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this is too long to wait. Most estimates indicate that a vaccine is 12\u201318 months away. This is due to streamlined processes, such as accelerated pre-clinical testing and regulatory review processes. Some experts have also advocated for \u2018fast-tracking\u2019 some clinical trial stages. They suggest that evidence that a vaccine triggers the production of neutralizing antibodies could be sufficient to progress to widespread implementation. The article in Science Advances warns that this route could be dangerous and says scientists must conduct comprehensive safety tests for any potential vaccine. Understanding the immune response The article raises concerns about a repeat of the 1966 trial for a vaccine against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), which can cause serious illness in young children. After the vaccine trial, many children still contracted the virus and suffered even worse symptoms than before. Two children died as a result. Research conducted much later showed that the vaccine failed because it did not generate the necessary protective antibodies as the immune system had not been properly primed against the virus. This type of immune response, which is specific to a particular pathogen, is called adaptive immunity. It contrasts with innate immunity, which is the body\u2019s first line of defense and is not specific to a particular infection. Adaptive immunity involves the production of specific antibodies, which is what the majority of vaccines aim to achieve. It involves a type of immune cell called helper T cells, also known as CD4+ cells. The immune system requires these cells to produce strongly binding antibodies. This occurs through a process called antibody affinity maturation. In the failed RSV vaccine, there was a lack of antibody affinity maturation, which caused the children to have a worse response than usual when they contracted the virus. Studies of immune responses to SARS-COV-2 have found that the numbers of CD4+ T cells are crucial for overcoming the disease, which is a vital consideration for vaccine development. Antibody-dependent enhancement The failure of the RSV vaccine highlights the importance of fully understanding the immune response before progressing to clinical trials. Another way a vaccine can cause harm is through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This means that antibodies produced against the virus also bind to receptors on host cells, which ultimately means that the virus is more likely to infect them. Experts have observed this effect in vaccines against Dengue, Ebola, and HIV, and in a coronavirus in cats. However, several studies of SARS-CoV vaccines in rhesus monkeys \u2013 a much closer relation to humans \u2013 have shown no evidence of ADE. Slow is fast As well as the scientific roadblocks, there are many ethical hurdles to overcome before performing studies of experimental vaccines in people; studies that may pose significant risks. Dr. Green says that scientists must way up these \u201cextreme risks\u201d against the potential benefits. The take-home message of the article is that while time is of the essence, it is essential to ensure the safety of any potential vaccine. It is vital to ensure the safety of any vaccine, including a full investigation of its potential adverse effects. Rushing this process could have catastrophic consequences, says Dr. Green, who recommends the application of the axiom \u2018Fast is slow, and slow is fast\u2019 to COVID-19 vaccine development.

And, please, follow theorfor guidance on protecting your community from the disease. Copied-pasted-and-shared social media posts allegedly written by anonymous experts have been a central feature of the misinformation epidemic associated with the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. These posts, which frequently promote suspect advice or inaccurate information, evolve into multiple, slightly modified versions and have frequently gone viral on social media platforms. At issue here is one such post displayed below, which has been attributed to, among others, \u201can immunologist at Johns Hopkins University.\u201d The post usually begins this way: \u201cFeeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu? Here it is in a nutshell. I hope this helps. Feel free to share this to others who don\u2019t understand\u2026 It has to do with RNA sequencing\u2026. I.e. genetics.\u201d The post makes several points, but only a few are accurate. A majority of the claims rest on the false assumption that the coronavirus mutates at a faster rate than other viruses. Below we will go through the post point-by-point. \u2018All Human Virus\u2019 The post asserts that, unlike the seasonal flu, this novel coronavirus mutated from a viral strain originally found in an animal and therefore no human\u2019s immune system recognizes the virus. This differs from the seasonal flu, according to the post\u2019s author, as most humans have some innate level of immunity to influenza strains in general. This is true, according to experts. Matt Koci, a professor of immunology, virology, and host-pathogen interactions at North Carolina State University told us by email that while \u201cbiology is more complicated than that,\u201d the \u201clack of no one in the human population having any prior immunity to is a major factor to why this is so much worse than seasonal flu.\u201d Another factor, he told us, is that a few anti-viral drugs have been developed that blunt the impact of some influenza strains, but no such tool exists for the coronavirus. Animal-to-Human Mutation in \u2018Just Two Weeks\u2019 The post asserts that mutations in the RNA or DNA of a virus sometimes allow for animal-to-human transfer, but not human-to-human transfer. It then implies a second mutation event is required to allow for human-to-human transfer, and therefore a possible pandemic, to occur: Now, here comes this Coronavirus. It existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long. But one day, at an animal market in Wuhan China, in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from animal to people. At first, only animals could give it to a person. But here is the scary part. In just TWO WEEKS, it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human. Scientists call this quick ability, \u201cslippery\u201d. While most viruses mutate multiple times in the process that allows transfer between animal-human and then human-human, \u201cthere is no data that I\u2019m aware of that supports the details in this statement,\u201d Koci told us. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what animal it \u2018jumped from\u2019 so there is no way to know how long it took before it evolved the ability to move from person-to-person,\u201d he explained. The virus most closely resembles a coronavirus found in bats. In fact, this virus may have been pretty much perfectly set up to infect humans right off the bat, so to speak, and therefore would not have required the alleged multiple quick mutations to produce human-to-human transfer. Speaking to Ed Young in The Atlantic, Matthew Friedman of the University of Maryland School of Medicine explained that this novel coronavirus differs from the coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak because this one required no modifications to thrive in human cells after its jump from animal to human. Unlike the coronavirus that caused the original SARS, this new one already possessed the ability to recognize a key protein in human cells named ACE2. \u201cIt had already found its best way of being a [human] virus,\u201d he told The Atlantic. \u2018This Virus is Slippery AF\u2019 The post claims that a quick ability to mutate allowed the virus to mutate \u201cin such a way the way [sic] that it causes great damage to human lungs\u201d and that this fast mutation rate is \u201cwhy Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1, or any other type of influenza.\u201d The post asserts that the coronavirus, compared to other viruses, mutates unusually fast, i.e. that it is \u201cslippery AF.\u201d This is not true. \u201cThe virus has been remarkably stable given how much transmission we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Lisa Gralinski, a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, said in the same Atlantic interview. \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d she said, referring to its strong initial ability to infect human cells \u201cbecause there\u2019s no evolutionary pressure on the virus to transmit better. It\u2019s doing a great job of spreading around the world right now.\u201d David Ho, an epidemiologist at Columbia University\u2019s Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, also made this point in a Q and A interview. \u201cThis virus is mutating but it has mutated very little so far,\u201d he said. \u201cThis virus does not seem to mutate any faster than we would expect,\u201d Koci concurred. \u201cIt is mutating, all viruses do, and over time, the randomness of these mutations may spit out a new variant that is worse, but current rates of mutations do not seem unusual for these types of viruses.\u201d Mutation rates also do not have anything to do with the damage COVID-19 causes to the lungs in some individuals, according to Ho. \u201cThere are differences [in various strains],\u201d he said, \u201cbut probably they are functionally not important, so that\u2019s not the explanation for why you see different disease courses among the infected,\u201d he said. The Mutation Rate Makes It Hard to Develop a Vaccine for COVID-19 The post accurately asserts that there are now two primary strains of the novel coronavirus, but inaccurately suggests this is unusual or a central problem in developing a vaccine for the virus: It\u2019s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain S and strain L\u2026which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine. While multiple strains may complicate vaccine production efforts, it is unclear if the two present strains \u201care different enough that they would need separate vaccines or not,\u201d Koci told us. More important, mutation rates and multiple strains would not be the reason for the potentially long time frame in the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Influenza, as a comparison, mutates season to season, and epidemiologists are able to predict with varying degrees of accuracy which strains will spread each season thanks to a massive and international monitoring effort that collects data for this purpose. This information guides the production of flu shots for a given season. \u201cWe do this for [the] flu, so we should be able to do it for this [novel coronavirus] too. The difference,\u201d Koci told us, \u201cis we\u2019ve been studying [the] flu for almost 100 years. We have a pretty good idea of how we need to change the vaccine each year to keep pace. It may take a while until we understand the differences in coronavirus strains at the same level, but we\u2019ll get there.\u201d Given the tools modern science has and the number of labs working on the problem world wide, Koci believes \u201cwe will catch up to where we are with our understanding of [the] flu pretty quick. If It Mutates Again, Who Is to Say What It Will Do Next? The post ends with a combination of good advice and misleading scare statements. The majority of the viral Facebook story is predicated on the false belief that the novel coronavirus mutates at a faster rate than other viral pathogens like influenza or even previous coronaviruses. There is no evidence to support that, in part because this novel coronavirus was, improbably, perfectly adapted to infect humans from the outset. The fear, then, is not of an unknown about how mutations could change the disease to make it even more scary. Instead, the central fear expressed by many epidemiologists is that the public will not take the necessary precautions to slow its spread and, as a result, will overload the health system. That a large population of people will likely be infected with this disease in the coming year is likely, but how deadly that infection could be depends in large part on slowing the rate at which people develop new infections. The reason for this is to create conditions that allow for these inevitable new cases to occur over a broader period of time, not all at once in a way that overloads the medical care system of a region. In the hard hit areas of northern Italy, the outbreak of new infections took place in a dangerously short period of time, necessitating hard decisions like denying ventilators to older patients less likely to survive. Staying at home is not only about preventing yourself from infection, it is, in most cases, primarily about preventing yourself from infecting multiple other individuals in a short period of time. In that light, the final point made in this viral post is a good one: \u201cStay home folks.\u201d",

About 1.6 million people have recovered. Nearly three million laid-off workers in the US have applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total since coronavirus shutdowns began two months ago to over 36 million. Officials have confirmed the first coronavirus infection of a Rohingya refugee in the sprawling camps in southern Bangladesh, where over 1 million members of the persecuted Muslim ethnic group live. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has surpassed 250,000, but daily new infections fell below 10,000 for the first time in nearly two weeks. US authorities have accused China-linked hackers of breaking into organisations in the US researching the coronavirus. The United Nations is forecasting that the pandemic will push an estimated 34.3 million people into extreme poverty, mostly in Africa. Japan has lifted a state of emergency in most parts of the country. Here are the latest updates: Thursday, May 14 22:30 GMT - US Senate approves bill to pressure China over Uighur rights The US Senate approved legislation calling on President Donald Trump's administration to toughen its response to China's crackdown on its Uighur Muslim minority, as Trump blames Beijing for worsening the coronavirus pandemic. The bipartisan bill, introduced by Republican Senator Marco Rubio, calls for sanctions against those responsible for the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim groups. It specifically singles out a member of China's powerful Politburo as responsible for \"gross human rights violations\" against them. 21:35 GMT - New York Stock Exchange to reopen The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) trading floor will partially reopen on May 26, over two months after it closed down to control the spread of the coronavirus, NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Cunninghma said floor brokers will return in smaller numbers at first and wear protective masks while they work, adding that brokers and visitors will be screened and have their temperatures taken as they enter the building. 20:55 GMT - US CDC issues guidelines on reopening schools, transit and workplaces The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines to help schools and workplaces determine whether they are ready to open for business. The six so-called \"decision trees\" cover yes or no scenarios that are aimed to help assess readiness for opening workplaces, restaurants and bars, mass transit, childcare, camps and schools. 20:45 GMT - EU top diplomat wants independent probe into coronavirus origins The EU's foreign policy chief has called on China to contribute significantly to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and said there should be an independent scientific investigation into the origins of the pandemic. In a guest column in Friday's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Josep Borrell said China should act to help protect the world from future pandemics. \"An independent scientific investigation of the origin of this pandemic is also necessary,\" he wrote. 20:20 GMT - Groups ask India to rescind Gilead's COVID-19 drug patent Two health advocacy groups have written to the Indian government asking it to rescind patents given to Gilead Sciences for the drug remdesivir so it can be distributed more fairly to coronavirus patients around the world, particularly in poorer nations. Remdesivir is the only drug approved to treat COVID-19 after promising early trial results prompted United States regulators to grant emergency use authorisation on May 2. To expand its access, Gilead said this week that it had signed nonexclusive licensing pacts with five generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan, allowing them to make and sell remdesivir for 127 countries. But health access groups say the pacts mean cheaper forms of the drug may not become available in nations seen as nonprofitable to the five drugmakers. Read more here. A public address is made from a loudspeaker attached to a rickshaw for a mobile COVID-19 testing van operating in the area during a lockdown imposed due to the coronavirus in New Delhi, India, on Monday [File:T. Narayan/Bloomberg] 19:50 GMT - Cases of children with rare inflammatory syndrome spike in Italy and France Doctors in northern Italy, one of the areas hardest hit by the new coronavirus, and in France have reported spikes in cases of a rare inflammatory syndrome in young children that appears similar to one reported in the United States, Britain and Spain, according to a report in The Lancet. The condition, \"Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID-19,\" shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease including fever, rashes, swollen glands and, in severe cases, heart inflammation. Reports of cases have raised concerns that COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could pose a greater risk to children than had been understood. It has so far taken its greatest toll on the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. 19:35 GMT - Whistle-blower tells Congress US lacks vaccine plan Whistle-blower Rick Bright warned on Thursday that the United States lacks a plan to produce and fairly distribute a coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available. The nation could face \"the darkest winter in modern history\" unless leaders act decisively, he told a congressional panel. Bright alleges he was removed from a high-level scientific post after warning the administration of US President Donald Trump to prepare for the pandemic. Bright said, \"We don't have [a vaccine plan] yet, and it is a significant concern.\" Asked if lawmakers should be worried, he responded, \"absolutely\". Read more here.

Some of them are in the United States but even more of them are in Europe and France.\" The group's chief executive Paul Hudson said on Thursday it was vital that any coronavirus vaccine reach all parts of the world, after angering the French government earlier by saying the United States would get priority access. 18:45 GMT - Will working from home work? Companies have been forced to embrace remote working to limit the spread of COVID-19. But that's if the job doesn't require you to be there in person. For those who can, working from home could become permanent. Twitter is going to give that option to workers who wish to do so.

Britain released the app on the island off the southern coast of England earlier this month. Shapps said the app would eventually be used to check compliance with a proposed 14-day quarantine for international travellers. An app to trace contacts with people potentially infected with the coronavirus is being trialled on Isle of Wight [sla Binnie/Reuters] 18:00 GMT - Vatican to introduce temperature checks at St. Peter's Basilica People attending Masses in St. Peter's and other papal basilicas in Rome will have their temperature checked as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, the Vatican has said. It did not say when the new measures will take effect. Public Masses will resume in churches in Italy on Monday under strict conditions outlined in a protocol signed last week by Italy's bishops conference and the government. St. Peter's is on Vatican territory and the other three papal basilicas - St. Paul's Outside the Walls, St. John's In Lateran and St. Mary Major - have sovereign, extra-territorial status and so technically are not part of Italy. The new rules for churches in Italy include limiting numbers, distancing and masks but they do not impose thermal scanning, meaning the papal basilicas will have even stricter rules.

More: 16:45 GMT - Trump says US-China trade deal 'doesn't feel the same to me' United States President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was very disappointed in China over its failure to contain the novel coronavirus, saying the worldwide pandemic cast a pall over his trade deal with Beijing. The coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China in December and was spreading silently as the US and China signed a phase one trade deal hailed by the Republican president as a major achievement. \"I'm very disappointed in China,\" Trump said in an interview that was broadcast on Fox Business Network. \"They should have never let this happen. So I make a great trade deal and now I say this doesn't feel the same to me. The ink was barely dry and the plague came over. And it doesn't feel the same to me.\" 16:30 GMT - France says it will take reciprocal steps if Spain quarantines its visitors France will impose reciprocal quarantine measures on travellers coming from Spain after Spanish authorities' decided to impose a 10-day quarantine on travellers from France, an official at the French presidential palace has said. The official said France wanted to avoid such measures but would take reciprocal steps if countries decided to impose quarantine measures on travellers from France. It was not immediately clear when such a measure would take effect. 16:15 GMT - Italy's daily death toll and new cases climb Deaths from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy have climbed by, against 195 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new cases rose to 992 from 888 on Wednesday. It was the largest number of deaths in one day since May 7. The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21 now stands at 31,368 the agency said, the third highest in the world after those of the United States and Britain.

In March, the International Olympic Committee and the Japanese government decided to delay the Games, due to start this July, for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. \"We anticipate we will have to bear costs of up to $800 million for our part and responsibilities in the organisation of the postponed Games Tokyo 2020,\" Bach told a conference call at the end of the executive board meeting. 15:40 GMT - Europe halts delivery of 10 million 'poor quality' Chinese masks The European Commission said on Thursday it has suspended the delivery of 10 million Chinese masks to member states and the United Kingdom after two countries complained about the poor quality of the batches they received. After the first batch of 1.5 million masks was shipped to 17 of the 27 member states and the UK, Poland's Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski said the 600,000 items Polish authorities received did not have European certificates and failed to comply with the medical standards required for their distribution. \"We have decided to suspend future deliveries of these masks,\" Commission health spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker said. \"We will then see what action needs to be taken if there is indeed a quality problem with these masks.\" European Commissioner in charge of Health Stella Kyriakides wearing mask before a news conference on the strategic orientations of the European Tourism and Transport Package at European Commission in Brussels, Belgium [Olivier Hoslet/EPA-EFE] 15:20 GMT - Italy launches blood tests to investigate extent of outbreak Italy will start testing a representative sample of 150,000 people in 2,000 cities next week to understand the extent of its COVID-19 epidemic, the head of the government's scientific committee has told parliament. Italy has had more than 222,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and over 31,000 deaths since its outbreak came to light on February 21. Most of them have been in its northern regions, while the south has escaped largely unscathed. \"This testing programme will involve a significant sample of citizens and will allow us to understand the (extent of the) national spread of the virus,\" said Agostino Miozzo, the head of the scientific committee. 15:00 GMT - Moscow to launch free mass tests from May 15: Mayor Moscow will begin free mass testing of citizens for the coronavirus from May 15, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said on his website, with a target of 100,000 people a day by the end of the month. Around 70,000 blood analysis tests will be offered every few days, in the initial roll-out, Sobyanin said. 14:45 GMT - Yemen reports first cases in Al Dhalea province Yemen's Saudi-backed government has reported the first cases of the novel coronavirus in the southern province of Al Dhalea, among 15 new infections that took the total in areas under its control to 85 with 12 deaths. The Aden-based government's coronavirus committee said in a Twitter post that Al Dhalea, the ninth province to record cases, had its first three infections. The war-ravaged country is divided between the Saudi-backed government based in the south and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls the capital Sanaa and most large urban centres. Houthi authorities have reported only two cases with one death, both in Sanaa. 14:30 GMT - Bangladesh, UN say first case detected in Rohingya refugee camp The novel coronavirus has been detected in one of the camps in southern Bangladesh that are home to more than one million Rohingya refugees, officials have said. An ethnic Rohingya refugee and another person had tested positive for COVID-19, a senior Bangladeshi official and a UN spokeswoman said. It was the first confirmed case in the camps, which are more densely populated than most crowded cities on earth. \"Today they have been taken to an isolation centre after they tested positive,\" Mahbub Alam Talukder, the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, told Reuters news agency by phone. The other patient was from the \"host population\", a term usually used to refer to locals living outside the camps, the UN spokeswoman said. Read more here.
